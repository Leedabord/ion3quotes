Batman crouched on his perch atop a local museum, completely enveloped by the shadows around him. He hated Wakefield Wharf in the summer. The seeping heat and coastal mist combined to create a dank, humid environment that made him sweat much more than usual. Sweat underneath his fearsome cowl was always an unwelcome experience, causing the Kevlar/Nomex material to chafe his skin and scalp. Such was the life of a crimefighter, he supposed. Because of his extreme dislike of the area:.s climate, Batman made it one of the sections of the city that was known to be his. His voice became deeper in the Wharf; he made his attacks more personal, his justice more severe. It was most often the criminals he caught in the Wharf that spoke of him as a demon or wraith, and he preferred it that way. The more forbidding his reputation in the area, the less frequent his visits would have to be. As a result, Bruce Wayne would require fewer facials. Bruce Wayne hates facials.
