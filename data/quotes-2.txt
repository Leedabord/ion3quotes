“If you’re really Danny, describe for me the dress your sister wore last week when I took her out.”
“I don’t have a sister, Jack, and if I did I wouldn’t let you near her.”
~
“Colonel O’Neill has officially informed that I have my ‘mojo’ back.”
~
“Can these devices be removed?”
“Not without causing irreparable brain damage, sir.”
“What’s the down side?”
~
“As long as I am in command of this army, we will hold ourselves to the highest ethical standard.”
“And when the enemy wipe us out because we have nothing with which to defend ourselves, I’m sure we’ll all feel great about ourselves and our high moral standard.”
~
“Come to retrieve your ‘vastly superior stuff’? You know it’d be a lot more superior if it wasn’t so easy to steal.”
~	
“Question is, will they listen?”
“Well, the real question is, will they have ears?”
~
“I never expected that you would amuse me.”
“I never expected you to put your hand in my head.”
~
“Is there any chance that you could get the Russians to give us their DHD?”
“Not without giving back Alaska.”
~
“Well, that never happened in any of the simulations.”
~
“If I were still loyal to the Goa’uld, you would know it. It would be immediately apparent, as I would not hesitate to kill you where you sit.”
~
“Hey, don’t you die on me now.”
“What difference would it make?”
“Because we’re about to be rescued.”
“Oh, that’s nice.”
“Isn’t it?”
~
“It’s always suicide-mission this, save-the-planet that. No one ever stops by just to say ‘hi’ anymore.”
~
“You know, we really should come up with a new strategy. One that does not include us dying.”
~
“Thank you Baldwin, but I have to go help Murray, um…wait for Daniel.”
~
“Are you conducting some sort of scientific experiment, O’Neill?”
“Hey, come on, that salsa’s still good.”
~
“Now we die.”
“Well that’s a bad plan.”
~
“We have to go in disguise; pretend to be foreigners.”
“How do we do that?”
“Well, I speak twenty-three languages, Jack. Pick one.”
~
“I’m not asking you to change the course of their development, just fix the damn sun! No one will know. We won’t tell.”
~
“If we want to find out who’s behind this, we have to do what the Asgard do.”
“You mean bluff?”
“Yep. We just need to do it without revealing what we know.”
“Which is nothing…”
“Right. But they don’t know we know nothing.”
~
“On Chulak, a dispute between a man and a woman that cannot be resolved necessitates a pledge break. It must be requested by one and granted by the other.”
“And if that doesn’t work?”
“A weapon is required.”
~
“Daniel, will you tell them who I am? Please?”
“OK, love to. Who are you?”
~
“Would anyone care to speculate how a boy could be aware of our most classified information? He can’t be more than 15 years old. Are you saying Colonel O’Neill has somehow regressed more than 30 years overnight?”
“Stranger things have happened.”
“Name one.”
“Well, there was the time he got really old; the time he became a caveman; the time we all swapped bodies…”
~
“Its size remains constant. Rather, it is we who are moving away at extreme velocity.”
~
“So this iris is going to hold, right?” 
“Pure titanium, less than three micrometers from the event horizon. It won’t even allow matter to fully reintegrate.” 
“So this iris is going to hold, right?” 
“If it doesn’t, the fail-safe device will detonate, this whole mountain will vaporize and there’ll be nothing to worry about.” 
“Ah, good. I feel much better.”
~
“We know it is ruled by a group known as Peacekeepers.” 
“Doesn’t sound too bad.”
“They are a violently xenophobic military organization reminiscent of the Nazis of your second world war.”
~
“I just asked if the solar flares were going to be a problem, and you said they could seriously impact the mission.”
“So?” he said, now genuinely puzzled.
“I was speaking Latin.”
~
“When you turned, I noticed the bulge in your coat where a holster would be, and we’re past the security checkpoints. I didn’t think that an airport security agent would drink here, so that leaves either a federal agent or a terrorist—and a terrorist wouldn’t call attention to herself by engaging me in conversation. Unless—of course—you’re a very clever terrorist, in which case I’d request that you shoot me somewhere that won’t show; after all, it’s always nice to leave a pleasant-looking corpse.”
~
“You never told us you have sisters Jack.”
“I also never told you that my favourite colour is not green Daniel.”
~
“It’s Victor’s idea. For Mardi Gras.” 
“Wasn’t that last week?”
“Yup.” I say nodding. “Logistical problems.”
~
“She’d rip my spine out and use it for a coat rack.”
“You’re invulnerable.” Bruce pointed out.
“She’s very resourceful.”
~
“Ah, maybe I have a natural immunity.” 
“Perhaps you will develop symptoms later.” 
“Thank you for the moral support.”
~
“I guess congratulations are in order. You made General.”
“You made King!”
~
The real problem was what the village people had told him that he was required by law to wear for the signing of the treaty which declared that they ‘shall not poke one another with sacred sticks nor steal each others chickens’.
~
“Two months ago, we went to POX 979. It was a typical mission gone awry.”
“Did Daniel die?”
“No, not really.”
“Couldn’t have been that typical then.”
“They made clones of us. Teal’c’s didn’t survive the cloning process…”
“As usual.”
“…Daniel’s clone sacrificed his life to make sure we got to the gate.”
“Hey! You told me Daniel didn’t die!”
~
“Oh Daniel got attacked by a giant blob of goo,” O’Neill answered with almost a casual tone.
~
“And you can’t stop yourself from touching extraterrestrial goo!” retorted the Colonel. 
Daniel didn’t correct Jack. “The goo touched me!” didn’t seem like a good counter-argument. 
~
The aliens are still sneering and trying to communicate with me. I’m only half listening, because I don’t have any clue what language they’re speaking and that rock hit the back of my head hard enough I don’t care. The only part I understand is when they point empathically at me and say, “John Crichton.” I would then point to myself and say, “No, Daniel Jackson.” And then the yelling would start again.
~
“I said don’t move,” the voice told me irritated, but there’s a teasing note in it that told me this guy isn’t worried about me at all.
“Raising my hands seemed the appropriate thing to do. Prisoner etiquette and all that.”
~
“How should I know? I was looking for my friend when you came around threatening to shoot me.”
“He did not, in fact, threaten to shoot you.”
“Right. Okay. So sorry. When he came and held his gun to my neck in an entirely innocent manner.” 
~
“In that case you deserve a Congressional Medal of Honour for putting up with him.”
“He makes me one out of bottle tops every year for our anniversary.”
~
“Hover? Like a hummingbird?” 
“With teeth.”
~
“You were the one who said trusting me would be your undoing, is it my fault you didn’t take your own advice?”
~
“I just got a little wasted last night and ended up somewhere I shouldn’t have and now I am trying to sort things out.”
“Is she pretty?” Daniel asked with a laugh.
~
“You seem to be picking up dreadful habits. I can actually see irritation on your face.”
~
“Could you find it in your heart to be a little supportive of me if those females turn into faucets again?” he said, hoping it didn’t sound like he was begging.
~
“Even in winter, some things can be nourished.” It wasn’t an answer and it had a creepy quality that made Tony want to grab his gun.
~
“People don’t care about the truth.” She told him, and it was either the weirdest name in history, or not really an answer to his question.
~
“Under no circumstances do you open the door or answer the phone. And leave the lights off, as far as anyone is concerned, no one is here, got it?”
“I got it Jack. This isn’t the first time, you know.”
Jack just gave him a look, and then shaking a finger in the man’s face stated adamantly, “I mean it, no blowing up my house!”
~
His kidnapper, internally dubbed Gravel Voice, gave Jack a hard disbelieving glare before punching him rather hard in the stomach.
~
“Excuse me! Hysterical anthropologist with a gun here! What is going on?!” 
“Daniel, this is all just a bad dream.” 
~
“Did you really smuggle yourself out of Berlin in a coffin, fight off an army of ants, and defuse a missile with only a paper clip?” 
“Not in that order.” 
~ “O’Neill, would you like some coffee?” 
“No thanks Teal’c, I don’t-” 
“O’Neill,” Teal’c interrupted the man and calmly repeated, “would you like some coffee?” 
MacGyver looked up at him surprised at first, but then quickly replied, “Why yes Teal’c, I would love some coffee, thank you.” 
~ “We ran out of paper and needed to get some more.” 
“From a medical storage room?” 
They all looked around as if for the first time. “Good point.” 
~
“Your real name’s Dexter Fillmore, you had a twin brother named Mike, you saw HIT kill him, testified and now you’re under the Witness Protection Program. Mike and I were mixed up at the hospital but you and I never met till after your new identity so to keep from uncovering it that’s why we keep our relationship a secret.” 
“And they believed you?” 
“Sort of, but I think they’re highly suspicious.” 
“Why Dexter?! 
~
“I found your spare key. You know, under a rock is one of the most common hiding places in America?” 
“Is that where it went?”
~
“What did you destroy?” 
“Nothing!” Mac instantly exclaimed but glancing away reluctantly added, “That worked to begin with.” 
~
“I wasn’t there myself, but I heard it was a rather spectacular explosion.”
~
“How many fingers?” 
“I don’t know, your hand’s behind your back.”
“Good. What’s your name?” 
“Jack,” Mac protested. 
“No, that’s me, remember?” 
~ 
“He will come, and we will go to meet him, and then we will watch the destruction of your planet.” 
“Well that sounds pleasant,” Jack sarcastically grumbled. 
~
“You know, if you wanted me to visit, all you had to do was ask. This whole almost dying from a bizarre illness is a little over the top.”
~
Life, in all, was good, even if it did sometimes give him a black eye.
~
“Wow. Do you think we’re going to crash?” He asked, sounding far calmer than Jack would have expected him to.
“Probably.”
“Okay.”
~
“You help me break my friends out. Lana’s too injured to help, and Fred’s too small to hold a decent weapon.”
“I am not small! I am well proportioned.”
“Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.”
~
“You’re escaped prisoners?” 
“Well, I’m not. I’m a liberated prisoner.”
~
“Why? What was so important it had to be destroyed?”
“Not important, just wrong.”
“And for this you burned the incorrect information?”
“Well, shot it actually. I was a little stressed.”
~
“John, we have a problem! That ship is going to explode.”
“Why am I not surprised?” 
~  “You know, in almost every culture, cooking is a part of the woman’s domain. Even among modern egalitarian societies, originally cooking was the woman’s job.”
“Well in our modern egalitarian society, I order out.”
~
“You look damn sexy in dresses.” She just gave him a look that could melt iron. “I know, I know, can’t kick, can’t punch, and can’t hide a knife worth grabbing. What if we made special pockets?”
~
“Alright, I vote we escape.” 
~ “We need our weapons.”
“Daniel? Wasn’t Sam really interested in getting a look at their guns and how they worked or something? And weren’t you just fascinated by the artwork on Dario’s sword thing?”
“Oh,” said Daniel with a small grin. “Yeah, very interested.”
~
“What the hell are you doing?!”
“Escaping. What are you doing?”
“Rescuing.”
“Okay. Well... mission accomplished.  Can we get out of here?”
~
Sara turned, drew herself up to her full height, and glared. Linda Park let out a small squeak and backed up a step. Diana felt sorry for her.
~
“That larcenous jackal must surely be engaged in illegitimate financial schemes!”
Wash interjected, “Not that we aren’t familiar with illegitimate financial schemes.”
~
“Mmm, well I have fancied myself quite the rebel, you know. Most men wear their monocle over the right eye, for example.”
~
“What’s ‘A’? And why are you having dinner with it?”
~
“What have I got to do to keep you out of my office? Lay down a mine field? A moat and drawbridge?”
~
“I’m having dinner with my accountant while we go over a few things, all right?”
“Is that what they’re calling it these days?”
“Yes, House. Marjorie, my accountant, and I have been having a torrid affair for the past eight years—never mind that she’s happily married, or a woman.”
~ “Yesterday I fell in a lake and got shot at. And then again, today I got shot at and my home was turned into a war zone. No, I don’t have a phone, thank you very much. What about you?”
“I’ve got three, but I forgot them because I went chasing after someone who decided to put a new doorway in my house and get my girlfriend shot!”
~
“We aren’t done holding these folks hostage yet! I am not in the habit of offering tea and dumplings to people I’m holding a weapon on.”
~
“If you’re ever here again …I’ll know something is very wrong.”
~
“Has this wall always been here?”
“Lois, I think that wall actually holds up the roof. How long have you lived here again?”
“I’m just taking inventory. Someone has to account for what we did on those missing days, and if you kill someone, the first thing you do is erect a wall to stash the body.”
~
“Deliberate disobeying direct orders, breaking out of the hospital wing against Madame Poe’s advice, breaking into the Ministry of Magic with your illegal Defence Association, leaving Hogwarts on the back of a thestral, and battling Death Eaters without backup. Now, there are a number of things to keep in mind before punishment is sentenced. One, that has to be the strangest list of offences a parent has ever had to work with. Two, you survived, which makes me ridiculously happy.”
~
“Also, I have to keep in mind that, while wrong, I have snuck out of the hospital wing many a time. Tonight, most recently.”
“So we’ll knock that off the list too?” Harry asked hopefully.
“No.” James said. “It’s firmly on this list. I’m just going to keep my own actions in mind.”
“You’re horrible.” Harry said, sounding quite firm about it himself.
~
“A small, hardly noticeable spot on your chin is infinitely preferable to the kabuki mask you slather on in your efforts to hide that you are in fact a human being.”

Sirius made a motion as if to do something particularly violent to Remus’ head, but he resisted.
~
“You know that I would marry you in a volcano if you wanted to.”
“A volcano?”
“I would marry you in liquid hot magma, Pam. This is serious stuff, stop laughing.”
“I’m sorry. You’re right. Very serious business. I suppose the bridesmaids would have to wear orange and red then, huh?”
“Obviously.”
“I would marry you on a glacier.”
~
“I swear that looks like a flock of flying pigs.”
“It is a flock of flying pigs. And of course they’d be able to shoot lasers out of their snouts!”
~
“Ah.” said Arasar wisely. “You hate them because they’re Gryffindors. What a wonderful, sensible and unbiased reason. And what’s your excuse? I suppose it’s ‘They’re Slytherins’?”
~
“I need two buttered croissants, some fruit, three pieces of toast and extra large bacon and three sunny-side up eggs before I can talk.” said Arasar firmly.
~
“You remember when we first met and I kind of kidnapped you?”
“Vividly.”
~	
“I take it I don’t get a couple of weeks to get over the fact that I think you are both delusional?”
“You have precisely five minutes before we are due to report back to our plane. That time is all yours.”
~
“That’s because you weren’t the one she had her attention on. She’s an honest to god Napoleonic Power Monger…”
“You’re just sore because she isn’t afraid of you…”
“…Blood sucking vampire…” 
“...In fact, it sort of looked to me like you’re afraid of her. And those nurses…” 
“…Sadistic demon in a white coat…” 
“…know you too well Jack. They treat you just like you’re supposed to be treated: like a little kid.” 
“Hey… little midget wolf in sheep’s clothing…”
“You done yet?”
“Nope. Oppressive slave driver …”
~
“I think you have the wrong girl, you twit. I work in deep-space radar telemetry.”
“Lieutenant, we know who you are. You graduated with a Psych degree. That has nothing to do with radar. Cut the bullshit.”
“What you think you know is obviously far from the truth. I’m studying the psychological effects of prolonged exposure to space. Therefore, you are a moron and I suggest letting me go before something unfortunate happens.”
~
“I would ask Jack except I’m pretty sure he’d just lead me to an abandoned elevator shaft and throw me down it.”
“Would not! I know you. You’d get out of that somehow. I would duct tape you in a sheet and set fire to you, then stick your ashes in a Tupperware container, then chain it up and throw it to the bottom of the ocean on POX-8282.”
~
“Sir, do you know what this briefing’s about?”
“Why is it everyone always takes me for a fountain of knowledge? Why is it everyone always looks to me for the answers? Is it my rugged good looks? Or just that air of information that lingers around me?”
“It could be that, for some unfathomable reason, someone put you in charge.”
~
“‘Those who come here must be prepared to—offer? No, sacrifice. Must be prepared to sacrifice a measure of their love.’”
“Mind translating that into English for me?”
“That was English.”
“Well, you know, English usually makes some sense. Where I come from, at least.”
~ “So...is this like a ‘abandon hope, all ye who enter here’ type thing, or something we should actually pay attention to?”
~
“Jack, we need you at the Mountain ASAP.” Jack didn’t respond other than mentally willing Hank to just hang up. “Jack, are asleep?”
“I was,” Jack growled and then sighed heavily. “Is the world ending?”
“No.”
“Then what the hell are you calling me at-” he glanced quickly over at the bedside clock. “0234 for?”
“Mr. Grey is here.”
“So? Mr. Grey is always popping in all over the place. Or popping people away. Unless the fate of the world is at stake, Mr. Grey can wait until a decent hour.”
~
Jayne did crude and gruff as a matter of personality; this guy did intimidating with nothing more than a lift of the eyebrow.
~
“You know, I thought today was going to be a quiet day. Get out, take some sun, breathe some air, buy Zoë something slinky and without too much material, go back and head back out again. But, no, now it’s all guns and shootouts and how to make your own bombs.”
“Distraction purposes.”
“Damage purposes. Although, I’m not opposed to large quantities of damage in situations like this. Just as long as the damage happens to other people.”
~
He should have expected Carter would find something to blow up. Of course, previously, she’d stuck to smaller thing: vehicles, ships, buildings. Half a town was a new order of magnitude for her.
~
The Mayor was proving obstinate until Reynolds’ mercenary stabbed a bit of meat on the tip of his knife and started eating it with great relish. Then it occurred to him that he’d endangered the friends of some rather dangerous people, and his attempts to retreat and make things right were a thing of great beauty and greater amusement.
~
“Well... there was this one line near the end, it was either, ‘the Tau’ri delegation will be expected at the location within one of your days’, or ‘your mother screeches with the consistency of a nocturnal bat’. It’s all in the inflection and intonation.”
~
“Let me get this straight. There is a secret society of people out there who have the potential to live for ever, and they have nothing better to do than run around killing each other?”
~
“I’ve been around since before the Watchers were founded and let’s say, the first one who tried to trail me was… a bit clumsy at it. Needless to say that I wasn’t exactly happy about being stalked. But since I wanted to know why he was following me around like a lost puppy I asked him.”
“You just asked him?”
“Of course not, I had to be subtle. I got him drunk out of his skull and then I asked him. He was very generous with his information.”
~
“Daniel? Why didn’t you tell me you still had your knife on you?”
“You didn’t ask?”
“For future reference: consider yourself asked every time.”
~
“If in doubt, do not point and laugh at the person in the funny hat. Funny hats often conceal tribal leaders and shaman.”
~
“Do not taunt rogue NID agents. Even if they started it. Nor if you were pre-empting them starting it.”
~
“I simply decided to be on the winning side in this conflict once more, you idiot…”
“The ‘winning side’ in this case being the side that lost the last time?”
~
“Can I see them?” Daniel asked at the same time Jack said: “Can I burn them?”
~
“Well, I’m going to go talk to Hammond about getting you some clearance.  I think the President owes me a couple favours.”
“The president?”
“Yeah, you know, might have heard of him?  Run’s a little government called the United States.”
“And he owes you a couple favours?” 
“Kind of helps to save the world… a few times… a month.”
~
“My water just broke, Jack! The baby’s coming!” 
“No, it’s not,” Jack refuted immediately. “Your due date isn’t for another nine days.”
“Then how do you explain the chair?”
“Um... you spilled your drink?” he answered weakly.
“I didn’t have a drink!”
“Well, why not? Your doctor told you to drink plenty of fluids. He said you should probably try to have something nearby all the time.”
~
Just introduced General O’Neill to the new Russian Ambassador, he was actually quite civil to him; he didn’t try to shoot him, not even once. I think command of the base has really brought him down to earth…Damn. The Russian Ambassador has gone missing. General O’Neill looked a little too innocent when I brought the subject up with him. Shit.
~
Siler outdid himself by setting fire to Senator Kinsey. The grin on his face hasn’t twitched for the last half hour, am beginning to get scared. O’Neill’s talking of promoting him. Wonderful idea, just what Siler needs, extra encouragement to set fire to things.
~
I do not have time for this. How the grunts have managed to lock themselves in the bathrooms that have no locks I don’t know.
~
Apparently, Colonel Carter didn’t realise Siler was quite that protective of her. Geniuses are such idiots. I mean, be serious here. Would a pyromaniac be impressed by a woman who blew up a sun? Let me think. It’s a match made in a very fiery and explosive hell.
~
On plus side, incarceration may help aid me avoid one of Siler’s sprites birthday parties later on this week. Last time I attended one of those I wound up in hospital. The bloody blast was picked up by Norad, the entire base went onto Defcon 3.
~
Had to explain to Siler why he’s not getting to put in a requisition form for twenty-five new flame throwers. Every year this happens. Every single year he puts one in and every single year he still manages to look like a kicked puppy when I tell him he can’t have it. I feel horrible, it’s just not fair. One should not feel overwhelming guilt for trying to save the lives of half the people on this base, not to mention any passing diplomats or politicians.
~
Siler’s just radioed in. He’s had a little accident in Dr. Jackson’s lab. Siler doesn’t have little accidents. Siler has full scale disasters. The last little accident of Siler’s we had involved rebuilding half the alpha site. Just please tell me the little incident didn’t involve a flamethrower and anything remotely flammable. I know that’s asking for a lot but just this once. Oh thank God. The roof’s fallen in. I think I’m probably the first person to juxtapose ‘The roof’s fallen in’ with ‘oh, thank god’.
~
Although I admit, seeing him faint when he walked into his room and found it filled with a truck full of lemons was priceless. And no, I have no idea how they were purchased, transported and arranged in his quarters without my knowing and no paper work whatsoever. Or for that matter the slight error in that month’s balancing books. The fact that it roughly adds up to…oh, say, the exact price of purchasing and transporting a truck load of lemons is a complete and utter coincidence.
~
Sometimes I wonder why we keep the man around. Then I remember he happens to be the only man capable of keeping the power supply running with an air freshener, a tube sock and a bread knife.
~
Have just received message from Daedalus wondering at what point “1 crate of lemon juice, keep out of contact with Dr McKay you idiots.” became “1 tonne of lemons please deliver directly to Dr. McKay.”
~
At some point during my two-week vacation, General O’Neill decided it would be a good idea to barricade the base, seal off the mountain, and declare it a sovereign country.
~
Bomb Squad has determined there aren’t any claymores in the large piles of mashed potatoes outside the entrance. Just mashed potatoes. Scientists are still advising Hazmat’s. Chef’s trying to claim compensation.

“T-R-A? Initials? The beginning of a name?”
“It doesn’t sound familiar. Could be a Travis, or a Trainer, or...traitor.”
“Wonderful,” Roberts said. “May I say I truly hope there is a Death Eater called Travis?”
~
“I’m sorry about Fleur. I have a feeling I’d best get used to saying that. The child has all the tact of a drunken poltergeist.”
~
I think I’ve discovered a whole new level of inappropriately frivolous thoughts. The weight of the world on you, a whole war going on out there, and I’m thinking, ‘You know, Anna Garvey was right... he does have a cute bum.’
~
“Well, I’d best get back to London, before my wife decides that you’re my mistress. Which would at least make more sense than the one I’ve got, as I occasionally have time to see you, which is more than I can say for Rachel.”
“Except for the part where I’d curse you into next month.”
“That would be a significant inconvenience.”
~
“How many kittens did Grady have?”
“I lost count around twenty. My cat had a much more active social life than I did.”
“Your cat had a more active social life than Contessa Zabini. Of course, you didn’t give the right number...”
“If I were a Death Eater, I’d have made up a number.”
“Good point.”
~
“You know, it’s a damned shame that I don’t find you remotely attractive.”
“Not really. Then I’d have to bring up that you’re abysmally ugly, and everything would get awkward.”
~
“You think you’re so clever, don’t you? Do you think I don’t know what kinds of ideas you’ll try to fill their heads with?”
“So far, we’ve had conversations on the seditious topic of dancing. The girls were debating whether or not it was forbidden.”
“And the boys?”
“Have you ever met a boy who would particularly care?”
~
“Yes, well. I told him that if he could teach me to forage for paper and hunt dangerous wild pens, I’d be happy to do so.”
~
“If God Himself came in here and offered to help you, you’d shake your head and say, ‘Thank You, really, but You just don’t understand.’”
“Yes. I suppose I might. Though if there’s a God, I somehow doubt He’s got time to worry about one old werewolf.”
“I seem to recall something about every sparrow...”
“Perhaps I should make an effort to turn into a man-eating sparrow once a month.”
~
He looked at the twins suspiciously, as if they might develop Dark Marks at any moment, and confess to hiding all of the missing persons in the cellar of Zonko’s.
~
‘North American train whistles blow in the minor seventh chord,’ his brain announced in what Sam was pretty sure was supposed to be a helpful tone.
~
“Fuel ratios need to be calculated. Reactors need to be rebuilt to control tyleum flows. Computers need to reprogrammed with revised engine performance statistics. Not enough data on dynamic quantum nuclear properties of tyleum has been published to make accurate predictions on power output. Probable outcome is runaway reaction resulting in catastrophic containment failure.”
“Huh?”
“We’d blow ourselves up.”
“Oh, that’s bad. Don’t do that,” he ordered, wagging a finger at them.
~
“Giles? You are aware that there is a time difference, and it’s, like, 4 in the morning here, right?”
“The time difference between Rome and London is rather immaterial when I am sitting in a coffee shop half a block down the street.”
“Oh.” She sat up, instantly alert. “When is it?”
“When is what?”
“The apocalypse, why else would you be here? When is it?”
~
“We’re here about the Gem of Kadaari.”
“A very interesting myth, that one.”
“So is there some kind of protocol for this? A secret password or something?”
~
“Stay low, stay quiet, stay calm,” he whispered. “If you panic, they’ll smell it.”
“Great,” muttered Kaylee. “Weren’t scary enough without knowing that...”
~
“Who’s Davey Jones?”
“The sea,” Sparrow said, as if it were obvious. 
~
“Furthermore, of the four guys who worked there at the same time as Lois and who claim to have slept with her, none of them actually have. At least, none of them have ever seen her naked.”
“What? How the hell do you know that?”
“Because they can all describe, in detail, a birthmark she doesn’t have.”
~ “But it’s still good to see you! It’s fantastic, actually! Once that wears off, I am going to be very angry with you…Nope, still happy to see you!” The goofy grin spread again from ear to ear on the Doctor’s face. “You’re mad,” Ro told him with wonder.
~
He looked even happier that she’d got his name right, and Claire was starting to worry that if he looked much happier he would explode.
~
“So what exactly are you a doctor of?”
“Oh this and that. Mostly that, but enough this to get by.”

“Meanwhile, House is up on the fourth floor throwing SOS messages from his balcony in protest. Go ahead and laugh, you didn’t have to deal with the guy who almost got brained by a stapler with a note wrapped around it saying ‘help, I’m a prisoner of the establishment’.”
~ “I know it’s none of my business…All right, so I do consider it my business, and you’re both just going to have to put up with my obsessive need to monitor the situation as it unfolds.”
~
“I can’t tell you what I don’t know.” 
“You will, or you will die.”

“Hathor was the Egyptian goddess of fertility, inebriety, and music.”
“Sex, drugs, and Rock ‘N Roll?”
“In a manner of speaking, yeah.”
~ “My ex-husband said, ‘Are you out of your mind, honey buns? There is a reason they call it this man’s army.’ So of course I explained to him it wasn’t the army, it was the Air Force and they’ve had women for decades.”
~
“Well, it’s just that I’ve never actually heard you referred to as a diplomat. I think, um, antagonist was the word used.” 
~ “I don’t know what that means, exactly, but it’s beautiful.” 
“Which is exactly what it means.” 
~
“Basically, scientists have theorized that there are an infinite number of dimensions, each containing a different possible version of reality.” “Well it sounds like I theoretically, possibly, actually found one.”
~
“Well, that sounds ominous.”
~
“Why did you attack us?”
“Attack? Oh, attack. Yes, of course it would seem to be that way from your perspective. Yes, I did that.”
~
“Why didn’t he just tell us?”
“Probably afraid we’d damage him.”
“Perceptive little runt.”
~
“Loosely translated, it means turn back.”
“Does it elaborate?”
~
Daniel’s hand unconsciously moves towards a non-existent weapon. She doubts he even realizes it.
~
Jack tries his damnedest to look fierce.
~
“You like her,” Daniel observes, mid-reach for a bowl of banana pudding and Jack’s mind automatically whirls into motion. Step One: Plausible deniability. Jack makes a sound of disbelief. 
“She’s a scientist,” he says with the proper amount of disgust. After all, everybody knows Jack O’Neill can’t stand scientists. 
“She’s also beautiful.” Jack wonders if Daniel is truly deluded enough to think that he is subtle. Step Two: A little misdirection never hurts. 
“Really?” Jack asks. “I hadn’t noticed. Maybe you should ask her out.” Daniel just stares back at Jack in hurt disbelief. Oh, right. Probably not the most sensitive thing to say to a married man who is desperately trying to save his wife. Step Three: Avoid collateral damage. Jack waves his fork at Daniel in a way that only the linguist would be able to interpret as an attempt at an apology. When Daniel rolls his eyes and shrugs, Jack knows he has been forgiven. Step Four: Strategic retreat. Jack mentions the latest mission and actually listens to Daniel prattle on about his findings in penance. The rest of the meal passes in boring, but safe, work-related discussion. Jack is just enjoying his last bite of cake when Daniel attacks again. 
“You know, she was asking me about you the other day.” Jack lowers his fork to the table with deliberate casualness, making a vague sound at the back of the throat as if he has no idea what ‘she’ Daniel is referring to. “Yeah,” Daniel continues, ignoring Jack’s pathetic attempt at subterfuge. “We had a nice long chat.” Jack doesn’t care. He really doesn’t care. He doesn’t want to know what she asked and he really doesn’t want to know what Daniel might have told her. Because it’s not like Daniel would tell her about the time he turned into a caveman or when he drank that stuff that made him take all his clothes off and sing. Daniel wouldn’t do that. Right? Jack looks up to find Daniel smiling deviously. Step Five: Fall directly into horribly obvious trap. 
“What did you tell her?” Jack demands before he can remind himself again how much he doesn’t care. 
Daniel’s mouth pops open and he jabs an accusatory finger at Jack. “You do like her,” Daniel chortles. 
“I knew there had to be a reason you’ve been so much less of an ass lately!” Jack stares at Daniel in abject horror as the archaeologist clears his tray from the table and makes a hasty exit from the room.  
“I’ll have you know I’m just as much of an ass as I’ve always been!” Jack yells indignantly after Daniel.

Sam doesn’t usually swear like a sailor, but it seems like the appropriate thing to do.
~
“I asked Smelts what colour the sky was and she said green! That proves she’s beyond a doubt dumber than a soap dish!”
~ Jack gingerly raised a hand to his throbbing head. Yep, it was still attached. Unfortunately.
~
“Anything you’d like to share, Mr. Collins?”
“I have a deep and profound desire to make several crude hand gestures at this moment, but am only refraining because Holly is here?”
~
“Simple English, Pettigrew. I’m the only one who can kill Voldemort.”
“We’re screwed.” James said and turned to Lily. “What do you think about Canada?”
~ “Well, she took the car,” Lois noted, slightly impressed.
“You don’t have to be so happy about it.”
“Hey, she snagged my keys, snuck out of my apartment and stole my car. That takes guts. A slightly criminal mind, but guts.”
~
“Fine, I’ll never do it again.”
“Yes you will!”
“All the more reason this impending discussion is pointless.”
~
“Well, on the bright side, my hand isn’t blurry anymore.”
~
“Another friend.” The word dripped with meaning. She let out an exasperated sigh. 
“Yes. A friend. Wally is my friend. Diana is my friend, too. Kindly stop insinuating that I sleep with everyone I know.”
~
She could think of ten ways to kill him right now as they drove on towards her home, double that if she didn’t mind making a mess.
~
His rapport with the press involved seeing how rudely he could address them without having his remarks censored when and if they aired.
~
“But if I back down-”
“Because a guy known for blowing up city blocks because his laundry got ruined is focusing on you? Spike’s Law number three- never piss off a crazy with a bomb.

“I’m as relieved as I am disappointed, and both of those things lead to drink, so that’s a plus.”
~
Someone had let loose a stampeding herd of Frapilatarians in her head. During mating season, it felt like.
~
She blinked her eyes open and immediately shut them again. Needles. Someone had put needles in the air, and they were stabbing her eyes.
~ “It’s okay. I’ve got you.”
“Okay, good. But who’s got you?”
“Gravity?”
“Gravity’s good.”
~
“General Hammond, request permission to beat the crap out of this man.”
~
“Listen, you’re a sitting duck down here.”
“And ducks are bad?”
“Ah, the sitting kind are.”
~
“Sorry, guys.” I gave them my best ‘I’m Covert Ops and I know a dozen ways to kill you with a pencil’ smile. “It’s classified.”
~
“I escaped. What about you?”
She grinned at him. “You’re not the only one who can escape.”
“So how did you?” he asked. “I bet my escape was more impressive than yours.”
~
“Give me a call when she sets herself on fire. Then we’ll get the team over there and roast marshmallows.”
~
“Oh, she doesn’t need any advice, and I wouldn’t be pompous enough to offer it.”
~
“Well, my translation is a little bit vague. I think the circle means ‘the place of our legacy’...or it could be ‘a piece of our leg’ but the first seems to make more sense.”
~
“He gambled we would show compassion even to our worst enemy. He was right.”
“The only compassion I showed was by not blowing his head off.”
~
“My orders are to forget I ever saw it, Sir, so I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
~
“Oh. Well, it’s hard to say.”
“Some sort of state secret?”
“No, just difficult to pronounce.”
~
“You’ve never responded to my emails.”
“I never received your emails.”
~
“You never take me anywhere nice.”
“That’s because you can’t be trusted in polite society.”
~
“You’re making it worse.”
“It’s already worse.”
~
He had to admit that they were efficient. Ten minutes after his arrest, Jack was locked in one of the base’s cells, stripped of his coat, jacket, cap, tie, gun and wristband. Under different circumstances, he might have been grateful to be rid of the tie.
~ “Even if it had absorbed your memories, I find it hard to believe it could imitate your unique ability to get to people quite so well. I think some of the guards are holding a raffle for who gets to shoot you.”
~ He had a suspicion that Jack learnt new swear words and saved them up, just for occasions like this.
~
“I try not to shoot people unless I have to, in the hope that they’ll return the favour.”
~
“I’ve actually been known to eat insubordinate employees.”
“I’m sure you have, sir.”
~
“Do you not remember the joys that we will share in one another’s arms?”
“I really try not to.”
~ “Alright, let me cut to the chase on this one. You want us to help you find this snake head, who, if he’s here at all, would be hiding within one of 6 billion people on Earth?”
~ “You have a rather insubordinate subordinate, General.”
“He’s not insubordinate to me, only to people such as you. Saves me the trouble.”
~
“I just got off the phone with the President.”
“Of the United States of America? Sweet! How’s he doing?”
“Seems to have a thing for you. In fact, I am to issue you an emergency special agent credential. He’s put you in charge of this operation.”
“Excellent. My first order of business—get me one of those cool jackets. Extra large. Double XL if you’ve got it.”
~
“Excuse me, sorry for interrupting. What just happened?”
“Well, apparently we said hello, insulted each other, and broke for recess.”
~
“I have explained our position. To borrow from a human euphemism, it is not a perfect galaxy.”
“I’m sorry; I get a little testy when faced with the total annihilation of our little corner of it.”
~
“You ever seen one of these things work? ‘Cause there’s nothing more I’d like to do right now than demonstrate.”
~ “In the future, Major, before you activate any device that includes the word ‘reactor,’ I’d appreciate it if you would notify me.”
~
“Yeah, I know, it’s against regulations, right? You two look pretty good together, let me tell you.” 
“Kowalski, during your special ops training in your world, did they cover silence?”
~ “Who are you? My First Prime killed you before my very eyes.” 
“I’m feeling much better, thank you.”
~
“You’re a pain in the mikta.”
“Neck?”
“No.”
~
“Have you not read the Bible, O’Neill?”
“Oh, yeah. Yeah. Not all of it. Actually, I’m listening to it on tape. Don’t tell me how it ends.”
~
So, how long you going to keep this up? The demon bit? Don’t get me wrong, it looks like a great gig. You’ve got the padre in your back pocket, the hours are good, probably get all the chicks.
~
“Pretending to still be dead will just get you into more trouble.”
“More trouble than dead?”
~
“Apophis wanted me to tell you you’ve been doing a wonderful job. Couldn’t ask for more. Well done. But, he also wanted me to tell you that the whole invasion of the Tauri idea has been cancelled due to...rain.”
~
“It’s ‘Go to hell,’ actually, which, by the way, is a very rude thing to say to a person offering you a sandwich.”
“I will reveal nothing. You may begin torturing me.”
“Oh, I’ve already begun. This is the infamous tuna torture.”
~
“Who would you trust with your life more than anyone else in the world? Don’t worry, I won’t be offended if you don’t pick me.”
~
“And no one ever asked her how she escaped from an inescapable prison?”
~
“Without wanting to sound overly dramatic, the fate of the galaxy may be at stake.”
“Sounds a bit overly dramatic.”
~
“Just rain. A lot of rain. Wind, lightning, hail, and did I mention the rain, Sir?”
~
“How’s a needle in my butt going to get water out of my ear?”
“It isn’t. Come on, Sir, you know this is standard procedure.”
“We should rethink this procedure.”
~
“No harm will come to you.  The Tollan will guarantee it.”
“Is that a money-back-if-you’re-not-completely-alive guarantee?”
~
“We asked Lord Zipacna about your accusations and he denied it.  He was quite offended.”
“Well that’s a shocker.  I hope you didn’t take his word for it.”
~
“Doctor, are we entirely sure that the members of SG-1 are...what’s the word?”
“Sane?” “That’s the one.”
~
“Well, there’re a lot of things we could help you out with.  Medicine, technology, education.  We’d become friends.”
“We’re already friends.”
“Closer friends.”
“My mother taught me to be wary of men wishing to become closer friends.”
“Well, if you’d like, I’ll negotiate this treaty with your mother.  That way there’d be no conflict of interest.”
~
“I just hammered a few nails.  Well, actually, I made the nails first and then I hammered them, but....”
~
“To be fair, General, I did it alone.  Carter and Daniel protested.  And Teal’c...well, he really didn’t say anything, but I can tell he was opposed to my actions by the way he...cocked his head and raised his eyebrows....”
~
“You are proof that my theories have been all wrong.”
“Then perhaps you would be better off if I were no longer alive.”
“I am a scientist.  When I find evidence that my theories are wrong, it is as exciting as if they were correct.  Scientific advance in either direction is still an advance.”
~
“I believe he wishes us to take off our boots.”
“Yeah, look, ah, we’ve been walking a ways today....”
“Your journey has just begun.”
“I’m just saying I think I’m doing us all a great favour by keeping these babies on.”
~
“You know me, I’m a huge fan of subtlety, but that’s downright cryptic.”
~
“No, Nick, I’m real.  I’m real.  You’re not hallucinating.”
“Hallucinations always say that.”
~
“It’s a friendship built on him not rubbing my nose in how much cleverer he is than I am, and me not rubbing his nose in what a lousy soldier he makes.”
~
“As ever I see you have your mind firmly focused on the essentials. The most important matter under consideration in a situation where you have been kidnapped and are now tied up in the back of the truck is definitely the fact you have started wearing odd socks…”
~
“I hate the way women always take refuge in logic when a situation gets tense.”
~
“It’s okay, sir. We’re all worried about Daniel. Of course the rest of us are managing to be worried about him without throwing glassware around, but if you feel the big dramatic gesture is appropriate, you go right ahead, Jack.”
~
Teal’c strode into the room like the Wrath of God. At least I’ve never actually experienced the Wrath of God on a private, one-to-one level, but I’ve always imagined it would look a little like a pissed off Jaffa in a confined space who has just been told beating the crap out of Harry Melbourne isn’t an option at the moment, son. And how do I know it isn’t an option at the moment? Because I have already suggested to General Hammond the merits of that particular strategy and been told it isn’t on the agenda at the present time, Colonel.
~
He’d never really liked really big men, the ones with doorway-filling shoulders and those expressions that suggested you were about as significant as bacteria because you’d never learned to throw a weirdly shaped ball.
~ “Ow!” he repeated pointedly as he stared up into a face that was curiously expressionless.
~ He wondered if Jack could work out which kind of gun was being jammed painfully into his jawbone without looking at it.
~ He would try to think of them as an…alien culture, that was it; a culture whose strange rituals he had an obligation to respect even when they made no sense whatsoever unless you were eight parts testosterone and two parts Ferro-concrete, particularly between the ears… And they couldn’t hit him just for thinking insults now could they?
~
Darting a sideways glance at the one who wasn’t pushing him forward at just the right pace to jar his twisted knee and bruise his flinching feet, he met the gimlet gaze of a man who looked ready and willing to hit him for even looking like he might be thinking something insulting. Daniel swallowed and decided raked gravel was way more interesting than he’d ever given it credit for up until now. Just look at those striations, almost shell-like, those little spits of stone so pale in the moonlight, and what kind of stone was this anyway…?
~ There are guys out there who have killed their wives, beaten their children, or shot complete strangers because they were having a bad day, who are probably going to see sunlight without bars in front of it before Robert Makepeace.
~
Jack had given him some tips about What To Do If Captured And Tortured, but he’d kept it very general, like this was something he’d heard about which hopefully Daniel would never need to use.
~ He peered at them myopically but could only see a blur. All the same, he had no doubt they were priceless. He had no doubt they were stolen either, but not from a gallery or museum. They would have been stolen from the dead. Even the white lilies on the coffee table seemed to be telling him these pictures had been ripped from the walls of murdered Jews.
~
He twisted his head round to glare at the soldier who’d hit him, wanting the man to see he wasn’t afraid. All right, that wasn’t strictly true, but you couldn’t let people think hitting you was going to make you do what they wanted or they’d only do it more.
~
“Our intelligence suggested you would be a much easier man to persuade to work for us.”
“Well, my intelligence is telling me translating anything for you is not something I’m going to want to do.”
~
In the white light of the chandelier he could see the man was indeed as enormous as he’d appeared in his apartment, bigger than Teal’c and apparently carved from basalt.
~ I explained the situation in as few words as I could, studying his face for clues as I did so. Except there were no clues. Makepeace knew squat. I could see it in his face. This was a waste of time and Daniel was probably already dead.
~ I don’t want to die, O’Neill. And if I say too much I’m going to meet with an accident. All I can tell you is the people behind this wouldn’t waste their time knocking off one lousy archaeologist.
~ Makepeace, being Makepeace, couldn’t work out why I was looking like I wanted to rip someone’s head off. And to be honest I didn’t know I was looking that way myself until he said, “Christ, O’Neill, you look like you want to rip someone’s head off.”
~ In comparison, these guys were cavemen. Neanderthals. He could out-think them, and when Jack, Sam, and Teal’c turned up, they could hopefully beat the crap out of them for him and let him watch. That was a warming thought. He was going to hang onto that one.
~
“If killing someone would get this show on the road any quicker I swear I would put a bullet in the goddamned Pope before taking out Bambi with the rest of the clip.”
~ ”I’ve been storming into rooms, yelling, and storming out of them again so often I’ve got to the stage where I can’t even remember if I’m supposed to be storming or yelling at the moment.”
~
“Colonel Maybourne is being questioned in the matter of Doctor Jackson’s disappearance.” The spook said it like I’d hurt his feelings.
I gave him a straight look. “Not by me and Teal’c he’s not. That’s another thing, sir. Teal’c is getting seriously…restless. If we don’t find him someone to go and stomp on sometime in the next hour or so, I think it’s going to get messy.”
~
One way or another we were getting Daniel back, and if Plan A didn’t pan out, I’d started fine-tuning Plan B. I’d already decided I was giving the general two more hours to cut through the red tape. If he couldn’t give me Makepeace, I was flying to Washington to put a bullet in each of Harry Maybourne’s kneecaps. Then I was going to ask him where Daniel was. And if he didn’t tell me, I was going to hand him over to Teal’c. As back-up plans go, I’ve had worse.
~
The other one was standing by the door just in case he made a run for it. Yes, that was very likely. After no sleep and no food for God knows how many hours, the first thing he was going to do was try and fight his way out past six foot four of immovable sadism.
~
“I’m warning you, Doctor Jackson, my patience isn’t limitless.”
“Mine is,” Daniel assured him. “To be honest, working with Jack, it really has to be.”
~
They never seemed to grasp the fact he actually walked a lot better when he wasn’t being dragged.
~
“I’m trying to be patient but, by my calculations, Daniel has now been a prisoner for fifty-six hours twelve minutes and counting and it takes about four seconds to break a human bone if you apply the right kind of pressure. Of course it takes even less than that to pull the trigger of a gun, but I’m not thinking about that right now.”
~
I didn’t add that I reckoned he had about four more words in the friendly bank before Teal’c pulled the trigger on that zat gun, but I did give Teal’c a warning look, trying to remind him with just my eyebrows Makepeace was our best chance of getting Daniel back alive. Teal’c made a quiet sort of rumbling noise like one of those volcanoes that are supposed to be dormant then erupt the hell all over everyone, but he didn’t actually pull the trigger.
~
Jack was always telling him he needed to take an hour a week to polish his cheating and lying skills. That was what all those poker games were for, Jack always insisted, and yes, damned right they had to play for money. Daniel was never going to learn how to win if losing didn’t hurt a little. As he was yanked away from the smell of hot meat and warm bread and oh-God-he-was-so-hungry, Daniel tried to think of an occasion when he had beaten Jack at poker. As he was all but thrown through the doorway into a wide corridor with a parquet floor and yet more rugs, Daniel remembered oh yes that was right, he’d never beaten Jack at poker. Not once.
~
“If the guy wasn’t such an amoral slimeball you’d almost have to admire his initiative.”
~
Damn it, Daniel, don’t even think about being dead. Be alive, Daniel. Anything else we can fix. But being dead is kind of permanent.
~
“I’m not crying in front of Makepeace…” he muttered while glaring at the floor like it was trying to make him cry on purpose.
~
I became aware the guy I was holding by the front of the shirt couldn’t technically be said to be fighting back at the moment. In fact, he couldn’t technically be said to be conscious and there was a question mark over whether or not he was actually technically still alive.
~
Teal’c said it in that mingled relief and irritation you feel when your finger’s been closing on the trigger a millisecond before you realize you’re about to shoot a friend.
~ Daniel turned and grinned in relief. I knew Teal’c was probably pretty much of a blur to him without his glasses, but he was obviously a big, familiar, comforting blur.
~
He was still fairly zoned. If he’d been asked to make a cup of coffee, for instance, he would almost certainly have put the mug in the trash and the filter paper in the cutlery drawer before ending up staring fixedly at the coffee beans wondering what the hell he was supposed to do with them, but as long as he only had to do one thing at a time, he could focus.
~
We’re actually pretty good at communicating by raised eyebrows and pointed looks by this stage in our friendship as he immediately proved by getting what I was saying and murmuring, “Oh,” in mild surprise.
~
General Hammond had given me very explicit instructions about Makepeace not being armed, but I have a personal code about taking someone into a situation where he stands a very good chance of getting his head shot off and not letting him carry a weapon. I pretended not to notice but hoped I wasn’t rewarded by being disintegrated sometime soon.
~
I tried to tell myself he was stopping halfway through a dangerous mission to admire the scenery only because he hadn’t slept in God knows how long and was probably a little concussed, but in my heart I knew he’d have been exactly the same even if in perfect health.
~
Daniel kept turning his head to take one last look at things I was hauling him away from while keeping up a little chorus of, “But, Jack…please…just a minute… would it hurt to…isn’t that a…that has to be a….” while I just kept saying, “No, Daniel. No. No, Daniel. No. No, Daniel…” I’ve found in the past one can use ‘Later’ or ‘Perhaps’ or ‘We’ll see’, but they’re never quite as effective as a constant stream of firm negatives backed up by a strong tug on the jacket or arm. Makepeace was looking at us like we were nuts while Teal’c wasn’t paying any attention whatsoever, which unfortunately gave the impression that we do this a lot, which was making Makepeace look at us like we were even more nuts
~
I shoved Daniel behind a cabinet thing and told him to keep his head down. He gave me one of his best ‘like I need to be told that’ looks before immediately putting his head up to get a better glimpse of some sword on the wall. I shoved him back on the rug and said, “Head down, Daniel.” By which time, Teal’c and Makepeace had zatted the hell out of everyone apparently without breaking into a sweat. When I turned around to see if Daniel was okay, he had his head up again and was squinting at that sword like it was a long-lost relative.
~
He was the sort who never crack until the very last second but when they do it’s like a nail bomb going off in a glass-blowing factory.
~
I looked to Teal’c, cocked a head in the direction of the TV screens, and asked a question with my eyebrows. He said, “Yes, O’Neill.”
See, that was actually giving me credit for being a few jumps further on than I was. Something all my team have a nasty habit of doing if I don’t pull them up on it. If I had a dollar for every time Carter’s said ‘I’m sure you can see where I’m going with this, sir…?’ when I have no idea…Well, I’m not saying I’d be wearing suits like Trevalyn’s but I’d be a damned sight richer than I am.
~
Civilians! A room full of weapons and he picks up the only one he doesn’t know how to work.
~
It landed with a clatter on top of all those other alien weapons proving there was life out there in the process of killing other life on billions of planets across countless dimensions.
~
“She’s dead. His idea actually, but I can’t say I was ideologically opposed to it.”
~
“I’m bored with being traumatized.”
~
“Everything they did to me was…”
“And I swear to God, Daniel, if you use the word ‘superficial’ in my hearing one more time I am going to get seriously irritated.”
~
“Crying by the orange juice for no reason is normal?”
“Well, with me it was always the pet food aisle, but the principal’s the same.”
~
“Don’t be happy about it, and please God don’t be impressed. It’s just a Special Forces tradition. Always learn to eat the food of the people you’re killing.”
~
“At this pace, we’ll walk right over it, Jack.”
“Good - then we’ll have found it.”
~
“Sealed up alive in a tomb, great,” he mumbled. “What does that say?” he said, looking over Daniel’s shoulder at the writing.
“Standard tomb kinds of things.”
~
He’d learned long ago that ‘I’m fine’ in Daniel’s vocabulary meant anything but fine. It could usually be translated as ‘get me to the infirmary, now’.
~
He took a sip with the air of a man who had no idea where coffee had materialized from, and was too grateful for its presence to stop and ponder the question.
~
God knew military protocol went out the window when SG-7 was in the middle of an experiment. They called their CO lots of things at Hour 49 of testing, and almost none of them involved his rank. His parentage and personal habits, yes; his rank, no.
~
Nothing moved, for which she was deeply grateful; it would be humiliating to break SG-1’s perfect ‘no permanent deaths’ record because the officer on watch had been giggling too hard to see any danger.
~
They’d listened to the sonorous, distorted voice with a mixture of shock and incredulity. The kind of ‘No way’ response elicited by the more distasteful entries in the Guinness Book of Records: some nutcase, say, who’d swallowed ten live goldfish and regurgitated them through his nostrils in fifteen seconds flat. Only more so.
~ Although clearly confused by the idea of a noisy old man in bizarre garb who rode through the air on a vehicle drawn by shrub-headed animals, the children latched on to the concept of presents quickly enough.
~
Okay, so the Thou shalt not bite thy prospective owner rule had been fairly obvious.
~
“Oh, and by the way, I told them you’re a healer, so if you feel like chanting to impress the natives, be my guest.”
She rolled her eyes. “Great, dad. Chanting definitely was the thing uppermost in my mind!”
~
“Blackmail, Dr Jackson”, Janet answered sunnily. “Blackmail.”
~ If there was such a thing as blancmange in planet form, this had to be it. It was warm, it was beige, and it was empty.
~
“How many what?”
“Dwarves with Snow White! ... Ribs, sir. Of the broken variety.”
~ They’d closed ranks around him, fiercely protective and remarkably unforthcoming with regard to the events of P3Y 444. That was, apart from announcing with flagrant glee that he’d thrashed the living daylights out of Heru’ur. In Janet’s book, this was such brilliant news that she was prepared to overlook the mysterious injury and forgive him for a grand total of three broken ribs.
~
“If he asks me to shoot you, I will do it first and questions later, though to be honest the only question I can think of is what’s taking him so long to give the order.”
~ They had been on this planet for days and the most excitement he’d seen was the dance Daniel did when the squirrel ran up his pant leg.
~
“Are you trying to get rid of me, Daniel?”
“Why would I want to do that, Jack? This is so much fun.”
“You really should learn to curb that sarcasm, Daniel. People might begin to believe that you really mean those things.”
“Well, we wouldn’t want that, so let’s be perfectly clear here. Go away, Jack.” 
“Never let it be said that I can’t take a hint.” 
~
“It will be okay. We’ve been in much tougher spots than this before. I mean look around. We’ve got a door, a window…dirt.”
~
“Besides. I’ve got a plan.”
“Well, what is it?” Jack couldn’t meet Daniel’s gaze and mumbled under his breath. “What was that, Jack? I couldn’t hear you.”
“I said, I was planning it.”
“You were planning the plan.”
~
“Climbing narrow wooden ladders in high heels isn’t my first choice of recreational activity…”

“You’re lying.” 
“That’s kind of insulting.” 
“Sorry.” 
“Liar.” 
My turn to grin. “Maybe it’s contagious.” 
~ He says that watching someone else’s disasters makes a nice change from living his own. Clearly Jack subscribes to the ‘I bang my head against a brick wall because it feels so good when I stop’ school of recreation. 
~
I went to check on Sam and let the others know that they could relax, everything was going to be all right, barring complications, pretended not to hear the question ‘what do you mean, complications?’, and advised them all to get some rest. 
~
“Bad news is that it’s going to take a minimum of three months of healing and physiotherapy to get you back to operational status. Four if you don’t stop swearing, Colonel.”
~ “On a scale of one to ten, just how pissed off are you, Colonel?” 
“Thirty seven,” said Jack, glowering. “And a half.” 
~
“You know, over the years I’ve collected quite a lot of handy little tips for survival. Tips like, ‘Don’t jump out of an aeroplane without a parachute’. ‘Don’t threaten to shoot someone holding a gun unless you’re sure you’ve got bullets in your gun’. ‘Don’t ever leave the house without lipstick’. ‘Don’t make Jack O’Neill mad, especially not at you’. That last one I consider particularly important.” 
~ Jack gave me a look that would easily have ignited rock.
~ Being attacked by Daniel is like getting savaged by a teddy bear. 
~
“What does the Colonel have to say?” 
The General’s smile was grim. “Nothing I’d care to repeat in mixed company.” 
~ God forbid I should ever make Jack O’Neill angry with me. The man could disembowel you with his tongue.
~ “Have you eaten? I’ve got beef and black bean sauce, mu shu pork, honey prawns, mixed vegetables and rice. And two sets of chopsticks.” 
“I burned two omelettes, ran out of eggs and gave up,” he said. “Come on in.” 
~ “But you’re okay. You’re a hero. Again. I was going to ask you to give me a hand unpacking all my stuff, but I guess you’re too important now to stoop to such menial --” 
“Janet,” said Sam, “does the sight of blood disturb you? Maybe you should avert your eyes ...” 
~ If stares were sounds, you’d have needed earplugs to avoid going deaf.
~ “Okay, we’ve got squiggle, squiggle-line, then squiggle-curve. So if our theory is right the next symbol should be the backwards squiggle.” 
“It’s upside down squiggle. Damn.” 
~ “Is there something wrong with the gravity now?” 
“Gravity’s fine. The floor, on the other hand, is at a ten degree tilt.” 
~ Yeah, they’d had a grand old time while he’d suffered under the yoke of oppression known as “triplicate.”
~
“I knew you couldn’t refuse a request from your son, especially when it had to do with the woman you...” 
“Work with,” Jack quickly supplied. 
“You have a great capacity for denial.” 
~ “Damn it, Carter! Do you think you could stop bleeding a little here? I don’t have that much gauze!”
~ Yes, Mr. Kent had been following the story as well. Yes, he’d been given an anonymous tip that had led them here. No, when she said “anonymous,” she did not mean she knew who it was. Yes, in fact she would like to be kept updated on Mr. Kent’s condition, thank you.
~ He was pulling a few hair samples and wondering if he could bum a needle off one of the junkies outside to take some blood.
~ She came back over, inspected him for any knives sticking out of his body or new gunshot wounds, then sat back down in her little chair.
~ “You been drinking again, Clark?”
“Anesthesia.”
“Good stuff.”
~
“Batman is taking the night off? Did she check to make sure he still has a pulse?”
John smirked. “Is there anything in here that’ll catch fire or blow up if we leave it?”
~ Weirdly, the threat lightened Wally’s heart a little. Shayera had to be feeling better overall if she was willing to punch people.
~ “Why did Wonder Woman just hit Batman on the back of the head?”
“Sign of affection,” said John. “In some cultures, smacking someone on the head is considered a mating ritual. And now we’re going to leave before Diana asks me to marry a chair.”
~
“Regular women accessorise with earrings and handbags. I spend ten minutes choosing between brands of stun grenade.” 
~
“He’s arrogant and argumentative and aggressive—and those are just the A’s.”
~ “I mean, nobody actually came right out and said the ‘L’ word, did they? On the other hand, preferring to die rather than lose her is a bit of a give away.”
~
Without realising it, she and Jack had drawn closer together, shoulders nearly touching, on their faces identical expressions of horror. It was quite sweet, actually, in a bizarre kind of way.
~
“Any sense of where we are?”
“How long have we been in here?”
“About half an hour.”
“Well, then we’re closer than we were half an hour ago.”
~
“He’s just not the type to come up with any coherent ideas.” That was the closest Dan had ever come to actually calling someone stupid. 
~
“What?  Us?  Worry?  What would ever give you that idea?”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Daniel told him.  “Could it be because you keep handing me weapons?”
~
“I did not mean to imply that we should have arrested and convicted them, O’Neill.  In my culture—”
“I know, Teal’c.  Dismember them.  I like it.  It’s a good plan.  Quick, subtle, to the point.  No room for misunderstandings there.”
~
“How do you feel?  You look terrible.”
“I feel terrible.  It’s a set.”
~ “Hey, pal, we’re scared to let you drive your own car.  I’ll get the dents on it myself if you don’t mind.”
“Is that a comment on my driving skills?”
“You have driving skills?”
~ “Face it, Jack. You could build an explosive from what you find in the kitchen in under a minute, but you can barely program your VCR.”
~
“Yeah sorry about that Carter, my master plan kept getting interrupted by those strange bouts of unconsciousness I seem to be prone to.”
~
“Please, do not be afraid, I will not harm you”
“Yeah right, we’ve heard that before...”
“Actually sir, normally they tell us straight away just how much they’re going to hurt us” 
~
Let Makepeace go in with his jarheads and I’ll go in with my people and we’ll see who lives the longest. Or we won’t, because Daniel will probably get himself captured ten minutes after we step through the gate after first having taken great care to put his sidearm down somewhere he can’t possibly get to it…
~ “Don’t do any more stuff like that. Ever. Hairy guys with clubs come near you – run away. Damsels in distress – just leave them where they lie. Do we put our only weapon down on the ground when we are in a potentially dangerous situation…?”
“I don’t actually know this one, but I’m guessing the answer you’re looking for here is…’no’?”
~
The negotiations had to take place in improvised sign language because the one person who could have made himself understood was lying trussed up in a corner with a gag in his mouth.
~ By his estimate, Dan had been a prisoner for four hours and thirteen minutes, which was exactly four hours and thirteen minutes too long.
~ He had held up someone he fervently hoped was a tax-collector and had taken the guy’s clothes and money.
~
“Jack, the fact that you don’t speak Ancient Sumerian is the only reason why I don’t have to arrange to have you killed.”
~
“I know it’s a hell of a risk to send Daniel to Egypt alone. That’s why I’ve just signed your vacation request.”
“Vacation request? Oh! Vacation. I hear Egypt is nice this time of year.”
“I thought you might have.”
~
“Gin! I make that $250,632 and 46 cents you owe me.”
“You know it wasn’t fair of Jack to tell you I’m no good at gin. Tomorrow we’re buying a chess set.”
“Fine by me,” Sam retorted. “I was college champion three years in a row!” 
~
“I’m a student of the arts, you know. For instance, this is a classic example of the 17th century.”
“Actually it’s early 19th.”
“I didn’t say I was a good student.”
~
Daniel knew that there were times in his life when, for all the PhDs he had, he indulged in moments of complete and utter madness.
~ “Since when did you become a left-handed marksman?” she asked gently.
Daniel gave a hollow laugh. “It went off on its own. You’re lucky I shot him, and not you.”
~
“He’s in custody on an alternative flight. General Hammond didn’t trust us…” He gave a tight smile as Sam raised her eyebrows. “OK - didn’t trust me with him. Don’t understand why - I only asked if the guy had ever tried free-fall.”
~
He was very aware of Carter appearing to be the only woman who existed in this place as anything other than a disembodied scream and his heart started to sink like an elevator going down. Then he noticed some big ugly hairy guy with a whole bunch of big ugly hairy friends looking Daniel over like he was the dessert tray, and the elevator became a cable car in free fall.
~
“The guard hit me because I hit him.”
“And you hit him because…?”
“I needed him to hit me back.”
~ And the fact they were all now alive instead of all now dead lent an extra bit of weight to Daniel’s argument that it had actually been rather a good plan. But he did wonder why it was all Daniel’s cunning plans always seemed to involve Daniel risking his neck or getting hurt.
~
He’d actually wanted the medicine for Daniel, but Daniel interpreted his request as the proof O’Neill was feverish and in pain and needed the dressing on his leg changed. By the time O’Neill had argued with him unsuccessfully on all those points, been forced to drink more Tok’ra glop, and then taught Daniel some brand new words as he was having his bandage changed, Daniel was looking a lot happier, as well as having had his vocabulary expanded, which, for a linguist, was probably always an extra bonus.
~ And why the hell were those little voices in your head never on your side?
~ “And are you going to be okay?”
“You already asked me that. Twice.”
“You didn’t answer me. Twice.”
~
“And since when has you being right ever made any difference to me? As if I let a little detail like that start influencing me.”
“Actually I was wrong once tonight,” Daniel said conversationally. “You’re a just stubborn unreasonable son-of-a-bitch all the time.”
~
Jack had threatened to throw his crutches at Daniel on the occasion when a particularly heated debate about why someone with an only half-healed burn on his right leg couldn’t drive himself to a hockey game had culminated in Daniel hiding the keys to Jack’s jeep. But although Jack had looked as though he meant it and Daniel had actually been getting ready to duck, Jack had settled for hopping angrily into the kitchen and opening and shutting all the drawers as loudly as possible to vent his frustration that way.
~
“I definitely think Daniel’s got a lot better at looking after himself over the last couple of years, sir.”
“Well he could hardly have got much worse, really, could he, Major?”
~
“He has worshippers on many worlds.”
“Yeah well, a judiciously placed hand grenade and he’s still chopped salami.”
~
Only after he’d made Daniel count fingers, name the last three presidents, and demanded that he said ‘No’, ‘Yes’ and ‘Death to the Goa’uld!’ in seven dead languages of his choice was Jack willing to pronounce him more or less fit.
~
“All the MREs – apart from the things you didn’t throw out from the last mission which have been evolving into new life forms in your pockets – are with the equipment, by the DHD, with the wailing worshippers. Eat the PowerBar.”
~
“Okay, listen up, because I’m just saying this the once. These are Bad People. They worship a Bad God. They do Bad Things. If you go near them, they will hurt you. Do not go anywhere near them. Don’t speak to them. In fact, don’t even look at them. Is that understood?”
“You know, Jack, you really ought to get some treatment for that paranoia.”
“Do we have any tranquillizer darts with us? Because right about now I’m thinking we should tranq either him or me before I do something I might regret.”
“Fine. I can take a hint. You don’t want me to talk to the locals. I’ll just go sit back down with Teal’c and admire the – uh – mist.”
~
“Did you know there’s a building up there? It seems to have smoke coming out of it.”
“Yeah, we know. It’s a ruin.”
“It doesn’t look ruined. It looks like it could still be in use.”
“Trust me on this, Daniel, it’s a ruin. We know, we ruined it. Well, actually, Teal’c ruined it. Either way it’s definitely ruined now.”
“Teal’c razed a whole temple?”
“Well, actually he more kind of lowered it.”
~
“Well, it’s not a very exact language, and these people are speaking a variant of it I don’t fully understand so I just told them you were a – a handsome friend, which is as close as I can get to saying you’re a good man given the limited vocabulary I have to work with.”
“‘Handsome friend’ is probably more accurate. I can live with that.”
~ He always thought of archaeology as careful digging with little implements and brushes, but he guessed that every now and then archaeology also involved hauling great big rocks around because Daniel was issuing orders about where to place the ropes, and how to pad the ropes and how to use that ceiling support as a pulley with surprising efficiency.
~ He opened his eyes and found Jack looking at him with that carefully neutral expression he always used to hide near-panic-stricken concern with apparent calm.
~ “I heard something hissing.”
“Yeah, that would have been all the blood in your brain going AWOL. Next time you hear that noise tell me before you fall over.”
~ “Actually, I’m a damned good cook, I just knew if I burnt enough packets of noodles you’d spring for take-out.”
~
“Six weeks at my place learning how to not just like hockey but answer long and difficult questions about it while being tested on your ability to tell imported beer brands apart in blind tastings will soon teach you the merits of taking much better care of yourself.”
~
“I was just wondering what you thought we should do next.”
“Wondering? Not suggesting?”
“Definitely just wondering.”
~
“We are here.” Harun’s voice was soft in the stillness.
“We’re halfway up a mountain in the middle of what looks suspiciously like nowhere to me.”
~
For instance, he’d never quite been able to work out why, when most deities were supposed to be benevolent and merciful, the people who worshipped them spent so much of their time torturing and killing each other.
~
“Striking Daniel will not help, O’Neill. Even harming Daniel severely will not persuade him to translate the tablet for you.”
Daniel murmured, “Um – probably better not to be put that idea in Jack’s head right now, Teal’c.”
Teal’c continued imperturbably, “And if Onuris’ Jaffa pursue us, our chances of escape would be much higher if we were all uninjured.”
Not even attempting to pretend he wasn’t hiding right now, Daniel nodded. “That’s a good argument, Teal’c, stick with that one.”
~
“I’m a what?” O’Neill looked up at the Jaffa and raised an eyebrow. “They have a word for a colonel in the United States Air Force?”
“No, O’Neill. But they have a word for the general of an army.”
“Oh. Promotion.” 
~
“If Daniel Jackson is not permitted to recover his strength, he may suffer permanent injury.”
“Yeah and if Onuris gets his hands on him, he’ll definitely suffer permanent injury and of the fatal kind.”
~
“So you’re saying, either we risk Daniel’s life waking him up and moving him, or we risk Daniel’s life spending the night in a place people might know we’re going to be staying in?”
~
Daniel couldn’t fight. It was an alien concept to him. If you punched him he just looked at you in bewilderment and wondered why you were doing it; it didn’t occur to him he could hit you back.
~
“You carried me all the way from those caves?”
“It was no burden,” Teal’c told her.
“That’s not what my bathroom scales tell me. I owe you one, Teal’c.”
~
O’Neill hadn’t seen so much eye make-up since he’d spent four hours waiting for a defector in a drag club in West Berlin.
~
O’Neill was tuning him in an out like a radio station he only half wanted to listen to; checking back every now and then to ensure Daniel was still talking and therefore still breathing and not being stripped clean by piranhas, suffocated by an anaconda or eaten by a jaguar, but basically leaving him alone while he was – if not quiet – at least reasonably contented.
~ “I wonder what it was running from?”
“Hands up who doesn’t want to hang around here to find out?” Daniel’s hand shot into the air with the speed of a born teacher’s pet and despite the throbbing in his leg, O’Neill couldn’t repress a smile. “Okay, Daniel: let’s strategically withdraw the hell away from here…”
~ “But it’s never occurred to you to wonder why we all do what you say?”
“Oh yeah, nothing warms my heart faster than when I say ‘Daniel, we’re leaving’ and you say, ‘In a minute, Jack, I just have to look at these squiggles first.’”
~
“This from the man who keeps telling me he’ll kill me if I don’t shut up?”
“Now, be fair, I’ve been very careful to use the word ‘maim’. Death was never an option.”
~
“One of these things has to be working.”
Daniel frowned. “Why?”
The look Jack shot him over his shoulder was full of impatience. “Because we need one.”
“Oh right, what was I thinking? O’Neill’s Law clearly states that anything essential for a particular plan to work must inevitably become available within the necessary timeframe.”
~
“Can you fly one of these?”
“I’m a colonel in the United States Air Force, Daniel. We can fly anything.”
“No, but really, can you fly it? Has Teal’c shown you what the instrument panel thingamajig does? Has he…?”
“A little faith if you don’t mind, Daniel. Teal’c isn’t the only guy on SG-1 who can wing it with Goa’uld technology.”
Daniel looked at him for a moment. “Yes, he is.”
~
…except for some near fatal contacts with the tops of tall trees as that damned glider looped loops he’d never told it too.
~ Medical students practiced their surgery on cadavers and Black Ops teams practiced their surgery on each other.
~
“No one does this to my team and gets away with it. Onuris is dead, if I have anything to say about it.”
Daniel found him a glimmer of a smile from somewhere. “Wonder if that’s in the prophecy?”
“Well, just as long as the next sentence is ‘And lo, verily it came to pass’ they can go right ahead and quote me.”
~
“But they can’t use them unless they switch off their personal shields. I get Onuris in the hand with this and – “
“And then Mehit blasts you across the temple with her hand device. No, wait. I get the rest of the plan: As she lowers her defence shield, I jump her, grabbing her wrist, then she throws me into the nearest pillar, and then she blasts you across the temple with her hand device.”
~
No one was listening to him. He might be cunning as the wolf that hunted in winter and right hand man to their Deliverer but he was also a guy saying things they really didn’t want to hear in a language they didn’t understand.
~
“I serve the one true god, Onuris. Were you he you would cast the unbelievers down. The god I serve needs no help from me.”
“I am Onuris!”
“Then you have no need of my assistance.” 
~
“I was dreaming about waffles again.”
“That’s nice. In the meantime, they’re about to get torn limb from limb by the outraged multitudes because one of their Jaffa killed you.”
~
“Carter has a big mouth.”
“Sam has this strange idea I’m an adult who might function more efficiently if he’s given all available data. Must be the scientist in her.”
~
“You’re a civilian. You don’t know anything.”
“Know more than you do.”
“Don’t.”
“Do.”
“Don’t.”
“Do too.”
“I see the level of debate is as elevated as ever in here. Teal’c and Sam are discussing wormhole physics in their room.”
~
“Some people do actually find one of the most fascinating astrophysical phenomenon in the universe quite interesting, Colonel.”
“Some people learn Klingon or change their name to ‘James T Kirk’. And then there’s the people who have a life…”
~
Then Fraiser would first ask them what they wanted for lunch as though there was some possibility they might get it. They’d tell her what they wanted. She’d tell them what they were having. The two never corresponded in any way.
~
He raised his eyes to the ceiling and wondered what the hell was keeping it up. Didn’t people get struck by lightning at least for telling those kinds of lies?
~
“Fraiser said I could go home tomorrow as long as there’s someone with me to stop me doing anything that might be remotely enjoyable.”
~
“I am going to be the patient from hell, and if I hurt myself while in your care Doc Fraiser’s going to be all over you like the wrath of God. After all the times she’s been after me for letting you get lost, damaged or stolen, that is going to be so satisfying.”
~
“All right. But it still isn’t fair.”
“That’s exactly what Colonel O’Neill said.”
“On occasion life is not fair.” 
“And that’s pretty much what Daniel said.”
Teal’c cast an enquiring glance at her. “And O’Neill’s response to that was…?”
“Not suitable for your ears, Teal’c,” Doctor Frasier assured him cheerfully.
~
“…okay to spend two days limping through a freakin’ jungle but I can’t walk to the commissary…!”
“It’s because you spent two days limping through the jungle that Janet doesn’t want you walking on it now.”
“And if my knees seize up from lack of use…”
“The rest of us will be sure to hear all about it…”
~
“Please tell me you’re not going to whine if they don’t have any Fruit Loops?”
“Oh like you never bitch about it when they run out of waffles.”
~
“Oh I bet you had the nicest ward too, with pictures on the walls, and fluffy towels, just because Fraiser likes you better than she likes me.”
“As far as I am aware, O’Neill, this preference is not limited to Doctor Fraiser. In fact I would say it was unanimous throughout the SGC.”
~ “We’re racing Carter and Teal’c to the commissary.”
Daniel Jackson blinked at him in confusion. “Why?”
“My question exactly,” Major Carter put in.
“Because it’s fun. And you are so buying the pizza come Friday night.”
Major Carter bristled defensively. “With the greatest respect, sir. You may as well just give us the money right now.”
“Oh, cocky. I resent that on Daniel’s behalf,” O’Neill returned defiantly.
“Why? Teal’c’s stronger than me, Sam’s lighter than you…”
“Daniel!” O’Neill held up a warning finger. “We’re going to win.”
“This is stupid.”
O’Neill twisted his head round to look up at him in exasperation. “Didn’t you ever take on stupid bets when you were at school?”
Daniel Jackson’s evident bewilderment proved the truth of his reply. “No.”
“Well it’s high time you did then.” He glanced back at Teal’c. “On three.”
~
The wheelchair was surprisingly difficult to steer, and Teal’c found it veered from side to side as he pushed it. Major Carter felt very light to him, but the axels of the wheels were badly designed and it would have been deemed utterly unacceptable as a means of transportation by any Goa’uld. Indeed the designer of such a device would undoubtedly have been ordered thrown to wild dogs by any self-respecting System Lord. As would the designers of all supermarket carts Teal’c had as yet encountered.
~
“That looked like a nasty fall, Colonel. Shall I send for Doctor Fraiser?”
“No!” O’Neill and Daniel Jackson both protested in unison.
“Jack’s fine, sir, really.” Daniel Jackson propped O’Neill against the wall, set the wheelchair back on its wheels, and quickly flipped down the bent-looking foot rests, making hasty hand motions to O’Neill to get into it. O’Neill was back in the wheelchair in an instant with his feet on the rests, swiftly belting up his robe. “Like Daniel said, I’m fine, sir, really. Never better.”
“All the same, Colonel O’Neill, I think perhaps I ought to inform Doctor…”
“Please, General.” Daniel Jackson gripped the handles tightly. “Janet’s scary when you don’t do what she says.”
“Perhaps just one of the many good reasons for doing what she says, Doctor Jackson?”
Major Carter said quickly. “Sir, we’re sorry. We’ve just been cooped up in those isolation wards for so many days…”
“And there wasn’t even anything wrong with Jack and me…”
“Even I, General Hammond, have found the period of convalescence trying to the patience…”
“And it is a full moon.” As they all turned to gaze at O’Neill in disbelief, he looked back at them defiantly. “Hey, it’s a reason.”
~
“And how come Carter doesn’t have to write a report?”
“I have already informed General Hammond of what occurred and he is aware that Major Carter was unwell for much of the mission.”
“Well I had a hole in my leg for half the damned mission. I still have to write a report.”
“Sam was delirious or unconscious for most of the time we were on the planet. You’re just pissy because we lost the race.”
“We didn’t lose the race,” O’Neill bristled at once.
“Yes, we did. Teal’c would have won easily.”
“Ah yes, ‘would’ being the operative word, because we’ll never know, because the race was never finished .”
~
You never even realized how many rules you’d been unconsciously abiding by until suddenly you could break them.
~
“That was always what this was about, wasn’t it? You were always setting me up for this.”
“Face it, O’Neill, you are way out of your league here. Didn’t I ever tell you? People killed to get me on their debating teams in college.”
~
“What number is the History Channel?”
“I have no idea, and it doesn’t matter because we’re going to be watching ESPN.” He said it with great emphasis in the hope that might make it more likely to happen.
~
“Oh is that Rita Hayworth?” Daniel peered at the screen curiously. “I thought she had red hair. That woman looks blonde.”
“That is red hair.” O’Neill stabbed a finger at the screen. “That is glorious red hair. Can’t you see that?”
“Jack, it’s a black and white film.”
“Not remotely relevant. What colour dress is she wearing?”
Daniel gave him a sideways look. “Um…grey?”
“It’s blue. That’s the trouble with people of your generation. Never learned to identify the different shades of grey.”
~
Daniel munched his way through another cookie, tucking his sock-covered feet underneath him in that boneless way the young had, and which O’Neill could only envy these days. Did they all do yoga or something? How the hell did they get their knees to bend like that?
~ He wordlessly held his empty mug out to him without removing his gaze from the screen. “Is this your subtle way of asking for a refill?”
“Sssh,” Daniel waved a hand at him in a clear ‘go away and get me more coffee’ motion.
~
“You know there are no documented cases of anyone lapsing into a coffee withdrawal coma, Daniel. It really is okay to have a little blood left in your caffeine stream.”
“Unless you have that in writing from Janet, I don’t believe you, and you’re missing a really good scene.”
“Well those of us who didn’t spend our formative years digging up mummies in places with no electricity have actually seen this movie a couple of times before…”
~
“Daniel? Daniel! You still there?” 
“Jack, you asked me that two minutes ago. How am I supposed to concentrate on this inscription if you keep interrupting me?” 
“Well, don’t wander off. And don’t – touch anything.” 
“Well, can I touch the video-camera? Because it might be a little difficult for me to film these inscriptions if I can’t.” 
~
I can think of a dozen different reasons off the top of my head why she might want to grab him and at the moment ‘food’ is the least scary.
~
“Wonderful: primordial soup with an undercurrent of impending cataclysm.”
~
“Okay, let’s negotiate shall we? You let Daniel go and I won’t turn you into a sieve. How does that sound?”
~ Archaeologist tossing had never been an Olympic event that O’Neill was aware of, but as the impact of Daniel crashing into him sent them both spinning over the edge, he realized that if it was ever introduced the Unas would be a dead cert for the gold medal.
~
Sam swore there were six different MRE flavours, she might even have said seven, but he only ever seemed to get macaroni and cheese or chicken with salsa and as they both tasted exactly the same he was never sure which was which.
~ He probably would get pneumonia. Which suited him fine. That would thwart Apophis very nicely.
~
With any luck Jack would still be kicking his heels in some holding cell in heaven, demanding to see the management because he’d already been to hell once and he was damned sure he wasn’t going there again, and if he didn’t have a reservation they’d damned well better recheck their bookings…
~
“The Unas eat them. Roasted symbiote head is apparently an Unas delicacy. I should have taken a bite of the one I was offered when I had the chance but it did look truly disgusting.” That was when they’d all started digging food out of their vests for him. 
~
“We got sent to hell? What did we do?”
~
“You might not know you’re dead. Ghosts don’t apparently. You were coming to rescue me so you might have just kept coming. That would be very like you.”
~
“As soon as I’ve checked you out for any damage you might have sustained in transit. I’m not convinced that Unas read the manual right on the proper care and transportation of archaeologists.” 
“Well if he did, it was the same one Apophis’s serpent guards all have a copy of.” 
~ “Fraiser really earns her money with you, doesn’t she? As a patient, you’re a pain in the ass.” 
“Well as a doctor, you…” Daniel looked down at his bandaged ribs. “Well, okay you’re not that bad.” 
~
“‘You know if anyone had told me that you just got more annoying with longer acquaintance I never would have believed it.” 
“Well if anyone had told me that after all the times I have been so damned right and you have been so damned wrong that you still wouldn’t ever listen to anything I have to say, I wouldn’t have believed that.” 
~
“I’m sorry you can’t save me from everything. But it isn’t my fault that we’re both human and you’re not Superman.” 
There was a long pause before O’Neill answered. “Who told you I wasn’t Superman?” 
Daniel looked up at him warily. “I went through your locker when you were on Edora, Jack. There was no costume.” 
“I could keep it at home. You know there’s a telephone box just over the street.” 
~
“Daniel, don’t even try to use a sports analogy against me, okay? You have no idea what you’re talking about and we both know it.” 
~ “Yeah, right. ‘Fine’ in the ‘has double pneumonia, pleurisy, and quite possibly a fractured skull’ sense?”

“Are you arguing with me, Daniel?” 
“No.” Daniel said it in the tone more usually accompanied by a ‘yes’. “I’m just saying that I’m actually probably in better shape than…” 
“Sounds like arguing to me. In fact it sounds like rank insubordination deserving the cessation of all chocolate rations until further notice.” 
~
“Where’s everyone? I’m sure I left instructions that my team had to cluster anxiously around my bedside whenever it was appropriate.”
~ “I was dreaming I wanted to…kill myself. I think you…stopped me.” 
“How?” Jack was gazing at him with peculiar intensity. “You know, just in case I ever need it for future reference?” 
~
“Janet, why not just let him watch them in here?”
“I made that mistake once. Daniel talks to himself, and argues with the narrator if there is one. Quite disturbing for the staff.”
~
“Sir, that’s a large hotel. The odds of anyone seeing them...” He let his words die off at the expression on Hammond’s face. “...are very good. Very good indeed.”
~
“And where are you going, if I may ask?” 
“I think you already know our base destination, Colonel. The Middle East.” 
“Care to narrow it down a little?” 
“Let’s just say that the area in question is not overly fond of Americans.” 
“That description covers about a third of the civilized world, and at least half of the rest.”
~ “Damn it Carter. You can get killed like that.” 
“No, sir. I knew who had the gun.” 
“That was a compliment to my shooting skills, wasn’t it, Major?”
~
“Reports from inside indicate a total of twelve people so far, including Mr. Potty Mouth here. Keep it civil, asshole, there’re ladies present.”
~ “What do we tell O’Neill?” 
“The truth. That we lost him. I’ll tell him when I return Dr. Jackson’s journals.” 
“Want company?” 
Benjamin smiled grimly. “No thanks. Why should both of us die?”
~ “Oh, the pretty blue... nightmare that would’ve looked nice on someone, not you, of course, say five hundred years ago?”
~ “She’s still mad?” 
“From the amount of chocolate ice cream in that bowl, I’d say that could be the understatement of the century.”
~ “Peterson in maintenance says the paint takes about six weeks to fade off of skin. But don’t worry. Bently in research is trying to formulate a solvent that won’t take your skin off.”
~
“Haven’t seen them in about seven hundred verses of Ninety Nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall…”
~
“I’m not worried,” quipped Jack. “Teal’c, a death glider, single opponent...” 
“And no ammunition,” Sam murmured.”
“Good thing, or it’d be raining jets in California about now.”
~
“Carter, how much did you give him, for Christ sake? He’s got all the coordination of overcooked spaghetti.”
~
“Okay, if the Colonel is a ‘what’, I’m a ‘what-if’, and you’re a ‘what-for’... then what’s Teal’c?”
“I am a Jaffa.”
~
“A talk with Daniel and Teal’c about stuff. A talk with Carter about the physics of the whole time travel deal. A trip to Doctor Fraiser to get an aspirin to relieve the headache I got after listening to Carter.”
“Your conclusion, colonel?”
“That Carter is way smarter than me, Daniel drinks far too much coffee and I should never play poker with Teal’c.”
“About the mission.” His expression serious, Hammond kept his head up, ready to face criticism.
“You did the right thing.”
~
“Next downtime we get, there’s a fishing pole in Minnesota with your name on it.”
“More like a swarm of mosquitoes.”
~ “I’d really like to get there in one piece. Un-dented. Un-drowned. I’ve given up on un-traumatized.”
~
“I know the drill. Usually I work with shipwrecks, not lost civilizations, but the principle’s the same.”
~
Freezing, I made a tactical assessment of the situation and proceeded with the most strategic course of action under the circumstances – I yelled bloody murder at the top of my lungs.
~
Why is it that I can’t get a subcontractor to lay bathroom tile in a straight line, but every Tom, Dick, and Apophis seems to have slaves that can build Fort-Knox-like temples with precision and ease?
~
“Are we all here?”
“Yes, perfectly.”
“No, not can we all hear…”
~
“In my case it’s more a case of ‘red sky at night, thatched cottage on fire at the end of the village.’”
~
“I’d like our church to be a church, not a large, church-shaped begging bowl.”
~
She looked like she was going to insist he do what any reasonable man who has just returned from the dead should do and lie down.
~ For a man who was supposed to be resting, Daniel was doing an awfully good impression of a man getting dressed in a hurry.
~ “One of the joys of the job,” he said. “Janet’s probing pokes and prods.” 
“I heard that,” Janet said. 
“Of course you did,” the Colonel said. He leaned towards Jane. “Ears like a dog,” he whispered. 
“I heard that, too,” Janet said. 
“See!” 
~
“You doing anything?”
“Right this very moment or as in today or in the sense of some abstract future?”
~ “God, it’s like being shot.”
“You know, you have never actually been shot before, you really have no basis for comparison.”
~
“Since I know you don’t want to get blood on my uniform I think it’s okay for me to tell you that you’re funny when you have to be girly.”
~ “Daniel,” Jack ground out lowly, more a warning than an address, and Daniel blinked, checked his watch, and then, with as much dignity as a multiple doctorate could muster, scurried away.
~ “First of all it’s hot, it’s halfway across the planet, and did I mention hot? Miserable, scorching, ‘you’ve got to be kidding’ hot.”
~
“I was saddened to hear you and your team-mates had been killed; I am pleased to discover that was an error.”
~ My face sported a new scar, running down the length of my cheek. I couldn’t decide if it made me look sexy, rakish, or sinister. From the expression on the face of the young girl at the register of my local store, I’d go with sinister.
~
Maybe we should develop some codes for use on unsecured phone lines. I could make a list: My car won’t start = The Supreme Commander of the Asgard fleet has been shot by a vengeful woman and is lying on my floor. I’m doing the grocery shopping = Help! I’ve been kidnapped by aliens with snakes in their heads. I’m taking the dog for a walk = Please bring a cell, Thor needs to phone home. I have to wash my hair = I’m not dead this time, just sleeping. Please wake me in thirty minutes. (To be used by General O’Neill only)
~
When he rolled in at two am accompanied by two girls that my Aunt Beatrice would have called hussies, I was very restrained as well. I didn’t kill him. Apparently he had thoughtfully provided a girl for me too. Nice of him. The fact that they were all of twenty, with skirts short enough to show their navels sort of put me off. Funny that.
~
“How many fingers?” 
“Hammond, George, Lieutenant. 1920492.”
“I don’t think the Geneva convention was intended to apply to answering legitimate medical questions.” 
~
Sock for sale. Bottle green. Would suit person with similar sock.
~
“All you have to do is create the right social situation and love will flower like a flower… flowering in the right social situations.”
~
“I’m not a lunatic and I have the psychiatric evaluations to prove it.”
~
“Greetings my people. It is with a glad heart that I see you have responded to my call as I bring to you new visitors.” The governor paced forward, addressing the gathering, and Daniel schooled his face into polite attentiveness.
“Look everyone at what followed me home THIS time.” Jack abruptly sotto voiced, impromptu translating.
“Look upon them now and know them all.”
“If you’re missing any silverware when all this is done, these are the guys to go after.” Jack continued on gleefully murmuring.
“They have come through the great stone ring in the valley, an ancient obelisk which needs be regarded no longer as an outdated relic but rather as a device to travel from afar.”
“You know that thing we used to play basketball with, guess what...it ain’t for just making hoops anymore.”
“And as they are strangers their customs are not our own. Therefore, I ask that you respect their alien ways and do not take offense during their visit as they have not had the time to establish themselves and regard our customs as the last men of the Tau’ri did.”
“This batch isn’t really housebroken or anything so don’t expect much.”
“In their time here, we hope to establish agreements of trade. For services and goods, much needed by the people.”
“We’re going to liquor them up and see what we can roll them for.”
“Therefore, we now adjourn to the Selectoriam where we will feast and share the cup of alliance making.”
“Soup’s on!”
~
“My point is, when did you eat last?”
“This morning?”
“Coffee doesn’t count.”
“Last night.”
“Neither do Oreo cookies.” Daniel opened his mouth to reply, only to have Jack hold up a warning hand, “It doesn’t count if it came from a vending machine, from Sam’s stash of chocolate, from Fraiser’s secret Yoo-hoo cache or from anything they serve in the infirmary since none of that counts as real food. So setting those aside what was the last thing you ate.”
~
“Why are there always mines?” He addressed everyone and no one at once. “Did you ever notice that? Every time something like this happens, we’re sent to the mines.”
~
“Oh, she’s fine. She gets moody when she’s drunk. But I’m sure you know that.” He paused with a crease in his forehead. “Or maybe you don’t. If I had a sister I’m not sure I’d want to know what she was like when she was drunk.”
~
“You don’t mind, do you?”
“If I said I did, would it stop you?”
Jack grinned at her. “Only until you fall asleep.”
~
“Sweet little Sammy is an astrophysicist and, yes, they will need me.”
“Is that confidence or arrogance?”
“It’s more of a psychic thing.” She grinned hard and then tried to look innocent. “I might have booby-trapped a few things in my lab.”
~
“He just wanted me to know that he had every intention of marrying me just as soon as I thought was appropriate and that it was very important that he ask before someone realized his transfer orders were a mistake and made him my CO again. I told him I like platinum settings and that my ring finger is a size five.”
~ “Yeah, Jack, you... I mean, just take things slow... wait a while... don’t do anything crazy like run off and get married right away or anything like...” Hammond trailed off, looking at the two officers he knew so well very carefully. They had their ‘No, of course we’re not leaving anything out of our reports, General’ faces on. The ones he had seen far too many times over the years, after things like time dilations, memory stamps, alien viruses… “You did it already, didn’t you.” he stated.
~ “I don’t think I’d make a good vampire,” he objected, “I don’t even like my steaks rare.”
“What is a vampire?”
“Senator Kinsey.” “A bloodsucking monster,” Daniel explained at the same time.
“Exactly,” Jack smirked, “Isn’t that what I just said?”
~ “Apparently the me that’s here managed to persuade the alternate Hammond that we’d upset the space time continuum if we stayed here so they’re chucking us back through the Stargate like those little fish you’re supposed to…you know, throw back in the water.”
“Kind of lost your metaphor there, didn’t you, Dr Jackson?”
“Simile, Jack. And I don’t know anything about fishing.”
“Remind me to teach you.”
Daniel shook his head. “I have pet fish, remember? How could I look them in the eye if I went off and did hook and line type things.”
~ “How many fingers am I holding up, Jack?”
I stalled. “Daniel, you don’t have your glasses on, which means you probably don’t know how many fingers you’re holding up.”
~
“…He only hit me once but Jack got really pounded.”
“Thank you, Daniel. That reinforces my authority wonderfully.”
~
“The point is, you helped me. And I still refused to listen to you even after I’d gone to the trouble of hallucinating you in the first place…”
“Wait. You were hallucinating me? McKay, so help me if I was naked…”
“No, no, fully clothed,” McKay said quickly. “At first at least.”
“Should I be concerned that Atlantis’s lead scientist is having hallucinations?”
“No, no. They were a one-time thing, I assure you. Hopefully. And I knew I was hallucinating the whole time, so that’s a clear indication that I’m not really crazy. After all, crazy people don’t know they’re crazy, right?”
~ “Still. If I have to hear Daniel make one more stupid, long-winded speech about the meaning of life, I’ll…I’ll shrink his costume tights.”
“Go ahead. I think that might earn you the undying gratitude of every girl attending this thing.”
~ “Besides, Teal’c and I will make sure Daniel is tucked in his own bed before midnight. I’ll personally read him a story. Goldilocks?” 
Daniel managed a wan caricature of the smirk. “I’d prefer Jack and the Beanstalk.”
“Maybe Cinderella? I hear it’s a real ball,” Jack grinned.
~
“She probably thought the three of you would scare him off.”
“If he is so easily frightened he is not worthy of her affections.”
~ “Alright, look – would everyone please stop jumping over the bottomless pit!”
~ “He turned you into a three-year-old.”
Carter’s eyes widened slightly. “That must have been an interesting experience.”
Teal’c nodded. “You were what I believe is called a holy living terror.”
~
Studies show that research causes cancer in lab rats.
~
“Well it’s supposed to be a telescope, but you have to put it together and I think the parts are reproducing.”
~
“I’ve found that sticking your fingers in your ears and humming loudly solves a whole slew of problems.”
~ It didn’t hurt that she had blond hair, blue eyes, and that the day after try-outs one of the bigger jocks had tried to grab her in the hallway and had promptly gotten a full-power backhanded fist to the face.
~ Colorado Springs was a military town. Those who were not military themselves were either dating it, married to it, or lived next door to it.
~ Jon was panicking. Alex was panicking. Daniel had zipped right past panic and gone straight for traumatized.
~
“Asking Carter to try harder is like asking a bomb to blow up. It’s redundant. And stupid. You do not want to be at ground zero when Carter runs out of reasonable options.”
~
Willis was discovering muscles he’d never suspected existed. And he wished he’d never found them, since their chosen method of making themselves known was through pain.
~
“Will the authorities permit us to utilize homemade explosives?” Will asked curiously.
Daniel coughed and muttered something about the FBI and blowing up that bridge when they came to it.
~
Alex popped out of one of the trucks, a maniacal expression of glee on her face. Out of habit, Jon began to sweat nervously. He knew that look. It was the one that said, ‘I’d like to blow up a sun, now. You have thirty seconds to say yes.’
~ “But it’s brought you to the point where you’re just about ready to hand Sam over to a man that I wouldn’t hesitate to call a pissant dickwad were I inclined to label people as such.”
~
“I’m surprised to see you out of the mountain.”
“I’m surprised to see you at all,” Jack said. “Don’t you guys have invisibility cloaks or something?” 
~
“You two are scary,” said Daniel Jackson as he came up to them. “And you worry me.”
Jack glanced at Sam who was smiling. “And you realise this now, Dr. Jackson?”
“In the archaeological world, it can take years of study to discover the meaning in otherwise random bits of information,” Daniel began with mock-solemnity. “Conclusions are often complex and multi-layered—”
~
“This wasn’t me, Jack. I’ll swear it by any god you want.”
~
She had never realized just how much she had picked up over the years. He had been content to be paranoid enough for all of them until he and Teal’c almost died aboard the X-301. Suddenly the two of them were chasing the other half of SG1 across hill and dale like a pair of demented weasels. Sneaky, merciless, paranoid and particularly nasty weasels.
~
“You operational, Carter?”
“Not if you expect me to shoot anything,” she replied bluntly. “Or walk,” she added honestly. “Or blow anything up. Saving the world from the forces of darkness would be difficult too, Sir,” she admitted.
~
“Death is such a temporary condition these days. As for the bodies, you’ll have to ask the Tok’ra about that one. I don’t really know the details. I was sort of not among the living when it was all being arranged.”
~ The crew onboard tended to avoid her side of the ship. She compromised by not telling them that if the shielding around the cores failed, it wouldn’t matter where they were standing.
~ Teal’c had said it meant fated. Daniel had been more forthcoming and admitted it meant doomed
~ She snapped her head toward him, her hands automatically coming to rest on her P-90. He studied those hands for a moment, caught by the fact that she had reacted reflexively to the tension in his voice first, then only second to her knowledge that she was safely ensconced in the Gateroom of the SGC, surrounded by half a dozen armed soldiers and three Tok’ra.
~ "See, at some point earlier in my life, I’d read ‘The Inferno’, and I was fairly certain that it had never mentioned anything about the periodic table being the seventh circle of hell. It seemed like Dante could have at least put in a foot-note to warn the unsuspecting students.
~ The hormonal teenage-boy side of me was screaming ‘cat-fight’! The grown-up, military side of me was placing odds that Angel could knock Carrie out with one punch… it was also screaming cat-fight.
~
“Someone followed me here.” I blurted out before Jack could get his hands around my neck. He stopped, looking torn between curiosity and murderous rage. And luckily for me, it wasn’t a lie.
~ Having had up close and personal experience with the alien technology that could cast a tangible hologram, it was a wonder that I wasn’t paranoid about anyone who came within ten feet of my person.
~ Looking back on it in retrospect, I probably shouldn’t have hit the lady. The way my mother had raised me the ‘always play nice with the girls’ side had a problem with it when I bloodied her nose, but my military side was thinking ‘you should have hit her harder, ya pansy-ass.’ I was inclined to go with the military side.
~ Storage closets at the SGC were, in their own way, as important as the ‘Gate itself. For example, the large closet on level 19 was used for housing spare medical supplies, which was fitting, considering that Felger’s lab resided down the hall. The tiny alcove on level 20 housed all of Siler’s various wrenches—he had quite the collection, after all. There was a general supply closet on level 17 that had seen more than its share of illicit sexual liaisons, due to its convenient distance from any security camera. And then, of course, there was the closet on level 15 that was actually a trans-dimensional vortex to a pocket reality.
~ “It’s you,” he observed, sounding as delighted as a man who was mostly asleep could manage.
~
“I had two socks when I put this load in the dryer! Two nice, matching socks. Now, I have one white sock and one navy sock. How can you go from two matching grey socks to a navy sock and a white sock?”
~ “You did this on purpose, didn’t you?” she exclaimed, wondering why it hadn’t occurred to her before.
Wide brown eyes looked back at her guilelessly. “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Laughter escaped her before she could even think about curbing it, and his eyes narrowed. “Stop giggling—you’ll tip everyone else off!”
Sobering, she took another bite of the as of yet unidentified meat on her plate. “Somehow, I think they’ve already figured it out.”
He waved his hand vaguely. “Nonsense. It is a brilliant strategic manoeuvre and is now being flawlessly executed.”
“…You haven’t said a word to anyone but the four of us.”
“Exactly. It’s working out perfectly. They are free to entertain themselves while we enjoy ourselves. Everyone can be happy.”
“Then why is Lady Travell glaring in this direction?” she pointed out.
“After careful consideration, I’ve decided that she’s simply physically incapable of smiling.”
~
Though he had yet to figure out why, after dinner, people had adjourned to yet another room he hadn’t realized he had and begun singing and playing an instrument he hadn’t realized he owned.
~
“Private, if someone could access this information, then they probably overwrote the audit trail as they did so.”
“That’s a possibility, sir, but I doubt they could overwrite all three.”
“Three?”
“Yes, Sir. This is a government operation, everything gets done in triplicate.”
~
“You know perfectly well I was under the impression I was taping a game. Imagine my surprise when- what did I actually get, Daniel?” 
A small voice, addressed to a spot somewhere over Jack’s left shoulder, confessed, “The migration of flamingos across the salt flats of Namibia. You did get to see quite a lot of the game. I hadn’t accidentally taped over the whole thing! You enjoyed the documentary.” 
Jack hooted, “I did not. I amiably tolerated it for your sake. Once the shock had worn off, and I’d broken out my Glen Livet. Then the Glenmorangie. Then the Glen Farclas - covered more Glens in two hours than a map of Scotland.” 
“It was dramatic footage. That little flamingo, with the salt crust round it’s foot, falling farther and farther behind - you were mesmerised.” 
“I was paralysed with boredom.” Jack said firmly. 
“You did a fist pump when the film crew went back and saved the little flamingo. I distinctly remember that. It being after the end credits and all.” 
That was, regrettably, true. Jack said defiantly, “I was stoned on cooking sherry by that point, out of sheer desperation.” 
Daniel gave him a sad little shake of the head and murmured gently, “You’ve still got the tape, Jack.”
~
“I’m twenty-one…unless it’s relevant.”
~ “I never touched him.” 
“You didn’t have to. You just loomed. In an unmistakeably and increasingly menacing manner.”
“I allowed my body language to imply a threat I was more than willing and able to make good if anybody wanted to take the discussion outside. Which they didn’t.”
“He enjoyed himself hugely, ruthlessly intimidating an entire room full of archaeologists. Got more and more outrageous as the night wore on. It was primal. They were smart enough to recognise an apex predator when they saw one. Especially once Jack decided we needed to circulate. After a few preliminary skirmishes, my esteemed colleagues in the Society for Archaeological Sciences tried to flock together for safety, then scattered whenever they saw Jack swooping down on them, picking off the strays.” 
“The terminally unsuspecting or downright aggressive. Culled from the flock.” Jack’s smile was wolfish. “Survival of the fittest and all that. Very scientific.” 
“He kept making provocative comments like, “Oh yes, I thought that was an excellent point when Dr Jackson first made it, three years ago.” 
“Had you?” 
“Not in that case, no. But he said it with such superb conviction …Then I made a fatal error and showed him my invitation to the AGM of the Society. It’s normally just a standard circular but mine had a memo attached, stating any military escort would be deemed acceptable, except Colonel O’Neill. They mentioned him by name, three times, in as many paragraphs. He sulked for days when I refused to attend.” 
~
Jack was still whining about having the aisle seat. “Your arm gets knocked by every goomba passing by.” 
Daniel eyed him thoughtfully. “You’re right. It was very thoughtless of me to obediently sit in the exact seat you picked out for me, after rejecting three other rows in which I was perfectly comfortable. I’m still not buying that line about explosive decompression.”
~
“My pleasure. That’s what friends are for. And just in case you feel compelled to share a single, solitary detail about this weekend with the world, you should know - I’ve got an MP5 and a shovel. I doubt anyone would miss you.”
~ “It is a tricky one isn’t it. You know if I didn’t know better I’d say that that symbol there was ‘rice’ but in this context that wouldn’t make any sense.” His finger backtracked across the page. “Beware the rice?”
“That’s the conclusion I came to. It doesn’t make any sense. Unless of course the next paragraph is going to warn about killer tomatoes.”
~ “As you have no doubt observed, DeeDee is blissfully free of the ravages of intelligence.” He fixed his ironic gaze on Makepeace and added in his most condescending tone, “I am certain that you and she will get along just fine.”
~
“The path appears to branch ahead, and the stone would indicate that one way leads to death and the other leads to life.”
“Wow!” Sam whistled. “They don’t muck around with their directions, do they?”
~
“I don’t know. I never asked. Did Sha’re have a last name?” 
“Yeah, Jackson,” Daniel said brightly. 
“I mean before that.” 
“You’d never be able to pronounce it.” 
~
The phone sat on the end table, looking smug. Like Alice’s literary refreshments of ‘Eat me’ ‘Drink me’ fame, the slim instrument all but screamed ‘Pick me up.’ ‘Call your friends.’ ‘Don’t be such an ass, Jack.’ Ah, but the phone had made a fatal error. I liked being an ass. 
~
“He must have known an attack was a possibility, and had hoped the SGC would afford them some protection. Well, boys and girls, we might have: if we’d known about the possibility of said attack!”
~ Her eyes darted away from his as the term ‘quite worried’ took on its true meaning of ‘frantic’.
~
It turned out that they did let him out of the hospital, but only after the standard lecture in triplicate. Thou shalt not over exert oneself. Thou shalt do everything we doctors say. Thou shalt not make smart ass comments whilst being examined.
~
Jack was distracted by someone Hammond could not see. “I was getting to it, Daniel, keep your pants on.” He turned back to face the General. “Daniel would like someone to feed his fish.” O’Neill rolled his eyes.
~
“Unless you release your prisoners into our custody immediately, you can, in the words of one of our allies, ‘Kiss your ass, goodbye’.”
~ Some outposts attempted retaliation. Those outposts were short lived. Several accidents occurred in a busy Goa’uld shipping lane as six Asgard vessels appeared out of nowhere, weapons fully primed. Several of Anubis’ mother ships met each other in a bright conflagration while attempting to avoid them.
~
The day Jack walked the length of the infirmary without falling over once was declared a day of celebration. Unfortunately, Jack sulked because Janet wouldn’t let him have any of the champagne.
~ “I am Anubis. I am your God. From this day forth you will direct your allegiance to me.”
“Don’t you people ever change your lines? I am Niikrahl, and I’m no god, but I do have a whole lot more ships than you do, with enough weaponry to carve up that mikbar ship of yours like a quekchek holiday roast. I seriously suggest you reconsider your previous offer.”
~
His wrist still ached when it rained, but since most of his body had been broken at one time or another, he didn’t really notice amongst all the other aches he had when it rained.
~
He fiddled with his tie, damn thing was strangling him. A nudge from Daniel, and a pair of blue eyes told him to leave his tie alone. He glared back. His tie, his hands, his rules. Teal’c bowed his head slightly in respect before reaching out with both hands, clasping O’Neill’s tie, and wrestling it straight. He didn’t say a thing, but O’Neill had the distinct impression that if he reached a hand up to play with his tie once more, it might go missing before it could come in contact with it.
~
“Carter, did you just tread on the first living creature we’ve seen on this whole damn planet?” 
~
“I believe the phrase was ‘you go straight to hell, you miserable old penguin.’ That was the end of Catholic school for Jack.”
~
“I’ve got plans: Defeat Goa’uld. Romance Carter. Go fishing.” 
“Hey, I beat out fishing.” I joked softly. 
~
“I’ll send some pie or something with you next time. All kids like pie.”
“I like pie.”
“I rest my case.”
~
“The last time you asked me that question you had just shorted out the entire house trying to rewire the kitchen and you were trying to break it to me gently with a candlelit dinner.”
~
“Go get your stuff, kiddo. I’ll make my famous tuna noodle casserole surprise for dinner.”
Sara gave an unladylike snort. “The surprise being that I make it, of course.”
~ “I can’t remember where I left my car.”
“You came in the ambulance, Daniel.”
~ “You know that scene in the first Jurassic Park movie where they’re in the Jeep and they’re being chased by the tyrannosaur? And Jeff Goldblum’s character keeps yelling ‘Must go faster’? Well, I just wish we’d had a Jeep.”
Jack’s jaw dropped. “You were chased by a T Rex?” He grinned. “No way! That is so cool!”
“You were one of those obnoxious children who knew all the names of the dinosaurs before you could walk, weren’t you?”
~
“There may be another way, but in order for it to work we might have to commit one small act of treason.”
~
“He’s rich. He smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan smells like. And if you don’t know why that’s awesome you need awesome lessons.”
~ “If your initial presumption of Slavic or Germanic origins is correct, it’s likely that it’s either a traditional name of a hereditary type or perhaps has ties with any number of mythological tales or examples of oral history. Most names - taking into account, again, the presumption that it’s European in origin - have their origins in the Latin or the Bible, calling on Biblical characters or Latin root words to confer upon the recipient of the name a measure of strength or virility, or some other characteristic which the ancestors believed had some importance or would confer a favourable advantage onto its recipient. It is always possible, however, that it came not from such traditional venues but from somewhere a little more eclectic, like an ancient clan name or region or... I’m sorry, what was the question again?”
“I’m sure I knew when I asked, but that incredibly unhelpful - and yet unending - stream of utterly useless information has completely wiped it from my brain.”
~ “Teal’c, any particular reason you borrowed ‘The Craft’ from Cassie and stole ‘Magic, Witchcraft, and Religion: An Anthropological Study of the Supernatural’ out of my office earlier today? ‘Cos I have to say it’s starting to look a little suspicious.”
~ His mouth twitched. Sam made a growling noise deep in her throat and Daniel hastily ducked his head, taking several deep breaths. When he looked up, his face was straight.
~ Bombs, bombs, bombs. All anyone cared about was bombs. He had some lovely cuneiform tablets awaiting his attention, but was that a priority? No. “Dr. Rothman, is this a weapon?” “Dr. Rothman, when it blinks and starts vibrating, is that bad?” “Rothman, are you done with the doomsday/killing/annihilation machine from Neptune yet?”
~ “Does this mean you’re a...” Jack’s voice trailed off and he made the same circling motion as before with his hand, which apparently was supposed to translate as both ‘witch’ and ‘head-spinning projectile-vomiting spawn of Satan’.
~ Daniel kicked him under the table and wrote STOP LOOKING AT ME in large, very pointed letters on his pad.
~ “I’m sure. It’s not the first time people have thought I was crazy, Jack.” He looked suddenly thoughtful. “Although it is the first time it’s been true, now that I think about it. Huh.”
~ There were rumours on base that Sergeant Siler used the mashed potatoes to stop plumbing leaks, and no one who had ever tried to digest that particular offering could honestly discount the story as legend.
~
“Your use of the past tense fills me with foreboding.” 
~
“Lets go over something, Daniel- what is rule number one of going on a mission with another team?”
Daniel sighs and rolls his eyes. “Don’t get injured, kidnapped, killed, brainwashed, copied, or married,” he says dutifully. 
~ “We have to go outside after the wedding and wish them well.”
“But what if we do not wish them well?”
“Then we lie through our teeth.” 
~
“Of course I still have feelings for you,” Sam exclaimed, all but adding ‘You idiot.’ “That isn’t the point.” 
~
“I have a gun,” he said flatly. Again, not much reaction, other then a common ‘why are you telling me this’ quirk of the eyebrows. 
“So do I.” Obviously he had bigger things on his mind then the worry that he’d get shot by a wanted man in an abandoned parking lot.
~ “Is that thing actually working?” 
“We’re not being blasted from orbit. I’d say that is sufficient evidence that it is doing its job!”
~
“If he dies, you die. Tell me their plan.”
“I’ve lived a full life. Figure it out for yourself.”
~
“Jack, if you could spare some time to do this in between all your plotting—”
“It’s tactical planning, Daniel.” Jack said sourly. 
~
“I thought I told you not to go driving off any cliffs.”
“It wasn’t a cliff.  It was an... embankment.  And I didn’t drive off it.”
“How do you feel?”
“Like I just drove off a cliff.”
“I have it on pretty good authority,” he says softly, “that it was an embankment.”
~
“Are you really here... or is this just the drugs talking?”
“Drugs talk?”
~
‘I’ before ‘E’ except after ‘C’ and in sounding like ‘A’ as in neighbour and weigh, and on weekends and holidays and all throughout May, and you’ll always be wrong, no matter what you say.
~
I turned again and found him standing nearer than before and moving closer, body radiating warmth, eyes radiating a different kind of heat.
~
I jumped as though electrically shocked, I knocked the intruder’s hand away and spun, my back hitting the door, not much room to defend myself but God damn it I would sure as hell try... The ‘intruder’ took a few hasty steps back and stared at me in amused puzzlement. 
~
They had eye contact for maybe a total of three seconds, but they had an entire conversation.
~ As pits went, this one was horribly unimaginative.
~
I hadn’t observed a tail of any kind from Logan, hadn’t witnessed anything suspicious in Dale City, but my instincts were still screaming at me like banshees. Telling me to keep moving, to keep looking over my shoulder, to trust no one. My instincts had apparently seen too many episodes of The X-Files.
~
“‘Stole’ is such a harsh word,” Thor protested. 
~
“They’d believe we could kill a god and still try to kill us?”
“Panic and logic are mutually exclusive.
~
“Your son looks like you.” She spoke without taking her eyes from the sky.
“Is that a good thing or should I start apologising to him now?”
~
“I’m going to count to ten,” General Hammond’s voice reverberated off the mountain, “and if anyone is pointing a gun at anyone else by the time I am finished I will have you all court marshalled.”
~ The guy watched him drive away, the beginnings of a smirk on his face, which confused the part of Daniel’s brain that bothered to worry about such things. He’d understood it about thirty seconds later when he’d been forced off the road by a lunatic driver in a black van.
~
“And by vacation I assume you mean that no one will try to shoot us?”
~ “You say ‘vacation,’ I say ‘new-age hippie therapist summer camp nightmare.’”  He paused thoughtfully and then added, “In Canada.”
~
“What’s wrong with my interpersonal skills?” Jack demanded. In the chair next to him, Daniel slid his eyes awkwardly to the side, stopping just short of innocent whistling.
~ “Is it possible that ‘embracing ourselves’ is actually a euphemism for eating sandwiches? Because I made a lot of progress on me this morning and I’ve worked up quite an appetite.”
~
Grumpy and Curly were a blur of arms and utensils and vegetables as the contents of their salads were deftly renegotiated.  Radishes and carrots migrated from one plate to another, while the slices of onions were scraped carefully onto a bread plate to ensure a complete and harmonious exchange.  The process went smoothly until a brief argument erupted over who had stolen whose cherry tomato. 
~ “What do you mean, drugged?  With what?”
“With drugs, obviously,” 
~ “Think about it this way, would you let some cop fly a plane through rough weather if there was already a perfectly good pilot in the cockpit?”
“Would I be in the plane at the time?”
~
“Okay,” he conceded, “but just keep in mind whose fault it’ll be if we get all drugged-up and talkative and wind up having to spend the rest of our lives in Canada because we’re wanted in the States for divulging national secrets to terrorists.”
“Chief, we don’t know any national secrets.”
~
“I don’t like him,” Jim declared. “He smells funny.”
~ It had taken Hobbes about a New York microsecond to barge into the hotel kitchen, delve into a gaggle of identical-looking waiters, and emerge from the throng dragging the one he was after by the collar.
~ “Because he is a morally upstanding federal agent and would never do such a thing.  Would you, Fawkes?”
Darien lay on his back, tossing and catching an apple he had stolen from the lobby.  “Nope,” he confirmed. 
~ After a lengthy debate on the roof, Jack had curtly demanded to be provided with a “cheat sheet” delineating all of his facial expressions and their precise interpretations.
~
“We’ll be back in... an indeterminate amount of time,” added Curly in what sounded suspiciously like sympathy but was probably college-boy sarcasm.
~
“You brought a zat?” he exclaimed, gaping at Jack in unchecked affront.  “To a no-weapons mandated federal workshop?” 
“I had my story all planned out,” he assured him.  “I was going to tell them it was a foot massager.”
“And if that didn’t work?”
“Then I’d tell them it was yours,” he retorted, offering up his most mischievous grin.
~
The first, second, and third things that went through Darien’s mind were, “Ow,” “Ow,” and “Ow.”  In that order.  The fourth one was, “What the fuck?!”  And the fifth one was, “Ow.”
~
“Hobbes is a good man. I’ll give him that.  But I think it’s inevitable that at some point very early on Teal’c would find himself compelled to shoot him.”
“A valid concern,” Daniel agreed, both amused and disturbed by the likely accuracy of the prediction.
~ “I just told you there’s an invisible shape shifting assassin running around the place and all you can say is oh?”
~
“She won’t discuss it. Says she doesn’t remember anything.”
“It’s possible—”
“But the way she wakes up screaming sort of suggests otherwise.”
~
River muttered something nonsensical about the ratio between their chances of escaping the Alliance cruiser, and the likelihood of the ship exploding before they reached safe airspace. Mal glared at his pilot, annoyed. “River, never tell me the odds.”
~
She even used a very small amount of C4 to try to blow a piece off. When that didn’t work, she used a much larger piece. This was getting annoying. Time to break out the big guns, and by big guns, I mean the highly experimental, high-power laser cutters.
~ “Well, either we’re due for a tax rebate of several hundred dollars, or we’re so far in debt we need to sell one of the kids.”
~
“I cannot translate his words. Or more accurately, I will not translate his words. They are very rude.”
~
I have seen in his eyes the germ of hate then he rises above his baser feelings. I am in awe of this man. In similar circumstances, I would have ripped the lungs from my wife’s kidnapper’s body.
~
“We should have been dashed to death. Instead of just feeling like we’ve been dashed to death,” Jack said sarcastically. “I hate this planet.”
~ “Guys, willing to help me disobey a direct order?” 
Daniel smiled. “Already working on it.” 
~ “Would you prefer your ‘big fireball’?” 
“No. No I wouldn’t. I have the disturbing feeling you’d be able to arrange that for me…” 
~
“Dr. Fraiser has dismembered it.” 
“It’s called an autopsy, Teal’c,” Sam corrects him. 
“You say tomato, I say dismemberment,” he rebuts calmly. 
~
How were they supposed to know the guy was an astrophysicist who specialized in quantum theory? It hadn’t said that anywhere on his Harley Davidson. Personally O’Neill thought astrophysicists had an obligation to look like astrophysicists and not like people called Hammer Boy Billy from Arkansas
~ “I have no problem with that. Especially as I don’t know about it. Because I never saw this and we never had this conversation.”
~ O’Neill wondered if all Brits were as crap at self-expression as this guy was or if it was just an archaeologist thing. Nelson and Daniel were staring at each other like long lost brothers, radiating happiness to see one another again, and the best they could manage was a stumbling mention of the other’s name and an incredibly awkward hug.
~ “Shouting something more loudly does not make it more true.”
“Well, can I just deck him then? I promise I’ll do it quietly.”
~
“Just tell me what I need to know to use it. Not what I need to build a new one from scratch out of my cellphone and a car battery.” 
~ “Don’t you think it’s odd?”
“That you have all the sense of direction of a doorknob?” Jack considered and then shrugged. “No, I’m kind of used to it now.”
~ It was presumably when he had been tying O’Neill’s bonds that Golding had found his revolver; something he was now waving about as he held a conversation with his dead wife. At least that was who O’Neill assumed the man was talking to. There was a lot of shouting; occasional hysterical fits of crying, and some of the conversation was taking place in what he guessed was Ancient Babylonian, so it was a little tricky to follow. 
~ “If it wasn’t there how could you see it too?” he panted.
“I’m psychic. What’s your excuse?” 
~ “You had a broken rib sticking in your lung and you told them you were ‘fine’.”
“Am I a doctor?” O’Neill countered. “How was I supposed to know I had a broken rib?”
~ “I didn’t do it on purpose,” he protested. “At no point did I invite one of his loony-tune grave-robber pals to take me prisoner!”
~ They were currently playing something called ‘Chicago Lowball’ with rules that they seemed to have made up and which only they understood. Despite the now numerous occasions on which Daniel had been dragged into playing with them he was no wiser about what he was supposed to be trying to achieve. Every time he’d thought he’d lost he’d been handed a Snickers bar and every time he thought he’d finally accumulated a decent hand he was told ‘better luck next time’ and denied his sip of whiskey.
~ “Don’t be absurd. If you’re thirty-six that means I’m almost seventy and that’s clearly untrue.”
“Alexis, you’ve got four grandchildren,” Nelson pointed out equably. 
~ “I’m sure part of the agreement to you coming on this vacation was a ‘no-whining’ clause.”
“I said ‘oh wow’ in a ‘take me to that Spam Museum now’ kind of way, with just a hint of ‘lots of big icy lakes with no fish in them’ and a ‘whoopee’ as well.”
~ The size of the fish people kept brandishing at him in this state was very disconcerting. The locals were even proud of the fact their mosquitoes looked like those which came in swarms of Biblical plague proportions.
~ “Jack, your sister’s married to a man called Olaf, who, as far as I can tell, has seventeen brothers also all called Olaf.”
~ Lois would use the word ‘preposterous’, but she’s afraid that the bumpkins wouldn’t understand anything with more than four letters.
~ “Remember, their race tried very hard to weed out aggression in their society and ended up weeding out the entire male portion of their species in the process. Marla expected to find riots in the streets when she came here.”
“But we do have riots in the streets.”
“Not as a matter of daily course,” Daniel argued. “Luckily they are still rare and happen only under duress. We don’t wander around with weapons from one battle to the next.”
“Yes we do,” Jack persisted.
Daniel sighed wearily. “Yes, we do on occasion. But the general population doesn’t.”
~
“One day. I leave you alone for one day and you start an uprising.”
~ “But why would any ruler decorate his lair with instructions that explain how to kill him?”
~
“So, we go with plan B and extricate him in twenty four hours.”
“Twenty-two hours and thirty seven minutes.”
~
More servants entered the hallway from a nearby room and seemed excited to find an unexpected visitor. They surrounded Jack and bowed to him happily. “This has got to be the weirdest siege in history.” 
~
“These are your belongings, of course.” Daniel scanned the mass of bags, boxes, and crates, complete with Hareet and his two bath buddies. 
“Leetha, do we need to have the ‘human beings are not possessions’ discussion again?”
~
“The new medication? Oh, that’s working great,” Daniel said with false enthusiasm. “Now I vomit blood.”
~
I said we should give a relationship a try, and he paled, stuttered and chugged champagne. 
~ “Bloody hell, how much time has passed for you? You look like your mother. Ow, ow, stop hitting me. Jack, make her stop hitting me.”
~ “So Ianto says ‘Don’t look her in the eye, you’ll frighten her,’ and I say ‘I’ll frighten her?!’”
“Hang on,” Rose interrupted Jack’s latest instalment of 101 things not to do with a live Pterodactyl, “How did you know it was a girl?”
~ “Martha!” he shouted after her. “Change into something practical! You can’t go on a quest in your Jimjams!”
~ “We got rescued by the enemy,” she replied disgustedly. “God, that’s embarrassing.”
~
“You put spinach in mine,” he said, poking at it. “And chopped it too finely to eat around.”
“It’s food you didn’t have to cook or pay for yourself. Something tells me you’ll manage to choke it down.”
“Trying to force healthy eating habits on me - I have a Wilson for that.”
“You can’t really eat like a teenager. You pretend to, but you can’t possibly - you’d have keeled over from malnutrition years ago.”
“You’re just jealous of my girlish figure.”
~
“You know, humans successfully hunted prey for millennia without once using a pheromone scanner.”
~
“But this fellow’s hardly covering his tracks. Look, there,” he indicated a patch of grass that was, to Gwen’s eye, incredibly similar to every patch of grass in a 5 mile radius.
~ Their bios were classified into the stratosphere. Not just need-to-know, but situationally capable of kissing the President’s ass classified.
~
He was to spend half his time passing on his knowledge of hand-to-hand combat and the other half learning to blow stuff up.
~ Damned if she did and damned if she shot them all.
~
“What is this?” she asked blankly.
O’Neill rolled his eyes.” That is a rifle, Carter.”
“From what century?” she demanded.
O’Neill raised an eyebrow.” I carried one of those for years, Carter.”
“Yes, Sir,” she said dubiously. “Did you hit anything with it, Sir?”
“I am so going to enjoy reminding you about this conversation, Carter. Now pay attention. You are too drugged for live ammo. Repeat after me: the clips stay in the pack.”
~ Daniel and Teal’c shifted reflexively, field training frustrated by office furniture. Unable to take up flanking positions, they settled for looming. Well...Teal’c loomed. Daniel crossed his arms and looked watchful.
~
“Did you notice he even hangs Jayne’s tee-shirts?” Zoe added, in awe.
“Beginning to think Jayne hates that,” Wash replied. “Makes him think he has to bathe more often.”
“Wouldn’t want a man to change his entire lifestyle for a shirt,” Mal grinned.
“This would explain what’s been happening to our water supply, Captain,” Zoe pointed out.
“Hell, I’d hate to have to take Simon off laundry duty because Jayne’s getting clean. Finally.”
~
“Training.” He said in such a serious voice that it made Johnny want to go talk to someone else.
~ “Now, who can cook?”
No hands went up. Jack rolled his eyes. “Great. We’re going to starve.”
Cam sighed. “I can cook.”
Sam looked at him curiously. “Why didn’t you say so?”
“Well, ‘cause my cooking will kill you.”
Jack was quickly losing patience. “So, you can’t cook?”
“No, I can cook,” Cam assured him. “Fried chicken, biscuits and sausage gravy, shepherd’s pie. My grandma taught me. It all tastes good, but it’s like a heart attack in a pan.”
~ “Sorry, Jack.” Cam emphasized the name, then began practicing – Jack, Jack, Jack – under his breath.
~ They argue over a six-letter word for trouble beginning with T when he insists it must be Tok’ra, and she lets him write it in if only to see how he’ll find a way of starting 22 down with an apostrophe.
~ Whoever said that flying a desk was cushier than getting shot at, and by “whoever” he meant “himself circa any year prior to 2004”, had clearly never heard the words fiscal summary.
~ He figured the dining room table was off-limits for sex if it was covered with toaster parts, but he was okay with amending his plan so that the nearest flat surface became the nearest flat surface with nothing sharp on it.
~ Daniel and Teal’c might like him a whole lot, but he was under absolutely no illusions – if he ever did wrong by Samamantha, former brothers-in-arms or otherwise, those two would band together and kill him. 
~
“Aren’t you supposed to ask Jack to ask me if I would ask Janet if she would go out with you?”
“No. Jack would mock me.”
“Daniel, I am mocking you.”
~
“Let’s just say... I’m a friend.”
“Yeah, well, maybe I don’t want a friend.”
“I didn’t say I was yours.”
~
“Cool! Crossbow! Check out these babies. Goodbye stakes, hello flying fatality.”
~
“I didn’t jump to conclusions. I took a small step, and conclusions were there.”
~
“Are you crazy? You just don’t sneak up on people in a graveyard. You make noise when you walk, you stomp, or... yodel.”
~ “No, those weren’t vampires. Those were just guys in need of a facial. Or maybe they had rabies? It could’ve been rabies. And that guy turning to dust? Just a trick of light.”
~ “Dates are things normal girls have. Girls who have time to think about nail polish and facials. You know what I think about? Ambush tactics. Beheading.” 
~ “Why go to all the trouble to dig up three girls only to chop them up and throw them away? It doesn’t make any sense, especially from a time management standpoint.”
~ “I knew it! I knew it! Well, not in the sense of having the slightest idea, but I knew there was something I didn’t know.”
~
“We can’t run, that would be wrong. Could we hide?”
~
“I don’t like vampires. I’m going to take a stand and say they’re not good.”
~
“I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.”
~
“Cavalry’s here! Cavalry’s a scared guy with a club, but it’s here!”
~
“We’re right behind you, only further back.”
~
“For I am Xander, king of cretins. Let all lesser cretins bow before me.”
~
“Recording a bat-sonar is something soothingly kin to having one’s teeth drilled.”
~
“It was hardly the worst mistake you’ll ever make... That wasn’t quite as comforting as it was meant to be.”
~ “Things involving the computers fill me with a childlike terror. Now, if it were a nice ogre or some such, I’d be more in my element.”
~
“Yes, and you were very nearly devoured by a giant demon snake. The words ‘Let that be a lesson’ are a tad redundant at this juncture.”
~ “Yeah, I was at Woodstock. I fed off a flower person and I spent six hours watching my hand move.”
~ “I would, but I’m paralyzed with not caring very much.”
~
“Well, our old place was just fine ‘til you went and had it burned down.”
~
“Well, that was sad. I’m embarrassed for our kind.”
~
“Well, it’s not really the kind of message you tell. It sort of involves finding the bodies of all your friends.”
~ “I’m sorry about the chains. It’s not that I don’t trust you... Actually, it is that I don’t trust you.”
~ “Milady, you’ll find that with the exception of an honest day’s work, there’s no challenge I’m not prepared to face.”
~
“I’ve got to learn to just do the damage and leave town. It’s the stay-’n’-gloat that gets me every time.”
~ “When I’m around you, I find myself needing to know the plural of apocalypse.”
~
“Every nightmare I have that doesn’t revolve around academic failure or public nudity is about that thing. In fact, once I dreamt that it attacked me while I was late for a test and naked.”
~ “Well, we could grind our enemies into talcum powder with a sledgehammer, but, gosh, we did that last night.”
~ “You can’t turn your back on the Council.”
“They’re in England. I don’t think they can tell which way my back is facing.”
~
“I know who you are.”
“Yeah, I know who I am too, so what?”
~
“Why don’t you rip her lungs out? That might make an impression.”
“Lacks... poetry.”
“Doesn’t have to. What rhymes with lungs?”
~
“Your face is a poem. I can read it.”
“It doesn’t say “spare me” by any chance?”
~
“I’m naming the stars. But I’ve named them all the same name, and there’s terrible confusion.”
“You can’t see the stars, love. That’s the ceiling. Also it’s day.”
~
“So, do you steal weapons from the Army often?”
“Well, we don’t get cable, so we have to make our own fun.”
~
“Trouble’s coming. There are some things I can just smell. It’s like a sixth sense.”
“No, actually, that would be one of the five.”
~
“Have I ever let you down?”
“Do you want me to answer that, or shall I just glare?”
~
“You just don’t like him ‘cause of that time he beat you up every day for five years.”
“Yeah, I’m irrational that way.”
~ “As the soon-to-be-purple area on my jaw will attest, I did not “let” her go.”
~
“The band! They’re great. They march. Like an army. Except with music, instead of bullets, and usually no one dies.”
~
“I only wish I had my powers back. I’d liquefy his entrails for her.”
~
“This is just too much. I mean, yesterday’s my life like ‘Uh oh, pop quiz’. Today, it’s ‘rain of toads’.”
~ “I’m afraid I don’t know a bloody thing about myself… Except I seem to be British, don’t I? And a man…with glasses.”
~ “It might take hours. Days maybe. Anyone suggesting months would not be accused of crazy talk.”
~
“Now, we can do this the hard way, or... well, actually there’s just the hard way.”
~
“You’ve done some beheading in your time?”
“Oh, yeah. There was this time I was pinned down by this guy that played left tackle for varsity... Well, at least he used to before he was a vampire... Anyway, he had this really, really thick neck, and all I had was a little, little Exact-O knife... You’re not loving this story.”
“No, actually, I find it oddly comforting.”
~
“Ladies and Gentlemen! There is no cause for alarm. Actually, there is cause for alarm. It just won’t do any good.”
~
“Why should someone want to harm Cordelia? Well, maybe because they met her…”
~
“What was I supposed to do? Say to Owen, ‘Sorry I was late, I was sitting in a cemetery with the librarian waiting for a vampire to rise so I could prevent an evil prophecy from coming to pass’?”
“Or “flat tire”?”
~
“They give me the wig. Ever since I was little.”
“What happened?”
“I saw a dummy. It gave me the wig. There really wasn’t a story there.”
~
“Monsters don’t usually send messages. It’s pretty much crush, kill, destroy.”
~
“Grave robbing? That’s new. Interesting.”
“I know you meant to say gross and disturbing.”
~ “And he broke her heart, thus possibly proving its existence.”
~
“Well, what I saw didn’t add up to three whole girls. I think they kept some parts.”
“Could this get yuckier?”
“They probably kept the other parts to eat.”
“Question answered.”
~
“I hope this story ends with, ‘And she lived happily ever after.’”
“No, I think it ends with, ‘And she became a scary, discoloured, shrivelled mummy.’”
~
“We’ll deal with that when we’ve ruled out evil curses.”
“One day I’m going live in a town where evil curses are just generally ruled out without even saying.”
~
“She’s from the past. And you’re a ghost. I just want you to know that I’m taking a lot on faith here.”
~
“Well, they don’t make angry mobs like they used to, because she’s definitely still alive.”
~
“We all have flaws. I’m still a little fuzzy on exactly what yours is. I think it has to do with being a lying scumbag.”
~
“Now, this may sting a little just at first. But don’t worry, that’ll go away once the searing pain kicks in.”
~
“He looked normal!”
“What, is he supposed to have an arrow with the word “assassin” over his head?”
~
“Parental issues. What? Freud would’ve said the exact same thing. Except he might not have done that little dance.”
~
“And, you know, with the pain and the death, maybe you shouldn’t be leaping into the fray like that. Maybe you should be... fray-adjacent.”
“Excuse me? Who, at a crucial moment, distracted the lead demon by allowing her to pummel him about the head?”
~
“Great knife…You gave it a girl’s name. How very serial killer of you.”
~
“Personally don’t think it’s impossible to come up with a crazier plan.”
“We attack the Mayor with hummus.”
“I stand corrected.”
~ “If I could just get something for the pain. It’s rather a lot of pain, actually. Aspirin? Perhaps I could just be knocked unconscious.”
~
“He’s still on his cross-country-see-America thing. He said he wasn’t coming back until he had driven to all fifty states.”
“Did you explain about Hawaii?”
“Oh, he seemed so determined.”
~ “No, the fact that you’re fat makes you look fat. That sweater just makes you look purple.”
~ “I can’t believe the vampires took your stuff. Murder I expect, but petty larceny seems so... petty.”
~
“So, either you hit her, or you did your wacky mime routine for her.”
“Well, I didn’t do either, actually. But she deserves it, don’t you think?”
“Nobody deserves a mime.”
“Kathy does. She deserves to be locked in an invisible box and blown away by an imaginary wind and forced to wear a binding unitard.”
~
“Hello? Yes. ... Yes, we’re well aware of that. ... We’re under siege now, actually. ... Thank you.”
~
“Well, Porter dorm is completely blacked out. So naturally they are dealing with the crisis the only way they know how: Aftershock Party.”
“Ah, this from the dorm that brought us the ‘Somebody Sneezed’ party and the ‘Day That Ends in Y’ party.”
~
“Not really much for conversation. I had a couple of them working for me once. They’re more like, ‘Like to crush. Crush now?’”
~
“Well, why don’t we experiment? Press some buttons, see what happens.”
“I’d like to veto that. It’s called a blaster, Will, a word that tends to discourage experimentation.”
~
“Well, Jonathan saw the markings on the wall and he kind of... blinked.”
“He blinked? The man moistened his eyeballs and we’re having a meeting about it.”
~ “Zombies don’t eat brains anyway unless instructed to by their zombie masters. A lot of people get that wrong.”
~
“The way I see it, life is like an interstellar journey. Some people go into hypersleep and travel at sub-light speeds, only to get where they’re going after years of struggle, toil and hard, hard work. We, on the other hand blast through the space-time continuum in a wormhole. Gentlemen, crime is our wormhole.”
“But, everyone knows if the width of a wormhole cavity is a whole number of wavelengths, plus a fraction of that wavelength, the coinciding particle activity collapses the infrastructure.”
“Dude. Don’t be a geek.”
~
“Will you still make me waffles when we’re married?”
“No, I’ll only make them for myself, but by California law, you will own half of them.”
~
“Can we talk?”
“Vocal-cord-wise, yes. With each other? No.”
~
“Honestly! ‘And he shall smite them down with pink sandals,’ Dawn?”
“It says ‘pink’!” Dawn protested with an angry jab at the original text before her.
~ “You set them on me?”
“Well, ‘set on’ as in ‘couldn’t prevent.’”
~ “You’re not going to threaten me too, are you? ‘Cause I think you’ll have to get in line. She’s already claimed my arms and Mr. Giles hinted they wouldn’t be able to find my body.”
~ “He was on his way back to Washington when he suddenly developed a nasty case of boils on his ass.” He lifted innocent eyebrows at his son who couldn’t stop the glee from surfacing. “Now the firing was ...understandable. Expected, even. But the boils ...well they figure they’re some sort of alien virus that he picked up here. Funny thing is, no one else seems to have the same symptoms.”
“You know, I have this friend,” said Xander, conversationally “You really shouldn’t hurt people she cares about. She gets a little cranky.”
“Does she like presents?”
~
“Everybody who’s not dead or unconscious, sound off.”
~
“Oh, no, I do,” he tells her, quickly and unconvincingly, adding, “No, really,” in a slightly panicky tone when her eyes narrow.
~ “We’re heading for the…oops. So much for using the Hummer to get you guys up and out… Not ‘oops’ as in ‘screwed up’. More like ‘oops’ as in ‘didn’t realize that your invincible Army truck was gonna land on its roof’.”
~ “And, if it’s not too much trouble, may I have a cup of coffee?”
“Thought you British guys drank tea,” Benson raised an eyebrow at him.
“If there were an actual cup of properly brewed tea to be found anywhere on this misbegotten continent, I would claim it in a heartbeat. I’ve learned to manage with coffee,” he answered.
~ “You know,” he said. “Somehow it’s always a bad thing when I wake up on my back surrounded by worried people.”
~ “I tried to get into an international university and they wouldn’t accept me because of ‘problems at previous schools’. Like talisman-controlled zombies was really my fault.”
~
“And the fact that your 740 verbal closely resembles my combined scores in no way compromises your position as the village idiot.”
~
“Remember the three key words for any Slayer: preparation... preparation... preparation.” 
“That’s one word three times.”
~
“If you want to criticize my methods, fine. But keep your snide remarks to yourself. And while you’re at it, don’t criticize my methods.” ~
“Demons after money? Whatever happened to the still beating heart of a virgin? No one has any standards anymore.”
~
“Okay, what’s in the bag?” 
“My lunch.” 
“Is that the new drug lingo?” 
“No, it’s my lunch.”
~ “Hey, I eat danger for breakfast.” 
“But oddly enough, she panics in the face of breakfast foods.”
~
“And you have the emotional maturity of a blueberry scone.”
~
“And you just accepted that? I only said that because I thought that’s what you wanted to hear.” 
“That’s the funny thing about me, I tend to hear the actual words people say and accept them at face value.” 
“That’s stupid.” 
“I accept that.”
~ “You think you and your friends can just keep waltzing into a government installation, brandishing weapons like... like...” 
“It’s a gourd. A magic gourd.” 
“What kind of freaks are you people?”
~
“Ah, Mort. I trust you made our guest... comfortable?”
“You told me to chain her to a wall…”
~
“But you have references.”
“No, I have Albert, which is me doing an important voice. ‘Mr. Harrison? An excellent tenant. And a very nice-looking fellow.’”
~
“Ah, the city dump. Where smells go to relax and be themselves… People say they’re recycling. They’re not recycling.”
~
“On my seventh birthday I wanted a toy fire truck, and I didn’t get it, and you were real nice about it, and then the house next door burnt down, and then real fire trucks came, and for years I thought you set the fire for me. And if you did, you can tell me.”
~ “At first it’s just a place, then you start to make memories, and you’re like, that’s where Spike slept, and there, that’s where Anya and I drowned the Separvo demon. Oh! And right there, that’s where I got my heart all ripped out. I really hate this place.”
~ “Did you see? Customers! Real customers! They came in and I gave them things and they gave me money and then they left! It’s brilliant!”
~
“You said it wasn’t that bad.”
“I said I’ve seen worse. There’s a difference.”
~
“Luminous... no. Irradiant’s better. Oh, quickly! I’m the very spirit of vexation. What’s another word for ‘gleaming’? It’s a perfectly perfect word as many words go but the bother is nothing rhymes, you see.”
~
“That’s a brilliant strategy really... pure cunning.”
“Sod off! Come on. When was the last time you unleashed it? All out fight in a mob, back against the wall, nothing but fists and fangs? Don’t you ever get tired of fights you know you’re going to win?”
“No. A real kill. A good kill. It takes pure artistry. Without that, we’re just animals.”
“Poofter!”
~
“When a person makes a ‘destroy all vampires’ date, it’s simple courtesy to wait for your co-destroyers. Am I right, Miles?”
“I’m almost certain you’re not, but to be fair, I wasn’t listening.”
~ “Oh, yeah, fun was had. Also frolic, merriment, and near-death hijinks.”
~
“So, uh, we’re all thinking the same thing, right?”
“Festive pinata? Delicious candy?”
“Something evil crashed to earth in this and then broke out and... slithered away to do badness.”
“In all fairness, we don’t really know about the slithered part.”
“Oh, no. I’m sure it frisked about like a fluffy lamb.”
~
“Make fun of the ex-demon! I can just hear you in private. ‘I dislike that Anya. She’s newly human and strangely literal.’”
“I don’t say that. No one says that. No one talks that way.”
~
“We can come by between classes! Usually I use that time to copy over my class notes with a system of different coloured pens... but it’s been pointed out to me that that’s, you know, insane.”
~
“Are you talking to me hoping that I’ll get so depressed that I’ll impale myself on a fork right in front of you?”
~
“You’re hairy, and unattractive, and even women trolls are put off by your various odours. Your menacing stance is merely alarming! And your roar is less than full-throated!”
~
“Bloody hell! You threw me through a window! What’s that about?”
“You do not make those suggestions to me. I have a boyfriend. Warren is my boyfriend.”
“You know what? My bleeding sympathies to Warren.”
~
“Glory. Her name is Glory, and she’s your god, you little scab, not mine.”
“With all due respect and-and fear of sharp objects, you exist, sir, only because of her divine greatness.”
~
“I could drive faster and I can’t drive! You’re like a snail. A snail who’s driving a car very slowly.”
~ “He kept poking me with his hook. I sent him over to charmed objects. With any luck he’ll poke the wrong one and end up in an alternative dimension inhabited by a 50-foot Ogre that squishes annoying teeny pirates.”
~
“Like, like Lex Luthor. He’s always trying to take over Metropolis, but he doesn’t kill Superman!”
“Because it’s Superman’s book, you moron.”
~
What it came down to was that the Doctor, ultimately, wanted to be found. Of course, Pete was prepared to rethink that, after they got into the house and Jackie smacked the Doctor on the side of the head with a wooden spoon.
~
“I feel it’s only fair to inform you, Sir. That if you hurt her, I’ll retroactively shoot you for coming into the office without permission.”
~
“Faster than a speeding bullet? Don’t make me laugh! I can yawn fifty seven times in the time it takes for a bullet to leave the barrel! More powerful than a locomotive? Colossus can derail one of those without breaking a sweat! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound? Give me a brea-” Superman’s fist shot out, so fast that it didn’t even appear to move. One moment it was at his side. The next it was rigid and Quicksilver was clothes-lined on it. His eyes were wide and his body was practically doubled over Superman’s forearm.
The Man of Steel tossed him down. “No one ever said how much faster than a speeding bullet I am.”
~
“But really, if you want to shoot me, go ahead. I can assure you, though, that my wife—who’s standing just to your left—is an excellent shot with those two mini-blasters she just stole.
“I didn’t steal them. I liberated them from a much-less-deserving owner who planned to kill me.”
“And Col. Sheppard, who’s a few feet to her right, hasn’t had the chance to shoot anyone all week and he’s bored.”
“I wouldn’t say bored,” Sheppard said. “Twitchy, maybe.”
“And if you plan to shoot anyone,” Teal’c added, “shoot me first, because if you do not, I will Rip. Your. Head. Off.”
~
Because everybody knew that Jack O’Neill didn’t do speeches. Everybody, apparently, except for Cam, who simply ignored him when he said he wouldn’t do it. And ignored him when he repeated it. And ignored him when he slammed down the phone.
~
The general had told his aid he’d had a bad reaction to the blood pudding at lunch, (and really, how could you not?), and would be unable to attend another horrible evening of picking out the proper fork and listening to people announce long honorifics and give dull speeches. After that it wasn’t very difficult to climb out his window and then scale the embassy fence.
~
He was mildly surprised that his feet obeyed, and then realized that he should be more then just mildly surprised. Oh, crap! Mind control. As that clear thought forced its way into his head, the foggy happy feeling faded away.
~
“We are in Little Hangleton, General,” Teal ‘c answered.
“Which is where exactly?”
“I believe it is three miles west of Great Hangleton.”
~
“I’m going to shoot you,” he answered vaguely. That didn’t sound like the right thing to say at all. He looked back at Carter, who turned her rifle on him. That also seemed rather off.
“Put your weapon down Sir. You’ve been compromised.”
~
O’Neill struggled to remember his name; Halfpence, Shilling, Euro? It was some kind of money. He looked to Daniel, who mouthed “Farthing” at him as unobtrusively as possible.
~
“Neither seems particularly talkative. The kid was still unconscious as of the beginning of this briefing, and the adult hasn’t spoken a word since he woke up. He was sedated during medical treatment and seems to be holding it against us. He won’t give a name. He just glares.”
“What pressures have you applied?” Farthing asked, with imaginary quotes around the word “pressures”.
“We threatened to shut off the cable in his room, but so far he hasn’t cracked. If that doesn’t work there’s always bed without dessert.” 
~ Farthing said the American Air Force had no right to interfere and no right to carry out police actions on British soil. O’Neill pointed out that the cult members had attacked him. Farthing insisted the prisoners be turned over to British authorities, since they had been proved, as Dr. Jackson pointed out, to be natives of England and not of some foreign planet. O’Neill said their alien technology put them under SGC jurisdiction. Farthing said to keep the technology and turn over the people. O’Neill said it’s not going to happen. Farthing demanded an interview with the prisoners at M15 headquarters. O’Neill said the prisoners were being held in the U.S. embassy, and weren’t going anywhere. Farthing made a derogatory comment about the U.S. Air Force. O’Neill made a derogatory comment about Farthing’s mother.
~
“The flowers are from him. Well, sort of. He actually wanted to send you the severed talons of an M’tarn, but Teal’c convinced him these would be better received. It’s a thank-you gift, for your assistance in the battle.”
~ “I woke up with mashed potatoes in my nose. Just so you know that’s not normal, even for me.”
~
“I’m fourteen for Merlin’s sake; the only excuse I can properly have for requiring someone else to carry me is some sort of limb amputation.”
~
“You’re Viktor Krum!” I said stupidly, as if he didn’t know. Fortunately he was saying “You’re Harry Potter!” at the same time, so I didn’t feel so bad.
~
The Aurors still couldn’t figure out if the invisible nut job was after the Minister of Magic (who is in charge of the British magical government), the Minister of Bulgaria (who has quite a few political enemies apparently), or me (who everyone likes to shoot at on general principle).
~
“We didn’t have time to stop and chat. Ron did spare him a gesture that clearly conveyed our sentiments.”
~ “Our last run in with him hadn’t turned out so well. We were attacked by Dementors. I was tortured by a rat and bitten by a werewolf. Hermione only got 8 out of 10 on the homework she did that night. We were all scarred.”
~
Something touched my hand under the water and in my mind the word SHARK became very large.
~ “They weren’t very responsible when it came to feeding prisoners. I’m sure not one of them owned a goldfish that lasted more then a day.”
~
I told them they had drugged me so I couldn’t really say how I had ended up in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Which is where he informed me I was.
~ The boy hissed and kicked Remus in the leg. “That’s rather rude,” Remus said.
“We’re going to kill you,” the growling boy said. “I’m going to tear off your face with my teeth when the moon rises.”
“That doesn’t make your behaviour now any more acceptable,” Remus pointed out.
~ He took Carter’s hand, and was reminded that his wrist was dislocated.
~ “Do wizards really exist?”
“Do you have clearance to ask these kinds of questions?”
~ “Have you finished up there? There are only so many times I can wave a scanner over her and say everything’s fine…”
~
“When you’re making a point, try citing people who didn’t try to grope me.”
~ Then there was the formal tutorial, also conducted by Batman, or as she now affectionately referred to him: That Bastard.
~ “He’s not going to chew me out for being too rough on Nicky?”
“Knowing Batman, he’ll chew you out for leaving him in a condition to walk.”
~ “Lost as in ‘I have no purpose for living and will soon run amok?’ Or lost as in ‘My wife is living with another guy, but I’ll learn to cope’?”
~
He glanced at Rob who’s shaking his head as hard as he can and signalling for Bruce to not get into this particular conversation.
~ But somehow they kept ending up here, with Clark crouching beside her to check her pulse, not that he was worried or anything, waiting for her to wake up and start in on harassing him for getting them into this crazy predicament in the first place.
~ “If I get in trouble, I’ll yell. If I come out with memory loss, you’ll know.”
~ There was the standard ‘I’m Batman, and God help you if you screw up’ that Kyle had received ... well, every single time Batman looked at him to be honest. Now Kyle was receiving the ‘You have screwed up, so I will now demonstrate that the whole reason for that ‘no killing’ policy was to show in explicit detail to screwups like you how creative I can be’ Look.
~ “Why am I here?”
“The presiding judge revoked your licence to practice law for a year after the Wrecking Crew barged into court during that divorce case, and this job was the only one available?”
“Do you know what ‘rhetorical’ means, Derek?”
“We here in Arkham prefer literal statements of our reality, ma’am. It prevents us from being infected with the worldview of the inmates.”
~ “Derek, tell whoever’s in charge of Mr. Tetch’s therapy that he needs a girlfriend. Stat.”
“The budget doesn’t allow for miracles, ma’am.”
~ “Are you in the basement again?”
“It’s a Cave, Mom. A subterranean fortified headquarters designed for the express purpose of fighting the criminal element.”
~
“The lock is in the back. You have to put your arm in there to reach it.”
“And I assume something thoroughly painful will happen if I have the wrong key?”
“You lose the arm.”
“Splendid,” Remus growled.
~
“Mermaids appreciate crackers. It is terribly difficult to make them underwater you know.”
~ Harry said something inappropriate then, but fortunately his head of house could not hear him over her own expletives.
~
“I was going to say goodbye in case I die on Monday. No. I can’t tell you what I’m doing, but if I die I just wanted to say that I think you’re the most beautiful girl in the entire universe and that I’ll miss you. If I die. Or if I turn into some sort of headless puss-oozing slug or something, I suppose it’s about the same thing, really.”
~
“Can someone explain what’s going on?” Neville asked. “Slowly?”
~
“A friend just tried to smuggle in nail-clippers. Interpol is all over him. They think he might be the head of a clipper smuggling syndicate.”
~ “If I’m going to tease you, I should also be nice at times. That way you’ll be more confused,” she explained.
Harry just shrugged helplessly. “I’m not smart enough to figure out girls. No one is.”
~
“This ponce is Voldemort?” Ron asked incredulously.
~
“She’s had a rough time of it, and anyone making things harder for her will answer to me.”
“And after that, Fred and I will do things to them that Harry’s too nice to think of,” George added.
~ Neville seemed to be channelling his grandmother, and looked down his nose with extreme scorn at the students who did not meet his standards of acceptable behaviour. “Luna suggested it. She said if it intimidated me, it should work really well on others. It’s sort of fun, really, being on the other side of that.”
~
“You know that guy’s not human, right?”
“Sure. Don’t fret it, sweetie.”
“Well don’t blame me or Dana if he tries to eat your brains or something.”
“There will be no eating of brains,” said Teal’c.
~
“When you say evil lawyers,” said Daniel, “what’s your definition of evil?”
“Owned by various demonic forces, actively working to bring about the Apocalypse, that kinda thing.
~
“Hah! The vile excrement returns with more of his cow friends.” She turned and shouted over her shoulder. “Numfar! Do the dance of Shame!” Further down the trail a distant figure began to caper jerkily.
“They’re paying customers, mom.”
Lorne’s mother turned again and shouted “Numfar! The dance of Capitalist Supremacy.”
~ “About all that we know is that they do speak English, and that they speak Russian with Ukranian accents when nobody’s around. But so far all that they’ve done is to say that they won’t talk and tell each other not to talk.”
~ “She came down with a bad case of ‘dead’, shortly after Voldemort’s fall.”
~ “Something like that rod, until you know exactly what it is, you don’t just smash it up or set fire to it or throw it into the sea. I’ve tried that sort of thing a few times now, more often than not it backfires; the smoke kills everyone it touches, or a tuna swallows the rod and ends up being eaten by the Pope who then dies horribly, or a hole opens and snatches your best friend to another dimension, that sort of thing.”
~
“He’s who he says he is. What he is I don’t know; what are they calling your outfit these days?”
“We’re a federal anti-terrorist task force. No name as such.”
~ The car drove off. Oz waved laconically at the driver, who tried to salute and nearly hit a trash can.
~ Oz heard her, despite the soundproofing, and sprang at the glass, which cracked but didn’t break. 
“That’s supposed to be bulletproof,” complained Grissom. 
“Well, he isn’t shooting it.”
~
“For that I’d guess they’d need my blood. It’s usually blood. Or my entire body, of course.”
~ “I’m not going to end up married and swept off to hell, am I? ‘Cause that’s what happened the last time a demon wanted me to sing.” 
~ “They were doing experiments on monsters instead of just killing them. They got eaten by monsters...” 
“Figures.” 
~
“Could I have your autograph?” 
“Provided you give me a lock of your hair and some nail clippings, so that I can return your spell threefold when you try to enchant me.” 
~ “If I turn around and you look like my dead wife I promise you that whatever I finally do to you will last twice as long and be three times as nasty as it needs to be.” 
~ “Agent Finn,” said one of the men, pointing to himself, then, “my wife, also Agent Finn, better call her Sam.”
~
“I read the instructions, and the ritual looks pretty good, right up to the point where the spell summons a really angry goddess. After that the procedures for keeping her contained and under control are... well, I’d have to call them inadequate. Laughable. Wouldn’t confine a teeny little demon, let alone a god.” 
~ “Looks like it. Narrows it down to Chk’k’k’ftg or Vod.” He clicked his tongue for each of the k’ sounds in Chk’k’k’ftg.
“I’d go for Vod. I can pronounce that.” 
~
“They made bail after flying a helicopter gunship attack in Los Angeles?”
“Well, they did have a leading law firm representing them. Us, apparently.” 
~
“He regained his soul and lost the chip in his head, was killed and came back as a ghost, finally became corporeal again a few months ago.” 
“There was a time,” said Catherine, “when a story like that would have phased me a little.” 
~
She tried to rob a bar in Quantico, but didn’t realise that most of the customers were marines and Special Forces from the base there.
~ “You stole the Sultan of Brunei’s personal key card?”
“Borrowed. He seemed the best bet; he wasn’t as alert as his bodyguards.”
~ “You’d be one of the clones, right?”
“There is only one Lex Luthor!” he said emphatically.
“Clone,” they nodded in unison.
~
“Say goodbye to your...” He seemed to stumble on the word. He looked to Shem. “Pentagon.”
~
“If you will excuse me, I need to talk to...” His eyes swept the room, looking for someone he knew - anyone he knew.
~
“What have you been doing for the last three days?”
“I’ve been dead. What did you want me to do?”
~
“This doesn’t make sense! Where did she go? Why was she here? Why is time not imploding on itself?”
~
And she glared at him. Glared with the glare of a thousand suns, trying to make him spontaneously combust under the heat of her gaze.
~
“Besides, I trust Ianto’s professionalism. He can think you’re cute and still shoot you. Can’t you, Ianto?”
~ “She may not be dead but how am I supposed to know what your laser gun or whatever has done to her? She might have hot chocolate for blood or think she’s a mushroom! That would sound great when I took her home. Oh, hi Jackie, bit of a problem, Rose thinks she’s a fungus, but otherwise everything’s all right?!”
~
“I was simply explaining to them that in some cultures a kiss showed you had the most honourable of intentions.”
“So that’s why that poncy Duke followed me around all night, demanding to show me he had ‘honourable intentions’.”
~ “I’m afraid to ask what it means. He’s probably going to try to explain it with several other sayings and proverbs which I’m likely not going to be able to understand either.”
~ “No hovering. No standing behind me scaring everyone off. No blue-eyed Glares of Doom from across the room. No taking friends of mine out back and ‘convincing’ them that I’m off-limits.”
~ He can’t quite bring himself to write I love you in a language anyone can read.
~
He’d crawled around under the console, asking for tools she’d never heard of and swearing in a language she couldn’t understand.
~ “It was on sale. In retrospect, I should’ve wondered why.” She flounced on the cushion experimentally once or twice; it stubbornly refused to be comfortable. “I think my spine’s straightening. It’s either that, or breaking.”
~ “Are you crying?” he demanded, hearing more sniffing sounds from the other end of the line. “You stop that right now.”
~
He hoped the delay was actual ‘mechanical difficulties’ and not just another way of saying ‘someone looked shifty so LAX is in lockdown’
~
His even more carefully cultivated reputation as a first class bastard was being systematically torn to shreds under the landslide of ‘Oh, cookies!’ and the frankly disturbing noises being emitted by hoards of ravenous NCIS agents and staff. It had to stop.
~
“Magic.” he said in a flat tone of voice, and she silently cursed him for being so in-control, even now. She couldn’t tell what he was thinking, whether it was ‘placate the crazy person until I can call the psych ward for vacancies’ or ‘please let one of us be hallucinating, and by us I mean you’. Then again, for all she knew, it was the ‘this is what smoking that funny weed does to young people’ tone of voice. She couldn’t delude herself into believing it was the ‘I know all about the demon nightlife, it just surprises me that you do, too’ tone.
~ Well, technically, it was actually her fourth day, but she didn’t think the first three counted, as she’d spent them alone in an empty office, watching training videos and reading over the fifteen bajillion confidentiality statements she had to sign.
~ He still didn’t know if they were dating or broken up…or if they’d even been dating in the first place – Abby hadn’t been really clear on what they were, and he’d given up trying to figure it out.
~ “Should I leave?...Are you sure? Your face is all pinched up – and you’ve got your ‘I can kill you and they’ll never find the body’ look.”
~ “Of course I’m sure,” he replies, sounding annoyed, and wrenches the door open, right in the face of a very angry-looking alien. “Or not. Yes, in fact, I’m not.”
~ “Did you find my sonic screwdriver?” he asks, because that is clearly the most unimportant question at the moment.
~ “You don’t have to go yet. Let’s go blow up that government building tomorrow and then have tea and biscuits.”
~ “I could say you’ll get used to him. But it would be more accurate to say, you’ll get used to tolerating him.”
~
“The last thing we need is our Doc out of commission. I’ve a funny feeling we’re going to need you when this is over.”
Simon made a face. “I love your optimism.”
“That was me being optimistic,” the Captain drawled. “You don’t want to hear what my pessimistic side’s saying.”
~
“Normal? Normal is for boring stamp collectors. We’re interesting.”
“Interesting is just another word for weird.”
“We’re not weird, we’re special.”
“Do you have a giant thesaurus in that overcoat of yours?”
~
Ten years with the Doctor had taught her that spoons are not just for eating. You can play them like musical instruments and if you’re very patient, you can even override a force field, if you’re careful.
~
“You give kidnapping-surviving presents?” Sara clarified.
“We’re throwing a kidnapping-surviving party,” Buffy pointed out.
~
They were trying to hack into the other’s system, whilst simultaneously bolstering their own defences. Other than that, all he could tell you was that it involved a lot of typing and cursing. It had ended up in of a draw when his system began an automatic shutdown, and the computers (three of them) that she had been working on all spontaneously burst into flames. They were still trying to explain that one.
~ “Are you planning to take over the world?…Plotting to destroy the world?” 
“How would I fish if I did that?”
“You’d go to another dimension. Are you planning on starting some form of apocalypse?”
“Not high on my list of priorities, no,” Jack told him.
“Well then so far the day’s looking pretty good,” Oz told him.
~ “I’m betting that the other minions knew that they were going in circles and didn’t say anything for fear of getting killed.”
~
“Why did you let him in?” Max asked Logan.
Adam answered again. “‘Cause I’m one the few people who really appreciates his collection of expensive beers.”
“And since he’s consumed them all, he’s just about to leave,” Logan said.
~ Usually he wouldn’t have gone for the kill, but the crazy son of a bitch had actually tried to bite him, so all bets were off.
~
Spike really hated portals. Portals were crap. They never took you anywhere good. You never got sucked through a portal and ended up in a land of beautiful leggy virgins with a thing for guys with cold hands.
~
“We’re going to watch the security tape from the bank now, and it would be nice to know if there’s anything you would like to tell me about why it caught you hitting Mr. Castelios in the arm with an axe.”
“Would you believe self defence?”
~ “And what’s out job for the day?”
“Make sure that the people working on the top secret project on the left side of the hall don’t get lost on the way back from the bathroom and end up seeing what’s going on with the top secret project on the right side of the hall.
“And try to find a better route to the bathroom than the one that takes fifteen different right turns and twenty minutes.”
“And to try to convince that pretty redheaded civilian worker that I do have honourable intentions.”
“Gotta be pretty good with a poker face for that one Harris.”
~
“His nose met my fist. Twice, it wasn’t properly introduced the first time.”
~ Robert Makepeace swore, turned on his heel and kept on cursing. Faith chuckled, “I’m impressed.” Robert switched to Russian and continued his creative tirade. “As am I,” said Giles.
~ “Was that an ‘oops, I just broke the ugly glass thing needed to avert the next apocalypse,’ or an ‘oops, I forgot to pick up his clothes from the dry-cleaners like I promised?’”
~ “I don’t know what is more disturbing. The fact that I can go read my autopsy report on her computer or the fact that our government’s entire security system was compromised by someone who was just after an autopsy report.”
~
“I grieved for you.  I felt pain,” she put her hand to her chest looking deeply troubled, but then her haughty demeanor returned and her eyes narrowed.  “I did not like it.”
“I’ll try to avoid dying again.”
~
Ducky brings pie—ostensibly from his mother, so Tony avoids it even though it looks delicious, because Ms. Mallard thinks that he’s an Italian gigolo furniture mover and Tony wouldn’t put poison past her
~
“As far as I can tell, Mr. Jackson is a bit of a hero.”
“Oh, for crying out –” Jack ran a hand through his hair. “What did he do?”
Brow furrowed in confusion with such a response, Dr. Langer paused a moment. “Well… Daniel was shot during –”
Jack sighed. “Of course he was.”
~
“In case you didn’t notice, he was trying to chop off my head. Friends don’t do that usually!”
~ “Why were you shooting at us?”
“That was you? I thought you were a deer!” 
“Well, that’s a new one.”
~ “It’s just a soap opera,” Robin said. “It’ll be on again tomorrow and nothing will have happened.”
~ “What if it’s not a date? Just two co-workers having dinner. It might be candlelit, but I can’t really help that.”
~
“Alfred hit me. With a polo mallet.”
“Is that the official story?”
“It’s less embarrassing than the truth.”
“Which would be...?”
“I was working under the car and sat up too fast.”
“Really.” Her tone was filled with doubt.
“You’re disappointed! You’d rather I’d been clobbered by a thug, or hurled through a twentieth story window, wouldn’t you?”
~
“Less than twenty-four hours and I already want to murder her. Maybe a little background check will give me a legal reason to.”
~ “I’m afraid the local police and I had a small difference of opinion over my method of conducting a motor vehicle.”
~
“An intriguing dinner choice, but beer isn’t known for its vitamin content.”
“Don’t care. Too tired to chew.”
~ “I told her I wasn’t going.”
“And this would have been just before I’d told her I’d get a ride down with you. You can see where there might be a little confusion.”
~
“And then they’ll slice me open like a drunk in a bar-fight.”
“We usually refer to it as surgery. Also, maybe not such a good idea to be rude about surgeons right now.”

“I told you not insult the king. He’s very sensitive about his nose.”
“I didn’t say anything!” Jack protested.
“Sir, you laughed. And pointed.”
“Still, life imprisonment is a bit harsh, don’tcha think?”
~
“Before we start, can I get anyone anything – tea, biscuits, calming draughts?”
~ Xander was unimpressed, unamused even. To be frank, he was the sunny side of disgruntled heading straight towards the far depths of blood red rage that had been likened, on the three previous occasions he had gotten truly pissed off, to a thermonuclear device going off.
~
“Please. I could outrun the wind while sleepwalking.”
~ To his surprise, he woke up. Considering that the last thing he remembered was being chased by a dragon, this was unexpected.
~ “Six weeks ago, the Half-breed killed my apprentice and nearly released the Anti-Christ upon the earth. Forgive me for being suspicious.”
~ “As I was saying…” his voice deepened “I, AM THE METATRON. HERALD OF THE ALMIGHTY AND…oh, quit poking me Harris! I don’t get to meet new people very often.”
“That’s because you behave like this Al. You scare them off.”
~
“Are you threatening me, Mr Gunn?”
“Absolutely not, Mr Vogler. When I threaten people, I tend to do it with an axe. I’m a traditionalist that way.”
~ House shrugs. “I’m watching my patient turn into a werewolf. I think that should cut me some slack when it comes to the use of inappropriate humour as a coping mechanism.”
~
“So, if we need a block of C-4...” Buffy said.
“Or if we need a couple of illegal ingredients for a spell...” Willow said.
“And if we need a fire truck filled with holy water...” Xander asked.
“I’ll get the truck, you get the priest, and I’ll join you for the fight, because if you need a fire truck filled with holy water, I want to see it.”
~
“It’s a particuarly rare dialect of the Snanar, a demon clan that settled in Western Siberia around 1066 AD. A monk in the fifteenth century attempted to convert them to Christianity, and spent a good amount of time transliterating the Bible into their language. Didn’t work though. They, ah, sacrificed him on the Spring Equinox to ensure a good harvest. But the alphabet he rigged up is still in use today.”
~ “You say it’s sacred tradition to hold a banquet to honour your new allies, and then you promptly try to poison them?!”
~ “Check your line of sight. You don’t want to hit any of the girls.” Xander noticed the glares from the three sisters. “I mean the capable young women who are full individual in their own right… Also don’t shoot me. Or yourself.”
~ “Look,” the double began. ”It’s a long story.”
“So you’re what? Like from an alternate dimension or something?”
His double stopped. ”Okay, it’s a short story then. I’m here with some friends. Can we come in?”
~ “She faked her death and is in hiding…two blocks from where she used to work?”
~
“They sounded like they were speaking through a mouthful of evil rocks. So yeah, I’m going with demons.”
~ “Until we know what’s wrong with him and how it’s transmitted, we can’t afford to let him back among the general population.”
Xander blinked a few times. “And that’s bullshit doctor-speak for what now?”
“I’m curious about him and I have a perfectly legal excuse to keep him here.”
~
Hell, I thought Adelaide Wilson was dead. “Addie? You’re dead.” Apparently so did he.
~
“Listen to me. You do not want to do this.” She looks at me like I’m dumb. “Okay, maybe you do want to do this. You’ve actually put a lot of thought and planning into it. But, you’ve won, right? You lured him here, he didn’t have a clue you were behind it. Look at his face.”
~
I look at the C4, then at Blockbuster. What’s he want me to do, eat it?
~ “Besides, like you said, I was busy saving them from being ‘helplessly endangered.’ It wasn’t like I could ask whatever was trying to eat my head at the moment to wait while I covered their eyes.”
~
Harry froze at the unfamiliar voice. “You’re not Murphy.” Over in the corner he could see Bob’s eyes widen slightly in concern, and a sick, cold feeling started to work its way through Harry’s stomach. “What the hell are you doing with her phone?”
“Sir.” The woman’s voice turned infinitely more gentle, and he was suddenly sure he had never heard anything more terrifying. “I’m afraid I have some bad news…”
~ Feeling his hand wanting to curl into a fist, Harry closed his eyes a moment. Now was not the time to punch Murphy’s partner in the face. For one thing, Murphy would be pissed when she woke up and found out he’d done it….
~ He paused, then caught the tension still simmering in the air and looked back and forth between the two women. “This was one of those conversations I’m going to be really, really sorry I walked into, isn’t it?”
~ “I can’t hear anything, do you, Zack?” 
“I confess I haven’t noticed any unusual activity warranting a report.”
“You do realize she plans on murdering you now? And I never authorized anything this drastic?”
“I am completely out of line here, sir.”
“Goodman!” she called. “For God’s sake, make him put me down!”
“I’m sorry, but at the present moment I am reading something very important and cannot see any problems you can’t attend to.”
“I hate you all,” she muttered in defeat as Booth whisked her off into the elevator.
~
“Ah! Actually, the whole ‘You need backup’ thing wasn’t really a question. It was more of a statement…like: you need backup!”
~
“Dangerous? We laugh in the face of danger, don’t we guys?” O’Neill turned to his teammates for support.
“I wouldn’t say ‘laugh’ Sir!” Commented Carter, “Maybe smile resignedly.”
~ “Clark, if you’re looking for somebody to tell you that you’re not a hero, perhaps you should start with someone whose life you haven’t saved. Assuming, of course, that you can find one of those in the area.”
~ He knew, even as the words left his mouth, that his motives for asking the question could be misconstrued, so he concentrated on schooling his features into an expression that clearly conveyed that he had absolutely no vested interest in her answer.
~ “You realize that the only reason I’m even considering this is because the painkillers have turned my brain into oatmeal.”
“I like oatmeal. It’s good for you.”
~
“Spunk?” Dick echoed incredulously. “You have an IQ that hovers near 200 and the best you can come up with to explain why you love your wife is ‘she has spunk’?”
~
While anyone else might’ve had to wade through a chain of command, General Lane’s widow was immediately handed off to someone who could actually help her.
~
Quite a few of us thought that was just bit odd. Then there was the stench of pus I shall laughingly refer to as your ‘defense lawyer’ and ‘the prosecutor’, neither of which demanded you be dosed with veritiserum at a capital murder trial.
~ “You may have come up in a… very unnerving conversation,” Daniel admitted. “I understand you’re calling to threaten me?”
~ “You don’t have to worry about that yet. Spike won’t show me how to hot wire a car until I’m old enough to drive it.”
“And again, I’m not sure that’s as comforting as you intended it to be.”
~
“I take it then you’re not too big a fan of school?” Janet asked.
“Not so much with the fandom. We’re kind of more like foes,” she replied. “Mortal enemies, really. It’s all very dramatic.”
~ “They’re hoping she’ll do it again, aren’t they?” Daniel mused, almost to himself. “They think if they allow her access to classified information, she’ll discover other potential failures and assist them without them ever having to officially ask her for help.”
~
“So you’re not dying of curiosity?” she snorted. “Because your eyebrows say otherwise.”
“My eyebrows?” he asked, confused.
She nodded. “They’re all gloomy and thinky.”
“My… eyebrows,” he repeated disbelievingly.
“Are both gloomy and thinky,” she confirmed.
~ “Xander?” Dawn said, confused. “What are you doing with Spike’s cell phone?”
“Spike has a cell phone?” Xander said stupidly.
“That would be the little talking box in your hand, yeah,” Dawn said.
“Well what do you know?” he said, sounding bemused.
“And now that that’s covered, shall we get back to the question of why it’s in your hand?”
“It rang. Had to make the horrible noise stop,” he moaned.
~ “My brain and I decided to spend some quality time together. Much was considered. Decisions were made.”
~
“You’re sure this guy is treating you alright? He feeds you and doesn’t attempt to sacrifice you to any unpleasant demonic powers?”
~
“What could you possibly have enjoyed? The part where the airline lost our luggage, or the part where I had that bad sushi that first night and was sick for the next two days? Or how about that hotel room we got was so small and cramped, you had to sleep on the floor, which, if memory serves, you described as having the unique aroma of a wet llama?”
~
Lois glared at him. “I don’t need saving,” she stated through clinched teeth. Clark’s eyebrows rose in surprise as he looked from her face to the face of the man sneering at him from over her shoulder. “He has a knife,” he pointed out unnecessarily.
~ “You know, if you happen to be harboring any illusions that I think you’re perfect, I’d be happy to dispel them for you!”
“Thanks,” he replied dryly. “But, you know, I’ve somehow never quite managed to delude myself that much.”
“Are you sure? Because I’ve got a whole list of reasons in my head, and I can list them off alphabetically, if you like.” Her unholy glee at this prospect made him wonder if she didn’t actually have such a list.
“You know, as great as that sounds, I don’t think –”
“Chronologically it is, then,” she said, interrupting his protest. “First of all, you’re moody.”
~ “Sometime,” he mumbled quietly, “I’m just going to fall asleep, not get knocked unconscious. I swear, sometime it’s going to happen.”
~
He could talk to birds in their own languages, for example, something she could never have done, since her ancestors were notoriously tone deaf on both sides of her family.
~
He used to head out into the street until the rhythms of the local language seeped into his skull and began to make some kind of sense.
~
He didn’t know how anyone could forget war. “You forget because you don’t want to remember, so you ignore it, until it fades away.” 
~
“Voice authorization Robin, Alpha One. Confirm.”
“Confirmed. Accessing. Stand by.”
“So,” his father scowled, “how long is this going to—”
“Specifications accessed and scanned. Interface protocol ready.”
Jack blinked. “Okay, then.”
~
“It’s just a very specialized DSP.” Everyone just blinked at him, blank looks on their faces. “Digital Signal Processor. They use them in those big plastic helmets you can buy that make you sound like Darth Vader.” A chorus of affirmative noises rose up around him.
~
“Holy fucking shit,” Agent Maad rumbled, the first to find his voice. “I can’t believe it... no, wait, yes I can. Shit.”
~
“I think I speak for all of us when I ask: what the hell just happened? You all look like your brains are about to shoot out your ears, and for a second there I thought you two were about to have synchronized cardiac arrests. Not fun to watch.”
~
“The identity under which she adopted him was created months before. Likely a combination of bribery, magic, hacking, and identity theft.”
~
“Whoa, wait a second. You said this bastard died,” Vic cut in. “Then what the hell’s going on?”
“Hell froze over,” Greta looked up at them, eyes red and absolutely flaming with anger. “I’m sure you remember.”
Vic’s human eye blinked once. “Yeah. You mean he was involved with that? Shit.”
~
She’d always had faith in God, sometimes it was all she had, but Tim had just confirmed the existence of the Devil and Hell with all the gravity of someone giving directions to the closest post office. 
~
“She’s not the one that’s been trying to kill us. For now, I think I’ll spend my time loathing and fearing the guy who is,” he growled.
~
“You’ve grown, Garfield. Sometimes I wonder if perhaps you aren’t one of the most sensible of all of us. I wonder how that happened.”
He grinned. “Hey, a guy can’t keep going on his overpowering charm and dashing good looks forever.”
~
“We asked you to find out something pretty sensitive about someone who doesn’t have a stain on his character, you handled it pretty well.” 
“What if I’d come in with a hundred-page dossier and proved it beyond all doubt?” 
“Then we would have congratulated you and sent you on your way, shredded and burned the report, and never given you a job that allowed you to come into contact with critically sensitive material.” 
~
“Finally, you obnoxious little reference text! I can’t believe you kicked up such a fuss...” The book, apparently taking offense to this, blew a raspberry and proceeded to call him a wide variety of names, some of which Harry hadn’t even heard of, in a high-pitched nasally tone.
~
But all these letters were growing exponentially; by the time Harry got back home, he wouldn’t see anyone for the first few days; they’d all be smothered under the letters he had written them.
~
“And she also said to inform you that you have an hour to get to Hogsmeade before the shops close down.”
“The shops…?” he repeated slowly, then swore and rocketed out of his chair, scrambling out the door and clattering down the stairs.
~
“Doe was a darned nice guy,” said Leo, “for a homicidal megalomaniac.”
~
“You’d think there’d be another line of work he could try. It’s my impression that ‘criminal mastermind’ is a crowded field in Metropolis.”
“Don’t ask me,” said Leo, “Hank’s family wanted him to be a dentist.”
~
“The agricultural secretary spent a couple of days there last year. Of course it was only supposed to be four hours, the rest of the time he was tied to a giant exploding rutabaga waiting for Superman to rescue him, but...”
~
“They wanted to scan her to make a holographic disguise for Landry. He was going to try to use the thing about the prisons to get an appointment with you, then take your place. After that I think he wanted to replace the President.”
“What the hell for?”
“Superman doesn’t think they’d thought it through past that point. God knows why anyone in his right mind would want the job.”
~
As soon as it had landed a young sergeant ran to the helicopter, stooped low to avoid the rotor blades, saluted, and said “Colonel O’Neill?” 
Jack returned the salute, and said “Be awkward if I wasn’t.” 
~
“Is she all right?” It took Mal a moment to realize that Simon and Jayne chorused the words right along with him. Ai ya, but they were all turning into a bunch of mother hens over this baby thing...
~
He seemed to think that it didn’t matter what he said, Mal wouldn’t throw him off the ship. Mal wondered when, exactly, Simon had gotten so gorram good at reading him.
~
Mal Reynolds looked just the sort to shoot someone if he felt it was necessary. Maybe even if it wasn’t. The Doctor had been shot before. He really, really hadn’t enjoyed it. (Especially the bit with the morgue and the shroud. And the toe tag. That had not been one of his finer moments. He still wondered sometimes how that poor orderly had explained things...)
~
“She insists it’s important he come, and I don’t much care to argue with a girl who can beat me into a puddle of goo.”
Inara chuckled softly. “It’s never stopped you before.”
“Yeah, well, I’m tryin’ to acquire wisdom in my old age. Is it working?” 
~
The Doctor figured that if he could just bottle and distribute the aggressive cheerfulness that was Kaylee Frye, he might just have a shot at solving all the universe’s problems. Or, at the very least, making an ginormous fortune on the intergalactic drug market. Great stars, but she was a happy person.
~
“And she gave me a list of things to pick up that, according to her, she didn’t trust you to get right.”
Mal drew himself up indignantly. “Didn’t trust–! I’ve had that woman’s back for near on a decade, and she don’t trust me to pick up–” he hesitated. “What sorts of things?”
Inara gave him an arch little smile, and Mal knew he’d lost the argument. “Are you sure you really want to know?”
~
It wasn’t a very big wood. At least, not to a man who’d stood on planets where whole continents lay swallowed by forest. The Doctor admitted to himself that he might be a teeny bit prejudiced in that regard. But still–only ten or fifteen square miles? Barely a copse. 
It was, however, plenty scary. All tangled underbrush and shadowed secrets.
~
“Point for the big dumb monkey,” murmured the Doctor, careful to keep his voice low enough Jayne couldn’t hear it. Mal did, though, and quickly arranged his features into a careful not-smile.
~
“Lio coh jweh ji neong hur ho deh yung duh buhn jah j’wohn!” Mal winced. More Chinese profanity followed. The Doctor paused in his examination of the other corpse to listen with great interest, a grin tugging at his mouth. Ricky’s eyes got wide at the creativity and inventiveness of the insults. 
~
“Not talking about him means she’s in love? You know, there’s a reason men don’t understand women. You don’t make any damn sense!”
~
James was now both sulking and not speaking to Harry, which actually worked out very well, considering Harry was technically not speaking to him either.
~
Actually, he’d ended up completely wrong on this count, an annoying new trend for him.
~ She gritted her teeth. ‘He won’t leave me alone. What am I supposed to do with a man who won’t take a hint?’
‘You could knock him overboard,’ Jack suggested.
For a moment she looked tempted, then shook her head quickly. ‘No, I couldn’t.’
‘Do it quickly, no one will notice,’ he urged.
~
“Why didn’t she tell me?”
“She was probably inclined to think that it wasn’t your business,” Jack shrugged.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
“And spoil the fun?” Jack asked, looking shocked. “You obviously don’t know me very well, mate.”
~
“With you there’s always a catch. What is it?” 
Jack hesitated. Then he said, carefully, as if having to reveal this information pained him greatly, “The cave cannot be entered by the living.”
There was a pause. “Right, that’s it,” Will said, drawing his sword, “I’m going to kill him.”
~
“What the hell did you do?” Will demanded, his voice rough.
Linus, his own head pounding, groaned, “Magic, you twit!”
~ “It’s a fine thing. You hits me in the head wif an oar on Isle de Muerta, I hits you in th’ head wif an oar on Isla Cruces, and now I hits meself in the head wif an oar out in the open sea. Dangerous things, oars.”
~
“What?” Clark asked in surprise, echoing what her mind was saying – except his version didn’t include profanities.
~ “I was trying to say that you were right,” he added.
“Naturally,” she quipped. Then after a beat, “Right about what?”
~ “Where are you finding more dirt?” she asked in frustration. “Better yet, why are you putting it in your mouth?”
The five-year-old shrugged. “Tastes funny.”
~ “Who would have thought she’d fancy Jack? Strike that—everybody fancies Jack. You probably fancy Jack.”
~
On the rare occasions that Jack Sparrow’s path crossed their own (three visits, two quests, and half a dozen rescue missions), the flamboyant pirate taught him how to cheat at cards, pick locks and pockets alike, and, somewhat inadvertently, how to out-swindle the sneakiest of pirates, including Jack himself.
~
There follows a highly awkward discussion during which you manage to convince him that you did not willingly abandon Elizabeth, and your father apologises at least three times for killing the man.
~ “You haven’t aged a day,” you murmur into her hair. She sighs and melts into you, sounding fond and exasperated. 
“You don’t expect me to believe that, do you? I am in possession of several mirrors, and my eyes are perfectly functional.”
“Well.” You pull back and make a great show of inspecting her again. “Perhaps a few days. Perhaps as much as a week.”
~ “I believe in mermaids and the walking dead. But James Norrington giving you your due without it being extracted from him at knifepoint...” Jack shook his head and raised an eyebrow. “You’re quite sure he wasn’t drunk?”
“Quite sure.”
“Running a high fever?”
“Healthy as a horse.”
Jack blew a soft breath through the steam rising off of his tea, one sun-browned, fine-boned finger tracing the rim of the cup. “Possessed?”
~
“Nothing’s wrong. Well, not so much as wrong as…interesting.”
“My-what-a-good-book interesting, or bring-a-shovel-and-don’t-ask-any-questions interesting?”
Will considered. “Familiarize me with where on your scale Jack being in town to celebrate our engagement would fall.”
“It wouldn’t so much fall as plummet screaming out of the sky.” Her eyes widened. “Am I sensing this is not a what-if scenario?”
“One of the things I love most about you, Elizabeth, is your perceptiveness.”
“Good Lord, is he out of his mind?” Will opened his mouth, and she shook her head, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Don’t. Stupid question.” She stared as she absorbed the news, and after a moment a little laugh bubbled up out of her. “Jack’s here. Right now.”
~ She had to get them out of there before he started naming his imaginary grandchildren.
“That reminds me, Will. Did I tell you about the book I’ve been reading on conception methods?”
~ “I can’t believe you said that!” Apparently his faith in his own ears hadn’t improved since the third time he’d made this same exclamation.
~ “Well, he hasn’t drawn the navy down on the place,” Elizabeth observed. “That’s a good sign.”
“Assuming he stayed here even ten bloody seconds after I left,” Will muttered.
“I beg your pardon, whelp, but you sound suspiciously like you doubted my word.” Jack appeared at the bottom of the narrow staircase, arms crossed, leaning against the edge of the doorway. “Did I not say I’d stay here until you and your bonny lass returned? And here I stand, even if you did take a bloody eternity getting back. Of course, it did give me the opportunity to make amends with your donkey.”
~ It was the sort of day that dragged down mind as well as body. Which was unfortunate for Lieutenant Gillette, whose mind had trouble treading water on its best days. 
~ They had arrived at the docks before the ship carrying Will’s cargo had unloaded, and so had decided to do some wandering while they waited. “Decided” meaning that Jack had taken off on foot in a random direction, leaving Will the choice of going along or standing with the cart and horse like a useless dolt.
~
“Fine. Tell me your idea, Jack.” Similar words had probably preceded the destruction of Atlantis.
~
“So what’ve you got coming in? Smuggled weapons? Stolen jewels? Scantily-clad harem girls?”
“Harem girls, yes. I thought they’d make a nice wedding present for Elizabeth.”
“You know, Will, pleased as I am to see you honing your sarcasm to as fine an edge as the rest of your weapons, what say you point it in another direction?” Jack suggested, but his eyes glittered with amusement.
~ “Oh, you know, darling. Morning errands, trip to the docks, defacing other people’s property…”
“Technically, it’s my property that’s been defaced. Seeing as how I’m the one currently in possession of it.”
“Yes,” Will agreed, “because you stole it. It was someone else’s while you were defacing it.”
~ “Do you know what would be nice?” Elizabeth interjected, smiling pleasantly. “If you actually made it to the party you snuck into town to attend without getting shot. Wouldn’t that be lovely, Jack?”
~ “Yes,” Jack answered languidly, without opening his eyes. “I’ve drowned. Now go away. I’m indecent.”
“Truer words have never been spoken.”
~
From outside came the sort of laughter that suggested Will was no longer vertical.
~
“Trust you to have a humorous anecdote about getting flayed.”
~ “I said I’m going to see Elizabeth home, and then I’ll be right back. All right?” It was quite amazing, really, how Will could make two words as innocent as “all right” carry such a threat of wrath. 
“I shall try to entertain myself until your return.”
“Yes, that’s what worries me,” Will said dryly.
~
“You know, Bill, you write like a bloody girl,” he commented.
“Well, I thought of trying to do mine a bit more like yours, but I was afraid she would think it was a ransom note from some lunatic who just buried two bodies in his garden.”
~
It wasn’t easy to drain a glass of wine quickly around the mask’s beak, but it wasn’t impossible, either. And she had the motivation to perfect the technique. She contemplated her empty glass and considered using it to slit her wrists.
~ Elizabeth choked on her drink, and without ever casting an eye in the direction Will had spotted the danger, she pushed her glass into his empty hand, grabbed Jack by the wrist, and propelled them both smoothly into the spinning throng of dancers a few steps away.
“Well, I’m sure that didn’t look at all suspicious,” Jack commented cheerfully, matching their rhythm to the music’s.
“You would rather I pushed you through the nearest window, perhaps?”
~ “Worse,” Will echoed. “How much worse?” Jack took hold of Will’s elbow and started looking for an escape route. 
“Bad enough that we really should have been running before you asked me that question.”
~ Jack hated that look. It was the one that made him wish he had a list handy, headed Bloody Catastrophic and Unfortunate Shit that is in No Way my Fault, just in case Will tried to peg him with anything like the Black Death or the caste system or the invention of the pan flute. He especially hated that look when he had no idea why he was getting it.
~ Determined to track him down and find out exactly what disaster had been averted – God almighty, let it have been averted.
~ “I know what you’re thinking.” 
“How enlightened, given I don’t know what I’m thinking.”
“You think this is a stupid thing for me to be doing.”
Jack snorted, his own chains rattling where they hung against his thighs. “That isn’t a thought. It’s a fact.”
~
“I explicitly told you not to do anything stupid! How the bleedin’ hell that translated to ‘open your gob and get yourself flung off the port side by the homicidal mutineer’ I have no idea, and I speak twice as many bloody languages as you!” “It was actually the starboard side,” he corrected, lips twitching. “And I wasn’t so much flung as pushed.”
~ “Do you know what those men you have in your prison used to be, Commodore?”
Norrington smiled grimly. “Greater in number,” he offered, and Bill Turner let out a bark of knife-edged laughter.
~
“No sacrifice is too great for the child of me old friend Bill Turner,” asserted Jack. Then he frowned. “Leastways, some sacrifices may be too great, but as the nature of said sacrifices is at present unspecified I feel it’s a moot point. As it were.”
~
“What kind of pirate sits in your waters and lets you lob shells at his ship the whole live long day?” he muttered to himself crossly.
‘One who knows you can’t reach him,’ his mind answered quickly.
~
“Come, Lily. Apparently Mister Jacob wishes us to sever our friendship with Mister Mud Puddle and form proper new acquaintances with Mister Bathtub and Mister Soap.”
~
Ah ha! He’d always known he had good taste. It appeared he had kidnapped the daughter of the Governor of Jamaica. Excellent!
~ “Mr. Matelot,” said his captain, rolling his eyes and tilting his head with an air of long-suffering patience. “That was, if I am not mistaken, a door at one time. I do hate to sound redundant, but you do remember how to use one, do you not?” He waved a hand with casual elegance at the hanging splinters. “How many times do I have to tell you? First you take hold of the handle. Like this.” He demonstrated. “Then you turn the handle.” He turned it with exaggerated care. The door shifted ominously. “And voila!” He waved both arms in enthusiastic circles, smiling madly. “The door is open, and you can enter a room with none of this regrettable production of kindling.” The remains of the door clattered to the deck. The captain jumped back and eyed the wreckage accusingly.
~
“No harm. I’d ‘ave suspected me, meself.”
~
Jack only saw him now in flashes of Will’s expressions, or when he was extremely intoxicated. But that couldn’t be helped, because in those times he also tended to set fire to things, spend ridiculous amounts of gold on crates of bananas and weave tales about mermaids and witches and sea monsters.
~
“Of all bleedin’ - NO, we don’t want your ruddy fish!  Get away from us, you damn fool idiotic islanders!”
~
“You speak French?”
The dark look she gave him answered before she spoke.  “Not any polite French.”
~
“James!” Jack attempted to rise, but he abruptly sank back again, frowning. “I think m’ bones’ve melted.”
“Or,” said James, setting straight the empty decanter balanced precariously on the desk, “you could be utterly sozzled on my gin.”
“Gin,” echoed Jack wonderingly.
“Yes. Very expensive, imported gin at that. How on earth did you find it?”
~ “On his fortieth birthday, James Norrington, Commodore of his Royal Majesty’s Fleet, scourge of piracy in the Caribbean, was kidnapped by his two mutinous captains and bought here (this den of sin and Frenchmen), utterly and completely and horrendously against his will.”
“Oh, shut up, James, and have another drink.”
~
“We haven’t the freedom to pursue this at the moment, darling.”
“I’m asleep!” Jack said immediately. “Deeply asleep. I might be dead. Carry on.”
~
“Really, Dick, you shouldn’t have.” Bruce looked down at the copy of Mortal Ninjas: The Destructoid Saga IV he had just unwrapped.
“I know, I know. How did I pinpoint that one thing you desperately wanted yet wouldn’t buy for yourself?”
“Oh absolutely. You read my mind.”
“You know, down at the polo club they call me psychic Grayson.”
“And yet,” Bruce mused, flipping the case over to read the back, “I have the oddest feeling that I just unwrapped one of your gifts.”
“Bruce! Would I do such a selfish thing? I mean, sure it’s designed for more than one player, and sure you’ll need me to walk you through the very complicated opening levels, but I’m shocked, shocked, that you could accuse me of such crass selfishness.”
~
“You’ll notice I was a little more imaginative with my gift for Alfred.”
“Ah, right, Mutant Cheerleaders Attack X. Very appropriate for a man who prefers the Garden Channel to Cartoon Network.”
Dick threw up his hands despairingly. “You try to bring a little culture into people’s lives and do they appreciate it?”
~
“He said there weren’t no real fighters left on the ship. All the folks could be trusted with guns were s’posed to’ve gone into town!”
Xander blinked. “But I didn’t use a gun, what are you angry at me for?”
~
“Dearly beloved we are gathered here to join this man right here and this woman who is wearing the ugliest dress that I have ever seen in my entire life in Holy Matrimony which was instituted by God because he wanted to enslave us men into a life of purgatory and Hell with screeching children and only one woman whose job is to yell at us if we stay in the tavern with our fellow men for a little longer…”

“Well, since she wrote the letter…it’s been some days or weeks or….” Jack looked thoughtful and counted on his fingers. “We made a quick stop in Tortuga, at which point events ensued, unfolded and unavoidably delayed our departure for some time.”
“So she had the baby, but you don’t know when.”
~ “Jack, you can’t take all our rum. What would you do with three barrels anyway?”
“Well, mate, if you don’t know what to do with rum, then you don’t deserve to have any at all.”
~
Actually, with the exception of that damned light that was blinding her (Can dead people go blind?) and stabbing its way into her brain like a knife, making her wish she was dead (Ha, ha. Little corpse humor there, Lois.), death wasn’t half bad.
~
Was it too much to hope for a little silence? Apparently it was, as the voices only got louder and more insistent. In fact, they seemed to be talking to her, demanding something of her. They simply would not shut up! “…ming to…” she thought she heard, which made no sense at all. Though she suspected paying attention would only encourage them, she was annoyed enough to give it a shot. “…tor, I think you sho…” Well, at least a couple of those sounded like words, which was an improvement. Now, however, as she’d suspected, the voices were encouraged by her attention and grew – if possible – even more irritating in their demands. If she wasn’t mistaken, one even had the audacity to ask her questions, which was simply rude, if you asked her. Couldn’t a corpse get a little peace and quiet nowadays?

“Unca Jack said I could have rum when I’m twelve.”
“Uncle Jack may not live to see you turn twelve.”
~ “I do not know it you are entirely aware of this, Captain Turner but, one, it is very difficult to speak when dying and two, when someone shoves a sword into the chest cavity of another, it is generally considered to be a negative response.”

“If he asks you out, I’d want pictures, so I can frame them and put them on the mantle.”
“I think I’ll kill you now, slowly,” threatened Sam, “maybe with this spoon, even.”
Cameron put his hands up defensively. “I think you make a cute couple; him so handsome and you so - tall.”
“No criminal court or military tribunal will convict me.”
“Much as I’d love to see you carve out Mitchell’s vital organs, I have to tell you that it’s actually Cassie I want to invite to prom.”
~
“Only you, Erin. Only you can use words larger than two syllables after getting beaten with a metal pipe.”
She smiled softly, trying to ease his worrying mind, “And five syllables after getting tortured by a maniac with a god complex.”
~
“More like what didn’t happen. They went to an ‘uninhabited’ planet, left their back up at the gate and promptly lost contact. A few minutes later SG-3 watched an Alkesh fly off. An hour later, Ba’al shows up and says he has them and will trade for old camel-ass. Oh yeah, Dr. Lee let loose some plant that has quickly taken over level 19, and I locked up two trade delegates in the VIP quarters.”
~ “Rule one of espionage: it’s dumb to chain your getaway vehicle to a tree. Rule two: you? Are staying right here with the bike.”
~
“In.” The taller of the two thugs curtly gestured them toward a doorway with a card and keypad controlled lock.
“You know, you boys really need to work on your repartee,” he said, screwing up his face. “That monosyllabic thing... don’t get me wrong, it’s a classic, but the world expects a little more these days. A little back and forth, a little banter - people want to feel their thugs are engaged with the job, it’s not just another act of mindless violence to them.”
“In,” the man repeated, with no change in inflection.
“Of course, you’re a man who knows where his strengths lie, doesn’t mind the typecasting... I can respect that.”
~
He made to enter the lab, but Reynolds cut in ahead of him, much to his annoyance. Reynolds had been doing that a lot. Jack knew it was respect for his position rather than contempt for his skills, but it still sucked. He hung back while the science team did their gadget-filled version of casing the joint, although only because he was pretty sure there’d be an embarrassing incident involving him being shoved out of the way if he followed before the room was pronounced clear. Being the Man sucked.
~ “Can you read it?” Reynolds asked him. Jack gave him a long, hard stare, then made an elaborate pretence of examining his own clothing.
“Okay, did I accidentally swap clothes with Daniel in the locker room again?”
~ “Uh, you’re his-” he bit down on ‘father’ just in time, remembering Jon’s orphaned status, “...uncle?”
“Cousin,” the man corrected, nodding to himself. Then he pulled a dissatisfied face and let it smooth out again. “Removed,” he added. “Or... the other thing. Daniel?” He swivelled round.
Jackson blinked at being addressed. “Um. Well, he’s your... uncle’s grandson? So that makes you his-”
“Grandfather’s nephew,” O’Neill overrode him, smiling in smug satisfaction at having arrived at a term he was happy with. Jon’s goofy mannerisms, endearing in a teenager even when they were interrupting class, were somewhat disconcerting coming from a man whose age and bearing otherwise pushed all Ted’s ‘stand up straight and show respect’ buttons. Jackson looked mildly irked at being cut off, but recovered his smile quickly. “General O’Neill is... Jonathan’s closest surviving relative,” he explained. “So obviously, we’re very keen to get all this straightened out.” Jon’s whole family wiped out, right up to the grandparents? Christ. ...General?
~ “Is that your dad?” he blurted to Jon. The absolutely identical expressions of disgust this prompted made for decidedly mixed signals.
“There are not enough words for ‘no’,” the middle-aged Doppelgänger said, with a hand gesture that was totally Jon’s.
“He’s... a relative,” Jon explained, grimacing.
“Distant,” said the older O’Neill.
“Very distant.” They both nodded, and exchanged a dubious look.
~
The woman glanced across at him. “It may be that your...” her gaze flickered to Jamie... “cousin has been exposed to the same... technology you were, and it somehow caused an interaction.” Gee, that didn’t sound like it was edited for his ears at all.
“Smooth, Carter.” O’Neill clearly agreed with his assessment.
~
“It is conceivable that, were the two of them in physical contact and their brainwaves synchronised, the two populations would consider them to be a single entity and pool information. Should this occur, it is likely that part of the greater population would transfer into O’Neill’s body to provide more even coverage.”
“I touched his arm!” Jack protested. “We didn’t... rub brains.” He contemplated the obvious ‘on a first date’ joke, realised how incredibly icky that would be in context, and kept silent. Damn duplicates always complicated everything.
~
“He’s a General now?” he added incredulously.
“You didn’t notice?” Daniel said.
“I was a little preoccupied by the low-flying pigs. When, why, and what kind of recreational drugs were involved?”
~ “No,” snapped O’Neill, at the same time as Jon blurted “Non sum!” and Carter smiled and said “Essentially,” and Daniel said “Ah... in a sense.” A flurry of looks were exchanged between the four of them, and Teal’c raised a single eyebrow pointedly. It was the only contribution he had made to the conversation so far.
~
Daniel mentally filed that nickname under ‘things to inquire into further when Jack is very drunk’.
~ “Technically, he is not actually using any controls,” Zelenka piped up helpfully.
“Yes, because if he was, we could stop him.” 
~ “Tuas lumena obstra,” Jon muttered, nudging him out of the way.
“What? What does that mean?” McKay swivelled round to look at Daniel.
Jack stepped in before he could speak up. “He said, sure, you can’t use any of the standard sensor arrays to pick up a single gene, but, you can trick the scanners that look for viral contagions into accepting normal human parameters as a contagious disease, and then flag the ATA gene as a genetic weakness that makes people susceptible. Then you just intercept the quarantine instructions and that’ll tell you where to look for the gene carriers.” They all stared at Jack for a few moments. Zelenka turned raised eyebrows on Daniel.
Daniel quirked an eyebrow of his own Jack’s way. “He said, ‘you’re blocking my light’,” he reported neutrally.
Jack shrugged defensively. “It was in the tone of voice!”
~ “I can give you something for the headache, but I imagine you’ll have some residual sensitivity to noise and bright lights.”
“No blowing things up. Check.”
~ “Need I remind everyone that said machine had the delightful side effect of causing people to disintegrate?”
Carson’s eyes widened. “Disintegration? Nobody mentioned anything to me about disintegration.” Oh, no, it was just ‘come down here, Carson’, ‘activate this for us, Carson’... no one ever bothered to inform him he was putting his bloody life on the line.
“Oh, please. It’s untested Ancient medical technology. What part of doing horrible things to your innards wasn’t implied?”
~
John pointed a stern finger at him. “Hey. People who’ve mysteriously lost their ability to speak English do not get to volunteer.” Zelenka muttered something in Czech he was sure wasn’t complimentary, while the kid gave him an alarmingly dead on version of the ‘How would you like to be a Lieutenant again, Sheppard?’ stare.
~ “We could be Goa’uld.” He pulled a dissatisfied face as he exchanged looks with her. “Why did we not think of that at the planning stage?” 
“See?” O’Neill spread his hands and smiled. “How can you argue with that? And hey, Teal’c’s a Jaffa. He can’t even be made a Goa’uld.”
“A useful distinction but not, alas, a correct one. In fact, O’Neill, since I no longer possess my symbiote, it is entirely possible for-”
O’Neill narrowed his eyes. “Way to give away the home team advantage, T,” he accused. He turned to the freed prisoners. “Look. We’re not Goa’uld. You can tell this from the fact that we’re rescuing you. The SGC isn’t compromised. This is a rogue group captured by Baal - we didn’t even know they were still alive. In fact, would you believe that we’re here on an entirely unrelated matter?”
“No,” Doctor Weir said simply, but the wry twist to her mouth suggested she was beginning to be persuaded. Truly, there were few things that resembled the posturing of the Goa’uld less than a typical conversation with O’Neill.
“Exactly!” He shrugged. “If we really were the bad guys, we would have come up with a story that sounded much less stupid.”
~
He’d had worse. Jack had seen him take worse. Jack had given him worse.
~ Okay, now Daniel was pissed. Not just, ‘a Goa’uld broke my fingers’ pissed, although, okay, that wasn’t bringing him floods of joy. Not just, ‘I now have more muscle mass than anyone else in this room and yet? Still the Goa’uld’s first choice of hostage,’ pissed. No, this was a special kind of stomp-your-feet-and-jump-in-a-circle-and-throw-a-tantrum-and-aaargh! kind of incensed that he could only ever be pushed into by one specific person. Or in this case, two specific people. “So let me get this straight,” Daniel said, ignoring Beckett’s attempts to strap up his broken fingers. “In the time allotted him for the express purpose of saving his life - and yours - before he got too sick to work, your clone has been building a Goa’uld remover.” He spat the words out one by one, precisely articulated verbal bullets.
Jack clearly couldn’t see what was wrong with that picture. “Well... yeah.”
~
“Sir, we’ve got marines covering all the exits. We close in behind him, and he’s trapped.”
Jack gave him a look. “Yes. Trapped. In the big room full of spaceships!” he said incredulously.
~ Beckett had reached that end of his rope where things like ‘tones appropriate for use with Generals’ no longer registered.
~
“I don’t actually know the name of his ship.” Then laughed, “But I probably wouldn’t be able to pronounce it anyway.”
“Ah, well, actually it isn’t hard, sir.” I found myself looking down at my fingernails.
“Really? What is it?”
“It’s the ‘O’Neill II’, Mr President, and technically it isn’t Commander Thor’s ship. It’s mine. I won it in a poker game a year or so ago.”
~
“I’m going to give Jack the Air Medal, John.”
“Umm, excuse me, sir, but I already have that one.”
~
“I like that last one. I can see just see as at Christmas Dinner with your family - ‘and this is Jim, the best thing that every happened to me.’”
~
“I have kind of a crazy idea.”
“And this is different from your usual ones how exactly?”
~ “You see-that’s what I just don’t get. Why does he want me back? Everything was going swell, then, wham-we must have him back. Why?”
~
“This is fun. Isn’t this fun, kids?” Jack positively beamed at his annoyed team-mates.
“Yes, Sir. And may I say, Sir, how much I appreciate the opportunity to sit with the women and embroider, Sir. I am grateful for the opportunity to hone my sewing skills. You never know when I might need them in a combat situation, Sir.”
~
“Jack had a punctured lung, as you realised at the scene, so he’s not up to much talking just yet.” His face broke into a grin. “Which pleases a lot of people here in Washington no end.”
~
“Sort of? How can you be sort of dead?”
~
“How do you know your plan is better? You don’t even know what my idea is.”
“Does your idea involve nudity?” 
~
“Funny,” he said, his voice an impossibly dry croak, “I was just dreaming of electric sheep.”
~
He scratched absently at the IV line. “Pete, you want to go ask one of the nurses what they’ve got going into me here?”
“No. Because I know you. And if they tell you, you’ll start trying to figure out whether or not you actually need it, and you’ll probably decide that you don’t, and I don’t want you ripping out your IV line and going AWOL AMA.”
~
“He isn’t sexually frustrated!” I told her desperately. “He’s just the normal kind of frustrated! Because we frustrate each other!”
“Yes, yes,” Victoria said with a dismissive wave of her hand. “Sexually.”
“Platonically!” I yelped.
“Oh, please,” she said, rolling her eyes. “There’s no such thing as platonic frustration.”
“Oh, really?” I asked, getting a bit irrational. “Then perhaps I should be worried about what’s going on between the two of us right now!”
“Oh, Auriga,” Victoria sighed, in the same voice she used with her less gifted students, “Don’t attempt to convert to lesbianism just so you can escape from your feelings for him.”
~ Except then she fell quiet very abruptly, and her expression shifted from all crafty and mischievously amused to freakishly kind and understanding in around two seconds. I knew at once that she wasn’t to be trusted. I’d seen that transition on her face before, and it had resulted in a double date with her twin brother Lester who, interestingly, possesses no qualities remotely like hers, and instead only the misfortunate attributes of a man whose ears are twice as big as a normal person’s and who has known a lifetime of adversity thanks to the fact that his first name more or less rhymes with his last.
~ “No,” I said as convincingly as I could. Apparently it wasn’t very, because his eyes lit up in an especially cruel and nasty way.
“Something compels me not to believe you,” he announced.
“Well, if you’re not careful, something’s going to compel me to shove that mop down your throat, you stupid greasy idiot.”
~
On that last morning Elizabeth had resigned herself to the fact that she had to either die there, or begin the hike to the town on the other side of the cliff wall. Dying was looking uncommonly appealing.
~
“Well, then come,” she orders. “Because the only way you can inconvenience us is by not coming. Otherwise, you’re ininconveniencing us. And you know what they say about inconveniencers!”
“No,” he responds wryly. “What do they say?”
“Something ominous and catchy,” she responds after a moment’s faltering. “It probably even rhymes.”
“How intimidating,” he observes.
~
“I’m just thankful to have had a bit of peace and quiet. He’s been singing The Ramones all day in protest. Under other circumstances, I’d feel compelled to join right in, but I suspect one isn’t supposed to partake in singalongs with their hostages.”
~
“I believe the key may be to attempt some sort of spell that plays upon the caster’s will. Ideally, I would be able to will Spike to comply.”
“Was that what you were working on?” she asks.
“Attempting it,” he responds, frowning a bit. “I resulted in making myself a bagel with cream cheese…in my defense, I did want one.”
“One step in the right direction, then,” she observes with a smile.
~ “True,” Giles concedes. “And thank you for opening that whole new portal of highly disquieting possibilities.”
~ Kelly snaps, the indignant fury in her voice only heightened by the angry slap of rain against pavement. It’s like she’s enlisted the universe at large to team up with her in her angry tirades against him now.
~ “I just realized,” Kelly responds, in that tone she gets when she wants to convince him why it is really super important for them to watch E! News every single night, “right in the middle of worrying about my hair – we’ve totally never kissed in the rain!”
Yeah. He should have guessed. It’s like he keeps forgetting lately that she’s out of her mind. It turns out that all he can say is “Seriously?”
“Yeah, seriously!” she exclaims, and if he weren’t standing in the rain without an umbrella, he would almost be forced to admire how much she believes this is actually remotely sane.

Shortly after that, Norrington found a cat in the wreckage of a ship. It was a bizarre spectacle- the ever proper, meticulously dressed and powdered first mate clutching a bedraggled cat to his brocade coat- but he no one dared laugh. Will raised an eyebrow.
“It fears death,” Norrington replied crisply, drying off its long wet fur with his handkerchief.
“Of course. I suppose you asked it that yourself?”
~
“I feel that I should promote you, James,” Will remarked, glancing between Norrington and the cooing children.
“To what?” Norrington asked.
Will was silent. “… Good point. I can see why you rose so easily in the ranks, then.”
~
“Nom de Dieu, how on earth did you get here? Why are you here? Do you remember?”
“We followed maps. I know it’s a foreign concept to you, Gillette, but modern science has made such leaps and bounds. We have portable pictures on paper that represent actual geographic landmarks. Been sampling your family’s famous French wines, dear son of a merchant?”
~
“My father used to own a vineyard in Provence and now he is a wine merchant.” He paused in the middle of pouring a second glass. “Or is it ‘was’? Grammatical structures become very confusing when one is dead.”
“You have an eternity to discover the correct conjugation.”

It was undignified for Superman to yelp, he had to remind himself severely as he made a desperate grab for her hand before it travelled too far south.
~ “I may have…tripped once or twice when you were lucky enough to be there to catch me, but I never swooned.”
~
If he heard the name Lothario in that tone one more time, he was going to be vomit. Violently. (Of course again, that would mean more time in the Hospital Wing, so he manfully controlled himself.)
~
“It’s a big deal because you want to marry me - not because you come riding in on a white horse or even riding a jackass when you do it.”
Jim did a double take. “Did you just say jackass?”
“I believe I did,” she replied.
“I never considered the option of riding in on a jackass.”
~
“Don’t worry. If I’m called in, you’re driving me anyway, so you can glare them all into submission for me while I fix their problems. Ok?”
~ With a strangled squeal of abject terror, he turned and scrambled up onto the deck, tripping up the stairs in his haste. Will followed him at a more leisurely pace, not bothering to pull the sword from his back.
~
‘‘Tom Riddle,’ Harry imagined one of the stuffy Purebloods sniffing. ‘We followed around some Half-Blood fool named Tom Riddle?’ Another indignant sniff. ‘Not even Thomas Riddle? Of all the nerve!’ Of course, said stuffy Pureblood would have the name Ignatius McGunty Flibbertygibbit III, or some such.
~
He slowly pulled the subdued book out of his pocket, and the watching books all fell still, obviously waiting to see what would happen to their fellow book. Then, in a moment of idiotic bravado, Harry bared his teeth and clutched the book possessively rather than gently place it on one of the stairs. “Mine.” And the books charged.
~
Then he paused, mouth gaping open with his eyes wide. Was Collins really being attacked by an army of high-pitched books? On legs?
~
“Adding the word ‘hell’ to your inquiries will not make me answer, Pettigrew.”

Jon was sure that that particular shade of red indicated a dangerously high blood pressure. He would have commented on it, but found that he liked his head firmly attached to his shoulders.

“Attention in the Squadron. Until further notice, God may not contradict any orders given by the Training Instructors. God must contact the Chaplin’s Office directly to request a change of orders. Contact Chaplin’s Office for details.”

“Attention in the squadron. All trainees are to make the following change in their ATO, page 15. Insert the following into the diagram for Chain of Command, above Trainee and below Training Instructor – all creation, including dirt. Contact CQ for details about this change.”

“There aren’t any rules except the ones you made up!”
“Somebody has to make up the rules,” Robert said condescendingly, “and part of my rules is that you have to know the password.”
“That’s a stupid rule.”
“Hey now, let’s not start insulting my rules or I’ll have to start insulting your ridiculous hair and it’ll become a slippery slope of meanness.”
~
“Is this yet another way to get people to pay attention to you? Run out of dead people to frame and fellow students to hex?”
“Yes, that’s it! Without those options, running into professors seemed like such a solid plan!” Harry said angrily.
~
“I’m not crying,” Will insisted, with his head pillowed in his arms.
“Of course not,” Norrington replied mildly, “And I, secretly, have been conducting a passionate affair with Captain Jack Sparrow.”
“You don’t want to do that. He’s got the breath of a donkey with halitosis.”
~
“And I did think… I did hope that, since we- that you-”
“Are you trying to very awkwardly ask me if I will be your friend?” he asked, trying to keep the sarcasm from his tone. Saying ‘no’ would be like kicking a puppy. 
~
“Lots of people don’t like me. I worry about the ones with guns, not the ones with pens.”
~
Of course, she’d learned her lesson, and she’d never, ever do such a stupid thing again. That comment stretched the truth to an extent that was almost beyond even her capabilities, and she was surprised she they didn’t call her on it immediately.
~
“No,” she replied, letting loose a string of curses that he had to respect for their creativity.
“I do not think that that is anatomically possible but I shall, in all things, do my best to obey.”
~
“Uh, I think you doth misquoted,” Jon remarked casually, then held up his hands when the tip of the sword was placed at the hollow of his throat, “Of course, if that’s the way you want to say it, who am I to argue?” 
~
Teal’c raised one eyebrow at the pair sitting beside him. They were hysterical again, leaning on each other and muttering things that, mercifully, no one but them could understand. Then he looked at me. “This is why I do not consume alcoholic beverages.”
“Good reason.”
~
“Well, sir, she is a force to be reckoned with.”
O’Neill’s eyes clouded. “You ended that sentence with a preposition.”
“I won’t do that again, sir.”
~
“I’m told that he chose to sing rather than count his way through the anaesthetic, his last words being “I think I’m a banana tree!””
~
“You appear to have sprung a leak, sir. You’re smearing blood all over my ship, and I don’t appreciate it.”
~
“Can you tell me why you had a sharpened piece of wood on you, when the police found you in the alley?”
“It’s my whittling stick. I whittle. I find it relaxing.” Xander calmly said.
“We found over a dozen similar pieces in your car.” Brass noted.
“I relax a lot. I have stress. It’s a killer you know.”
“Each one sharpened to a needle point with hand grips carved in. You could do a lot of damage with those. You know I’ve seen hundreds of jury rigged weapons, these have got to be the best crafted of any of them.”
“Well, I don’t like to brag, but I do good work.” Xander said modestly.
“Then there was the axe in the trunk.” Brass said.
“It’s my whittling axe. Got to carve those sticks somehow.”
“With an axe?”
“Yup. It’s more challenging that way.”
“And the crossbow?”
“You wouldn’t buy it’s for whittling, would you?” He asked with a grin. “I’m in the William Tell appreciation society. I was meeting the member with the apples when this whole thing happened.”
“So you don’t want to explain the axe or the crossbow to me?” Brass demanded.
“That depends. Do you have any unsolved axe murders or arrow shooting victims you need to solve?”
“No.”
“Is there anyone who will say I used the axe or crossbow in any way which could be considered illegal?”
“No.”
“Then I don’t really feel like explaining them.”

But no one’s ever said ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘graciously accepts help’ in the same sentence.

“It’s not often that we have to go through official channels to avert an apocalypse. This business with security checks and top security stickers slapped on books that have spent decades sitting on my coffee table is disconcerting, to say the least.”

“Invisibility ray? Did it actually make matter translucent, or did it merely cause light to bend around them?”
“Don’t know. It did make a python turn into tapioca, but that’s got nothing to do with the current situation.”
~
“Okay, then, permission to go on a crazy adventure granted. Have fun, play nice, and I expect daily reports.”
~
“Oh, it’s not your fault, mate. It’s no use apologizing for things that aren’t your fault.”
“Quite right, of course,” the Doctor agreed. “Sorry.”
~
“Z-Y-F-F-E-R-L doesn’t spell anything.”
“Yes, it does. It spells ‘zyfferl’. I thought everyone knew that.”
“It’s not a word. Use it in a sentence, then.”
“‘The zyfferl was used in a purely ceremonial fashion during the last of the Kvyetvahnic Peregrinations of the Scarlet Junction, owing to the depletion of stores at the hands of the Sontaran Battle Fleet after the Siege of Ruth’ven Aanerthougsi’ix’pajhet in the Pansil System.”

The interview with Rose’s parents yielded little more than the conviction that her mother might just be able to take Martha’s mother in a cage match, and not many women could boast that.

“I am called Nil, a name not worthy of being spoken in the presence of Her High and Shiny Exaltedness. I am but a humble supplicant of the Grand and Pulchritudinous One, the . . .”
“You’re an obsequious little toady of Glory’s,” Angel interrupted.
The demon positively beamed. “The Eminent Angelus is too kind.”
“What does she want? Why are you here?”
“She Who Embodies Perfection entrusted this unworthy servant only with the information necessary to complete his mission. I cannot—”
The next thump knocked a piece of the drywall out. “You’ll say, or you’ll bleed.”
“Well put, O Forceful One.”

“And that boy’s standing there screaming like a Wesley.”
“I object to that remark very strongly,” Wesley’s voice informed them from the office.
~
“And Wesley let me help with a potion.”
“A curative,” Wesley added hastily. “No danger whatsoever.”
~
“Sweet little thing. Why’s she flickering in and out, though?”
“I’m not real,” Dawn said quietly.
“Oh! I didn’t know. I try not to talk to people that aren’t there, but it happens all the same. Least you’re honest about it.”
~
“How’d you get here, Spike?”
Spike shrugged, no easy task as he was pinned against the wall. “Stole a car.”
“About what I expected. And then you what, climbed in Dawn’s window?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” scoffed Spike. “I climbed in yours.”

No telling scary stories. No swearing. No smoking around her. No smoking in the lobby. No smoking around anything flammable. No drinking all the milk. No getting drunk. No playing of mind games. No making of lewd suggestions to Cordelia. No spooking of Fred.

“Ninety-nine percent of this job is research, Rebecca. It’s only when there’s no other choice that we go into physical battle.”

“Spike’s here? We’ve all been trying to convince ourselves it’s a bad dream.”

“Just wish I could do more,” she said. “On behalf of all magi who aren’t total bastards, I’d like to apologize for this guy’s existence.”
~
“I beg your pardon, I am not drunk. The technical term is ‘shit-faced,’ thank you very much.”
“Actually, I had a bet going with myself as to when you’d do this, seeing as you’ve been systematically breaking all my rules.”
“Swore in front of Dawn yesterday,” Spike said helpfully.
“I figured that would be one of the first to go. And you beat my schedule for getting roaring drunk by several hours. I honestly didn’t think you’d hit the sauce until tonight at the earliest.”
Spike thought that was funny. “I’m above average!”

“I hope we’re here in plenty of time,” he groused. “The Powers That Be might find themselves circumvented by lack of parking.”

“Listen to me, you stupid Terl, I’ll explain this very slowly: if you don’t let me in, I’m going to rip your horn right out of your forehead, then stuff it down your gullet until you’re wearing it as a tail. Do you understand?”

“I think I’m all right…On the other hand, I may collapse. I’ll let you know when I’ve decided.”

Xander winced at Matt took a hard fall. “That’s funny, it looks to me like he’s beating the crap out of Matt.”
“Green can take it,” Percy said dismissively. “Angel’s a pretty cool guy. Did you know he’s a vampire?”
“I heard that. Would you tell Mr. Cool Guy that the weapons have arrived, and he needs to come get some stakes?”
~
“If I could just get something for the pain? It’s rather a lot of pain, actually. If you would, perhaps I could just be knocked unconscious.”
~
“Spike!” he barked. “Violence.” Angel tossed the battle-axe at Spike, who caught it efficiently and with relish.
“Show me where.”
~
“It bit me while I was stabbing it in the throat.”
“That sort of thing tends to irritate dragons. Grab that thermos, would you?”
~
“You’ve changed a great deal,” the older man observed.
“My emotional maturity is slightly above that of a blueberry scone now, yes.”
~
We’re stuck doing things the slow way, with Giles scratching his head a lot and looking skeptical, and Xander standing around measuring things and saying encouraging things like, “Boy, what a mess!”  As if we can’t all see that for ourselves.
~
“Wait a moment.”  He peered at her face.  “Aren’t you dead?” 
“Occasionally.”
~
“And the ‘I will say nothing to you, Slayer!’ thing? Dead giveaway.  Your usual vamp would just say something intelligent like, ‘Huh?’”
~
Everything was fairly routine in Cardiff after a minor invasion by the Morda, a nasty-tempered race that would’ve been terribly hard to deal with if they’d been any larger than Rose’s hand.
~
“I’d like to briefly draw your attention to the fact that Rose’s friend called me ‘delectable.’ Isn’t that a wonderful word? Delectable!”
~
“That was my mum on the phone. Mickey’s Gran’s been hurt in a fall. She’s in hospital.”
The Doctor frowned. “No. That’s not important now. I need to find out where all these things have come from.”
She shook her head. “You don’t understand. Mickey’s Gran’s been dead for five years.”
~
“. . . and they’ve got me in this getup that Queen Elizabeth I would have called ‘a bit much’ with this headdress that I swear weighed six stone. I could barely stand up, and I’m thinking there’s no way I’m going to be able to make a run for it, and I’ll end up married to this alien despot with tentacles, and where the hell have the Doctor and Captain Jack got off to, anyway? And then, just as I’m getting prodded down the aisle toward my groom, Captain Jack comes running into the throne room, yelling . . .” She was laughing too hard to continue. 
Jack picked it up. “I’m yelling that there’s been a terrible misunderstanding, a translation went wrong somewhere, and Rose is actually the male of our species—but I’d be only too honoured to become the Emperor’s new wife! You’ve got to keep in mind that their females are cone-shaped with blue tentacles. He didn’t actually know much about humans, but he wanted to collect wives of as many species as he could since women among his kind are basically status symbols. Anyway, the Doctor and I decided I’d delay things while he figured out a way past palace security. It turned out to be a really good plan, actually; the Emperor was so horrified that he’d insulted a male human like that that he gave Rose his youngest wife.”
“Somewhere in the sixty-third century, I’m married to a girl with feathers for hair,” said Rose. “My mum would be so proud.”
~
He assumed that typical teenagers didn’t spend the first several weeks of school threat assessing their fellow students, learning the entire layout of the building and all its exits while figuring out which spots would be best to plant the C4 in case he ever needed to blow the thing up. However, upon observing the lurking and dark trenchcoats the others usually wore, he reconsidered that assessment.
~
“You two get ready; I’ll go cook something for breakfast.” Her son released an audible groan.
“I heard that!” she said, continuing on her way. “I can make tea–and toast– usually” she replied somewhat unconvincingly.
The Turner’s only child flung himself back on the bed. “We’re going to starve.”
~
She’s stopped reading, now; her (ridiculously gigantic) book is open in her lap, and she’s dangling a bit of string for Crookshanks. The great stupid beast is going crazy over it, of course, and Hermione keeps giggling and mumbling mental stuff like “oh, you almost got it, didn’t you!” and “you’re a brilliant little kitty, aren’t you? Yes you are!”
~
And now Hermione’s looking at him like he’s completely nuts. Excellent.
~
“I’m not writing an essay on Saturday morning, Hermione,” Ron informs her. “It goes against everything I stand for.”
“Being?” she asks skeptically.
“Not writing essays on Saturday morning, and beating the crap out of you at chess.”
~
‘I must not assault people while I’m in civvies, no matter how much they deserve it,’ Dick repeated over and over again.
~
Then she came down with poison ivy and so did the son of the bank president, in places where a clothed person wouldn’t get poison ivy.
~
“Apparently dead,” Alec argued.
“You were beginning to smell, Alec. You were dead.”
~
“Do you believe in the Lord, my dear?”
Kate gave him a bemused look. “Do you believe in rocks?”
~
“He irritates me. Let me break his bones.”
~
“High priority surgery? How high a priority?”
Bryant chuckled. “Let’s just say if it was between him and the president as to which one I was taking, the president would get Rodriguez.”
~
“Luthor’s body was stolen from the morgue sometime last night. Who the devil would want his body?” Henderson demanded.
Douglass shrugged. “Hopefully somebody who wants to bury him at a crossroads with a stake through his heart.”
~
“He took four slugs in the back while protecting someone else. He didn’t have to be out doing what he did and he knew the danger, maybe better than the cops did. It certainly wasn’t something I’d order a man to do. It wasn’t the action of a coward.”
“So you’re admitting you were wrong?” Watson found a smile forming on his face.
Lane glared at him. “I still don’t like his politics.”
~
“So, uh, why am I not supposed to be left alone?”
“So you won’t try to escape out the window?”
~
“As far as I know, the only people who know you well enough to want you dead all work here. And believe me they’re all clever enough to find ways to kill you that wouldn’t involve planting a bomb. Besides, that was Clark’s chair, so I’m pretty sure he was the target, not you.”
~
“That’s our girl. Knowing her, she’ll come back with an interview with the damned bomb telling us what makes it tick.”
~ Not that he was actually guilty, mind, but try explaining the finer points of law to a surly, and armed, rhinoceros.
~
The man made a strange gesture at the vidscreen. A gesture that, unbeknownst to the Earth-dwellers surrounding him, was considered quite rude in the Sbnar System, Northumberland from the years 4567 through 4569, and on a planet called Gallifrey.
~
“So you have, then, no idea who we are? Or what our aims are?”
“Not a sausage,” the Doctor replied cheerfully. 
~ “I’m the Doctor and this is Rose. We’re just passing through, don’t mind us.”
“Command, the male appears to be insane,” the voice said. “Request orders.”
~
His car was neatly parked in his parking space, as if to mock him. He circled it, prodded it, got in, got out. It remained stubbornly normal.
~
“I thought you said we had to stay undercover! That means not hitting Jack with a cricket bat!”
“I didn’t hit him with the bat,” he says defensively. “I threw it at the back of his legs.”
~
“Come to think of it, the toaster’s been acting up again and toast can always stand to be more stable.”
~
“I suppose it’s like you’ve been preapproved.”
“Yes!” Rose pointed at him. “Preapproved!”
“‘Course the parallel me, which I’m not completely buying yet, mind, could be barmy.”
~
“I’m not helping you, officially. And if anyone happens to ask whether I made any material difference to the welfare of this planet, you can tell them I came and went like a summer cloud.”
~
“Oh, marvellous. You’re going to kill me. What a finely tuned response to the situation.”
~
“Hello? Am I doing this right? Just realized I never actually left one of these voice-thingergadgets before. That’s sort of weird, now that I think of it, but I never had much need to. Well, I guess I don’t really need to now, either, but I dunno. Seems rude if I don’t. And it’s pretty straight forward, really – wait for beep, leave message. Which is what I’m doing right now. Leaving a message, that is. If I were waiting for the beep, you’d hardly know, right? Anyway, where was I? Oh, yes. Martha Jones! Doctor! That’s brilliant, that is. Best job in the whole universe, if I do say so myself. And you got one up on me with the diploma. Never did do well on my exams. But you! Blimey, that’s fantastic. Congratulations. And, um, yes. Okay. That’s all.”
~
“This is the Doctor, currently residing at Martha’s old phone number. If you’re trying to reach me, Martha, I can’t answer right now, possibly because the universe is ending or there are some really good drink specials at Milliways. And if you’re trying to reach Martha Jones, clearly she isn’t here anymore. What sort of friend are you that you don’t have her new number? For shame.”
~
“Sorry, me again. Just hadn’t heard back from you and I wasn’t sure if you were still mad or not.”[…] “Oh, stars, you are still mad, aren’t you?”[…] “Right. I’m going to stop calling now. This is me saying, I’m not going to call again.”
~
“No, he’s…tied up.”
“…you mean that literally, don’t you.”
“Little furry things with spears. They want to sacrifice him in my honour.”
“I’d say I’m surprised but I’m really, really not.”
“Right, well, it’d be nice to chat and everything, but—”
“—you’re a little busy. Got it. Tell him I called when he’s recovered his dignity, will you?”
~
“Hi, this is Dr. Owen Harper. You were on Martha Jones’ speed dial as her primary physician and I was hoping you could answer some questions pertaining to her medical records. There’s been an…incident and I need to know of any allergies, genetic disorders or pregnancies she might have had. If you can call me back on her cell or fax those records over to 029 2055 6731, it’d be much appreciated.”
“Doctor, it’s Jack. Ignore that previous message. Martha’s fine, I’m fine, we’re all fine here. How’re you?”
~
“Hey, Doc, Jack again. Listen, Martha’s fine, really.”
“Loooove you!”
“Just a little doped up at the moment.”
“An’ I love you, too, Jack.”
“And, uh, slightly more amorous than usual. Crisis averted, apocalypse cancelled, no need to get all Oncoming Storm on us.”
~ “Nah, hardly the worse thing to do on pain meds. I once held myself hostage after a difficult regeneration. Ask me about it sometime.”
~
“I just got to meet Harriet Jones! Jack knows her and there was some sort of official function he took me to and I met her! Harriet Jones! Though she’s got this thing where her left eye starts twitching whenever your name gets mentioned. What in the world did you do to her?”
“It’s not my fault! Well, mostly not my fault. Eighty percent. Eighty percent not my fault. Maybe seventy-five. And could hardly have expected who’d take over after –-And I’ve got an idea! Let’s never mention this ever again!”
~
“She’s right. You are rubbish with people. Take her somewhere nice. Tropical. Buy her some flowers – yellow flowers, and I mean that – and apologize for almost dying on her without a backup plan.”
~
“Thought this was Mum’s number.”
“Leo Jones, I am very much not your mother.”
~
“I don’t think it’s best to point out the fact that she has a point. The whole ‘upper-hand’ thing kind of gets thrown out the window.”
~
“How did he manage to reverse the polarity of the neutron flow on a cricket ball?”
~
“First we find the aliens. Second, we destroy the aliens. Third…we run around like mad men zapping everyone with the Reatomiser before they realised anything was wrong.”
~
Carrying a folder, she walks past his desk. He sighs. Carrying the same folder, she walks past his desk again. He drops his head in his hands. 
“I told Kelly that I needed some space,” Ryan explains. He nods a little, obviously frightened. “She did not take the news well… at all.”
~
“Oh, I’ve reached new lows,” he tells her, animated once again and sounding positively delighted with himself. 
~
He sniffs affectedly. “This is your fault,” he accuses her. “I was never this vain before you left that mirror with the glowy lights behind.”
~
The Doctor looked through his wallet, attempting to find some currency of the era; two shekels from Ancient Egypt, a lump of mineral that won’t be discovered on Earth for another 500 years, and finally, a scrunched up 5 pound note.
~
“We’d found this artefact, you know, but no one knew how to use it. Then I held it and it turned on, I’m not really sure how, but then I was here, and you all had guns. This is actually a bit heavy, now; think I could put it down, or am I still going to get shot if I move?”
~ “So after all that,” drawled Owen, “it turns out she is who she said, and I was right after all?”
“Savour it while it lasts,” Jack retorted, still unwilling to let go of the woman in his arms.
~
“I’m a manifestation of the part of your mind that isn’t hiding in a corner cowering in terror,” Richard explained.
~ “But I guess if it’s mine I might as well put it to some use. Maybe I’ll buy a Quidditch team.”
“You already own one,” stated Giles.
~
“Oz doesn’t count!” Harry cried. “Did he try to eat you?”
“No...um I don’t think so...did you?” He turned to Oz who shrugged.
~
“Doesn’t count! You’re the fricking Light of Hell, you can’t get credit for stopping yourself!”
~
“Oh, don’t get me wrong, this isn’t concern. It’s just that when you broke your arm last year playing this infernal sport, it cost us a small fortune to get it set.”
“This coming from the guy who tripped down the stairs and broke multiple ribs not even three months ago.”
~ Everyone had agreed that the idea of Tim on ice skates while wielding a hockey stick was enough to strike terror into the hearts of teenagers everywhere. As such, he had been forbidden to play. Tim of course, saw it as a form of tyrannical oppression and had on several occasions, threatened to overthrow them. In-between these bursts of rebellion, however, he tended to sulk.
~
“My parents really hated me. My bath toys were a radio and a toaster oven.”
~
“Are you kidding me?” she said. Before he could say if he was or wasn’t, she repeated the same question to the sky. “Are you freakin’ kidding me?” Cole traded a bewildered look with Lonnie and wondered if perhaps the woman was seriously disturbed.
“Maybe – maybe we should go,” Lonnie said, hand tightening on his arm.
The redhead ignored them and continued to ask questions of the sky. “What did I ever do to you?”
“I think that’s an excellent idea,” Cole replied.
~
“You’re quite certain she’s a demon?”
“No doubt at all,” Paige said.
“That’s a relief. I feel far less guilty for disliking her so thoroughly, then.”
~
“Daniel told us what happened….Because we made him, that’s why.”
~
Rule 58: Quit travelling through time. It creates too much paper work.
~ Rubber duckies are not religious icons. Stop telling new cultures that they are. Nor are you to tell said new cultures that our national anthem is the Rubber Ducky song from Sesame Street. (SG-18 was gleefully corrupting the universe, one planet at a time.)
~ The natives of P45-172 had a sacred parrot. Floppy ate it.
~
“You have that Look. You know, the one that says ‘There’s no point to life anymore, I’m going to conveniently find a big group of Death Eaters and go down fighting.’”
“I actually hadn’t gone that in-depth,” Sirius said, but didn’t deny it.
~
Floppy did not take kindly to these things, and proceeded to let everyone know though the universal language of biting.
~
“Ooh, that can’t be right. Are you sure it doesn’t have wings?”
“Not unless they’re invisible wings.”
~
“Oy!” Rose called out. “I hear thumping!”
“No. Sorry. That’s me,” the Doctor said. “And my head. And the wall.”
~ “Well, I had a girlfriend, y’know.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “You had a barnacle.”
~
“Well, as long as you don’t turn anyone into a tree I can’t complain.”
“This coming from the girl that single-handedly destroyed a palace? Besides, would you rather I had let Tristan annihilate you?”
“I suppose I can make an exception if I’m in mortal danger. And it wasn’t single-handedly; it was the dinosaurs did most of it.”
“Dinosaurs that you revived,” he pointed out, getting the last word. 
~ Zoë was the first one to speak. “Jayne,” she said. “Is there any particular reason you’ve suddenly acquired wings and a bow and arrow?”
~
“You knew he was a zombie, and you sent me in there anyway!” Chase accused his boss.
“Did you fix him?” came Gregory House’s snide reply.
“He tried to eat my brains!”
“And he messed up your hair,” House helpfully pointed out.
~
Without thought he began to catalogue his symptoms, estimating the time it would take him to bleed out. It didn’t always pay to be a doctor, he thought fuzzily as the room faded away.
~
“I feel like someone beat the snot out of me.” Chase paused. “And kind of floaty.”
~
“I went to see a patient in a prison and there was a riot. I’m fine. Just managed to get my nose broken.”
“And,” she studied him closely, “you’re holding your stomach because your nose hurts?”
“I might have been shot as well.”
~
More giggling, rustling, and hushing sounds. A moment later, Simon replied in a rather breathless tone of intense nothing-going-on-here, “Yes, Inara? Did you—did you need something?”
~
“But no green tea for you, xiâo mèi. You’ll be up all night conjugating verbs again.”
~
“Mr. Black,” he began, in the same tone of voice that had caused his whole Gryffindor-Slytherin fifth year class to meekly sit down and write an essay on salamanders, instead of hexing each other under the desks, “are you seriously trying to tell me that your parents– your father, Mesarthim, and your mother, Céibhfhionn– would name their children Vindemiatrix, Pulcherrima, Denebola…and Bernard?”
~
She threw it back. It made a satisfyingly biscuity noise as it bounced off his forehead.
~
“How is it that can I hear Angela calling me a hussy from all the way over there and her lips aren’t even moving?” Pam mused.
“It’s a skill she’s spent years and years honing to perfection.” 
~
“I’m sorry, I just don’t think it’s possible Clark’s alive. I was there. The explosion…nothing could have survived that.” 
Martha’s expression was enigmatic as she gave Lois’s hand another squeeze. It was almost like she was trying to impart some sort of message, though Lois had no idea what that could be. “Oh, sweetheart…you did.”
~
‘He wasn’t interested in my medical opinion when he cornered me outside the bathroom and propositioned me.’
‘And what did you say?’
‘That I only had time for a quickie, what do you think?’
‘I think I have a sudden, inexplicable urge to come over there and make a scene.’
~ “He was the one who dragged me here - I’m the designated driver. You’re welcome to him.”
“Uh-huh, and is he drunk? I don’t want him if he’s drunk.”
“He should be fine, if he stops now. Cuddy says stop drinking.”
“She’s not the boss of me!” House contributed loudly, leaning over to shout right into the phone. 
~
“Speaking of ladies - maybe it’s my beer goggles talking but has anyone ever told you, you bear a striking resemblance to Heidi Klum?”
Fairly certain that Heidi Klum was a six foot tall, blonde supermodel, she said, “Those are some beer goggles.”
~
“Steven?” She shrugged. “Actually that’s—” She stopped talking abruptly. “House. We are not naming the baby after your pet rat.”
“Joe it is, then.”
“Or your goldfish.”
He heaved a very heavy, very fake sigh. “There’s a word for people like you - specist.”
“That’s not a word. Tell you what, how about I name the baby, then if we ever get a goldfish, you can name that.”
“You’ll just pick something girlie, like Francis, or James.”
“I suppose you have a more manly name in mind?”
“Brutus? I’m still pulling for Joe. Joe is sensible. Short for Joseph, a decent Jewish name if I ever heard one. Your mother will love it.”
~
“Just wait till you hear the perfectly good explanation for Cuddy answering my phone just now. It involves me being in her bed and - well, that’s it, actually.”
~
“Your place is closer.”
“No it’s not.”
“As the crow flies.” She stared at him till he added, “In opposites land.”
~
“First thing first - I really wouldn’t advise anyone to say anything to anybody about me and Cuddy. And by ‘wouldn’t advise’ I mean ‘will happily kill’. Everybody got that? Excellent. Let’s move on.”
~
If Harry had been thinking clearer, he might have come up with something more profound to say with his last words on this world.
“You can keep my sandwich.”
~
Two of the Unspeakables cast immediate bubblehead charms, while the third had impressively managed to conjure an entire set of scuba gear complete with a working oxygen tank.
~
Harry raised a curious eyebrow. “You have a standard operating procedure for dimension travellers?”
~
“You don’t have to be anywhere, do you?” Harry sighed, falling into step with his godfather. 
“Yes, I’ve followed you into a brand new dimension, managed to locate you, and now have to cut it short for a meeting before lunch.”
~
“I do want to catch up, Sirius, but are you sure drinking this early is the best idea?”
Sirius led Harry across the street. “I don’t know. Are the last ten years of your life anything like the first five at Hogwarts were?”
Harry paused and agreed. “You’re right. We need alcohol.”
~
“Us?” Sirius grinned. “I’m automatically included in your inevitable quest for vengeance?”
~
“On a completely unrelated side note, if you ever happen to try apparating while wearing magic inhibiting cuffs, you should know that you’ll splinch your hands off at the wrist.”
~
“Fixed in my convictions, I confidently answered ‘No!’” Ginny sighed and admitted softer, “But the effect was lessened by Owen Cauldwell raising his hand and admitting, ‘I kind of fear you’ at the same time as my declaration.”
~
Remus stopped as he entered his living room and spotted the ghost of Ginny Weasley, a young man he couldn’t quite place, and Sirius grinning at him, clearly a little inebriated. Remus closed his eyes and counted to ten. When he opened them all three people were still there, smiling and waving at him. “Please tell me you didn’t kill Miss Weasley,” Remus begged of his houseguest.
~
“Well, let’s get this over with so I can get back to work. I figure this will either work or you shall die. Come along.”
~
“Curious. That is the exact same wand Sirius Black used to have. What did you say your name was again?”
“Sirius Black,” he answered happily.
“Just a coincidence, I’m sure,” Harry added with a firm nod.
~
“How’re you doing with that? Because Sirius still likes to break down snivelling like a little baby.”
“One time!” Sirius insisted. “One time a bug flies in my eye.”
“A bug no one could ever locate,” Tonks added.
“It must have flown away,” Harry mockingly suggested.
“Thank you,” Sirius agreed. “That’s exactly what it did.”
“Although come to think of it. I think it flew back in your eye when I found you yesterday. Pesky reappearing bug.”
“Bugger off,” Sirius grumbled with a smile.
~
“I’m not stuffy,” Harry grumbled. “He’s a judgmental pillock.”
~
“I see three different sets of wards. Any ideas on how you want to get around them?”
“Killing Curse?”
“Let’s try this again. Any ideas on how we can get past the wards without setting them off?”
~
“I don’t know, that’s the thing,” Harry said with a shrug. “We could be able to safely walk past them without ever triggering, or we could walk through them and they choose to kill us in a very messy manner.”
~
“Voldemort put a fair amount of effort into protecting his little toys with lots of devious and dangerous traps.”
“You hunted for his toys?”
“By toys, I was referring to the pieces of his soul that he’d split off, and whose continued existence meant for all intents and purposes he was immortal.”
~
“I’m asking it to close. I’m ordering it to close. I’m willing it to close. It’s not closing!”
Sirius frowned. “Maybe you need to bleed on it again.”
~
“This all looks great,” Harry leaned down to talk quieter. “I just wanted to make sure none of this is the poisoned food.”
Kreacher felt hope for the future blossom in his cold black heart. “Not this time, Master. But I can poison some desserts if you like.”
~
“Slap him with a fish?” Tonks asked with a grin.
With a pop a shirtless Sirius apparated right next to Harry. “What the hell? Did you tell that demented elf to do that?”
Harry shrugged. “I might have offered a suggestion on one way to grab your attention.”
“Stab me in the ass with a swordfish?”
Harry looked at others and frowned. “Hmm. We may need to be exceedingly precise in our instructions to Kreacher.”
~
“He fell into his open safe,” Tonks chuckled. “That’s one of the poorest examples of covering your tracks I’ve ever heard of.”
~
“Who the hell are you?” the old man in the mirror asked suspiciously.
Harry sighed. “We’re supposed to be under glamours, remember?”
“Yeah, but still. How do I know you really are… who… you… don’t look anything like?”
~
“We’ll try and hone in on the signals tonight and assess the location.”
“‘Case the joint,’ Harry, just say ‘case the joint.’”
~
“That’s a TV? I had no idea they grew that big.”
~
“My associate never finished his schooling and you know how dropouts are. He overcompensates and corrects people for no real reason.”
~
“We’re to settle disputes with duels? I don’t think it has changed in a thousand years. There’s even a wielder of the Sovereign Sabre!”
“There’s a sword?” Sirius asked curiously.
“Yeah. Whoever’s got the sabre has the right to interrupt any proceedings at any time for any reason. And they must be heard.”
“That does seem a bit… medieval,” Sirius said. “Can you stab people with it?”
Harry shrugged. “What good does wielding the Sovereign Sabre do if you can’t stab the guy next to you when it tickles your fancy?”
~
“Take a shower. We should drop in and visit the Chamber of Lords lounge before the Wizengamot convenes.”
“There’s a lounge?” Sirius asked.
Harry nodded. “And hookers there to service you.”
“Well alright,” Sirius agreed, finally seeing the benefit of establishing a political presence […]
“Harry,” Sirius commented as the two walked in. “I see a bunch of old men. Perhaps we need to clarify the definition of hooker.” 
“I don’t think that’s necessary. You might have misinterpreted my meaning when I said there would be hookers here to service you.”
“You mean when I took your line ‘there will be hookers here to service me’ to mean that there would be hookers here to service me?”
“Yup,” Harry agreed. “That doesn’t sound anything like my meaning.”
“How do you do?” A man greeted walking up to them. “Lord Thomas Hooker. My friends call me TJ.”
~
“I believe it is the Donnelly hereditary seat, as Lord Charles Donnelly wielded the sabre at sessions as recently as 1782. Sir Tapper, you’re the representative for the Donnelly family, are you not? Did you perchance bring the Sovereign Sabre with you?”
“Begging your pardon Chief Warlock, but until a minute ago I didn’t know any Sovereign Sabre existed.”
~
“I’m still not sure if I buy that. But I suppose if I don’t then you’re just a figment of my imagination. And I suppose I may have sacrificed another of the neighbour’s cats unnecessarily.”
~
“I also know you’re aware that Mr. Ollivander was obliviated and is missing a wand.”
“Before you go pointing that finger,” Sirius interjected. “May I remind you that we are the reason he’s even aware he was obliviated and lost a wand. We were as surprised as he was.”
~
“No not illegal,” Rockwell assured him but with a devious smirk, “They’ve no need to make it illegal when no one knows about it.”
~
“Does Lois still wear that red polka dot bikini?” Pete innocently asked just as Clark shot.
A slip of concentration sent the cue ball flying into the opposite wall. Clark sighed. “Where’s the spackle?”
Pete chuckled and said. “You can get it next time. I’ll just hang a poster up for now.”
~
“Luna we’ve been over this,” Mr. Lovegood shook his head. “If you can’t remember to feed the dog then how do you expect me to believe you’re responsible enough for weapons grade plutonium?”
~
“Don’t you have some devious plans to regale me with? I’m sitting here taking all your curses and not fighting back in the slightest. The least you could do is to give me some insight about what diabolical schemes you have in store for me and the wizarding world.”
~
“Let’s try again. Do you want to live?...Lovely,” the clone smiled. “Because it’s late, and I really should get back to bed. Got to get up early and get started on my homework. I am a student you know. And I really don’t want to deal with this hassle. So you need to gather up all your moronic friends here, and clean up this mess you’ve made.”
~
“If you lie, he will kill you. If you hesitate, he will kill you. If you try to run, he will kill you. But if you act like a weak-willed subservient piece of trash and as though you are lucky to be given the privilege of licking the toe jam from his filthy lizard like feet, then you will probably live. And if I were you, I’d also tell my other moronic friends what happened here and why it might not be such a hot idea to go down with that useless waste of a wizard. Voldemort is not immortal. Voldemort is not a god. He will not give you any power. He’s going to die. And I’m going to be the one to make sure his last moments are extremely painful and drawn out. But right now, I still have some homework that’s a lot more important than madmen with delusions of grandeur. Good night.”

“Insufferable twerp. And the worst of all was he gave us a lot of money. He claimed it was for room and board. Cheeky brat won’t take it back. When we tried to get the Goblins to take it back, they had been instructed to give us more.”
~
“You knocked me unconscious and brought me here!” he snapped angrily. “And somehow I’m supposed to explain this situation?”
~
“I can’t touch that. Or didn’t you notice me walking through the sodding wall to get here?”
~
Snape shifted abruptly to guard it, and the lizard part of Dudley’s brain informed him that anything that moved that fast was a predator.
~
Snape suddenly turned into a very large canary. Dudley jumped nearly four inches, which was further than he’d jumped in two years as far as Harry knew. “Was that supposed to happen?”
~
Vernon Dursley was grateful to be put back into his own shape, but he’d have been more grateful still if he hadn’t ended up crouched hands and knees on the dining room table. It creaked unnervingly and he scrambled off of it quickly, only coming up short when he found himself nose to wandtip with a huge black stranger, whose smile was quite as unnerving as Professor’s Snape’s scowl.
~
“The price isn’t going to go down just because you keep repeating it in disbelief.” 
~
“How about someplace that hasn’t been closed by the health inspector?” 
“They’ve reopened. If we hurry, we’ll get there before they’re shut down again.”
~
“So it can’t die? Then how the hell are we meant to kill it?”
“Ah…slightly more complicated question.”
“Great. Glad I’ve got you then.”
~
‘Christmas’ has an H in it, Mr Baldrick...and an R.  Also an I, and an S.  Also T and M and A...and another S.  Oh, and you’ve missed out the C at the beginning.  Congratulations, Mr Baldrick!  Something of a triumph, I think -- you must be the first person ever to spell ‘Christmas’ without getting any of the letters right at all.
~
“...and the Sheepsqueezers of Splatican Five?  Have they been suckcreamed as a Qvarnbeast’s nobbo?”
“Well, they’re dead, if that’s what you mean.”
“Plus, Commander, did you vanquish the Nibblepibblies?”
“No, My Lord Pigmot, I did not vanquish the Nibblepibblies, because you just made them up.”
~
“He’d never gotten phone calls before. It was actually what tipped us off in the first place that he wasn’t quite normal.”
“What, other than the inability to die?”
~ “You’re doing well – but I expected that. Anyone strong enough to threaten Gwen with a wheelchair is going to be fine.”
~
“You know as well as I do that one doesn’t date Luna. One arranges to be in the same place at the same time as Luna. It’s nice if she actually recognizes you in the process, but it’s optional.”
~ “You’re saying a cross between Hitler and Saruman has been doing the wizard equivalent of ethnic cleansing... and nobody’s heard about it?”
~ “Gee, Mr. Potter, can I have something you’ve personally touched? Would you please call me by my first name? Please?” Ginny mocked.
“Sod off,” grumbled Harry.
~
“He would’ve used a password that only one of us would know…Without telling any of us the password, of course.”
~
Three incantations rang out: “Expelliarmus!” “Stupefy!” “Reducto!” Margaret, who couldn’t have used magic even if she’d wanted to, chose the direct approach. Leaning to one side for balance, she raised her leg and delivered a piledriver kick straight into Malfoy’s kidney.
All of which happened as Malfoy concluded, “—KedavrAAARGH!”
~
He wasn’t going to miss the birth of his godson (for Ron had no doubt the first Potter baby would be a boy) just because the American Secretary of Defence might choose today to publicly align himself with the Dark side.
~ “Look,” he’d tell the waitress each time she passed their table, pointing to the picture of his newborn son he had taken before leaving Ginny and baby James for an hour or two. “That’s my son. Isn’t he the most brilliant baby you’ve ever seen?”
~
Sirius noticed that his feet were carrying him in the direction of the stairs to the kitchens. ‘O, clever feet,’ he thought happily. ‘Splendid feet.’
~
“Do you want a spoon?” When Sirius frowned, Remus cleared his throat and said, “Eating utensil, commonly found in kitchens—” 
“I remember what spoons are, thanks. Had to use one at Arabella’s. Don’t think I’m capable just now.”
~
“Apparently there was some sort of mishap in the fourth-year transfiguration class. This little guy used to be a fork.”
~
“You’re from the future, and another you from the future told you to come and get us to go save you in the present? I hate time travel.”
~
‘Nutters,’ James thought wretchedly, ‘I’m going to spend my glorious fifth year baby-sitting nutters.’
~ Startled, she turned and glared at him icily. “Ron, we go to Mr. Bauman’s Private School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In London. Where we have been attending for five years.” Noticing James incredulous stare, the girl laughed nervously. “It was a long trip.” 
~ “The city’s been talking to you?” It was going to be a long day, he just knew it.
~
“Only had to use it once in combat Sir,” Finn said. “That was a slightly weirder day than normal.”
“You used a mace in combat?” the sarcasm dripped from O’Neill’s words.
“Nearest weapon at hand,” Finn answered with complete seriousness. “My sword got stuck in … in another bad guy’s chest.”
“You were using a sword?” 
“Like I said Sir, it was a weird day,” Finn said. “My gun was useless, there was a sword on the wall, I used it. When I lost that I grabbed a mace. Managed to hold the bad guys off long enough for my 2IC to get there with the flame thrower.”
~ “You want to tell me how you infiltrated a top secret military base with a card pinned to your shirt that says ‘I am supposed to be here?’”
~
“Mr Giles, I know that this is a special urn, you know that this is a special urn. I need this special urn and I’m willing to make sure that you are paid very well for the urn. So why can’t I have the urn?” Jack demanded
“Before I sell this urn to anyone I intend to make sure that it will be used properly.”
“You can use an urn improperly? Look, it’s a matter of life and death.” Jack stated emphatically and Giles’ head snapped up. 
“Life and death?” Giles sighed, “Will that be cash or charge?”
~
“Ready, girls? We’ll do Frolicking and Cavorting Routine Number 10.”
“I don’t remember that one,” a nymph complained.
~
“Do you realize that our whole timeline could have blinked out of existence if you’d eaten that pudding?!”
~
“What do you mean we’re nowhere? How can we be nowhere? That’s impossible isn’t it?”
Rose looked at the Doctor and smiled. “Do you want the long or short answer?”
He considered the matter. “Short.”
She gazed up at the clouds. “Then the answer is no, it’s not impossible.”
“Long, then. I want the long answer.”
~ “Everybody lived,” she said with a smile, her eyes sparkling. 
“Except me, apparently.”
~
“If she’s guilty, I’ll nail her for it, no matter how long we’ve been friends. But I know her well enough to know she wouldn’t do this.” Not and leave evidence for me to find, she added silently.
~
“What’s your name?” Nightwing asked.
“They call me Scorpius,” The pimp replied.
“What’s your real name?”
“Laurence Washington,” he said with a sigh.
~ “Was that it, Malfoy? Because that wasn’t particularly earth-shattering, there, as cryptic messages to deadly foes tend to go.”
~
You see, it isn’t the words that matter, it’s the sinister message laced within them. And in this case, “Quirrell – might I have a word?” can be roughly translated to I hope you told your iguana you loved him before you left, because guess what? You might not live another day to impugn his reptilian masculinity. “Oh, it will only take a moment.” That’s right; there’s a good chance you’ll die here, cowardly turban-wearing scum. “I must confess myself curious about your recent activities.” I see through you like a piece of glass, and I can kill you where you stand with nothing more than the tone of my voice. “The Restricted Section, Quirrell?” Nothing more. Than the tone. Of my voice.
~
“What on earth was that about?” Snape demanded, staring after her with a scowl.
“Oh, she wants me to seduce you for your birthday,” I replied, without really thinking about it.
“Charming,” Snape said, wrinkling his nose. I am relatively sure that if I’d said ‘I’m going to chop you into bite-sized pieces and then feed you to the giant squid,’ his reaction would have been the same. Perhaps a tad less disgusted.
“She’s insane,” I said dismissively, then added, “I’m not going to, by the way.”
“Thank God for small mercies,” he murmured. 
~
“You sure you don’t want to come, kid?”
“I know, how can I stand to pass up this brilliant opportunity to watch a bunch of people dressed up like penguins get drunk?”
~
“I can’t believe it, they summoned a bloody demon and they were boasting about it! Bloody Illyria, for Merlin’s sake.” 
“They must be out of their minds!” 
“If I felt that the opinions of muck mattered,” said a quiet voice, “I would be offended.” 
~
“Yes, you know, Captain of a supernatural crew and all – summon them!” Linus waved his hands dramatically in the air.
“Whatever the hell you gentlemen did to me has – limited – my connection to the Dutchman. I’ve been ‘summoning’ ever since you finished that rite. And judging by their prompt appearance to save the day …”
~ “Well it makes for a small change at least – we haven’t been in mortal peril together for years. Its kind of …”
“What? Have you been in mortal peril without me? Will, I’m shocked! Hurt even!”
~
“No, I don’t remember. Are you sure I knew what I was signing?”
“You signed it,” Sammy said like that made it an acceptable answer.
~
“I told you I’d kill you slow next time I saw you, Reynolds,” the redhead says. 
“Bertani,” Mal says with a friendly, unnerving smile. “Remember the creepy guy with the accent back on Jiangying? It was twenty gorram years ago, but try. So you remember how he threatened to sell ya out? You think it’s possible that—and I’m just guessin’ here—he sold you out? As in, him and not me?”
~
“Your father is proud of you, Ben,” Inara says. 
“That why he called me a moron and offered to shoot me himself? Does it get tiresome constantly translating from Dad to Sane People?”
~ “It’s true, though,” Dad says, unsmiling. “The uniform’s a chick magnet.”
Surprised into laughter, Ben has another pull at the brandy bottle. “That how you caught a Companion?”
“No, that’s how I caught me an Amazon. Stuck to me like grease on Kaylee for ten gorramn years.”
“Aunt Zoë’s a chick?”
“Best not tell her I said so.”
~
“I’ll just need a moment,” said the tall stranger. He walked over to the wards, waved and whistled loudly to attract attention, then made a throat-cutting gesture with his hand. There was a short pause; then with a soft ‘twang’ the defensive wards vanished. The carpet started unrolling again, stretching out until it reached the main doors. 
~
After a moment’s reflection, he added, “Let’s never leave.”
Allison laughed at that. “Don’t you think someone might miss us eventually?”
“Nah,” he responded, feeling too content to be bothered with logic.
~
“I didn’t blow up a galaxy. Just half a solar system. And it’s not like it was inhabited.” 
“Oh, well, that makes it okay.” Carter was looking at McKay as if he expected him to push a button on his laptop and destroy Earth.
~ “I’ve been working on this ever since Walter laid the groundwork with his formula for inner molecular sight reduction.”
“You mean, when he almost undid time and creation as we know it.”
~ “I’ll knock him upside the head, that’s what I’ll do,” Jackie promised in a huff. With a frying pan, no doubt. The Doctor always got the wooden spoon, but he had a feeling from her frustration level that Jackie’d be upgrading to heavier kitchen devices shortly.
~
He looked at him like he was crazy. Which was funny coming from a grown man in the process of running away from home. Again.
~
“He would have done it better. He did do it better. That one time. Or he will.” She really enjoyed making sense, didn’t she? But her eyes came back into focus.
~ Then, without visible warning, she pulled back and slapped him across the face. “That is for drugging me, Jack Harkness,” she grumbled harshly, but softened. “Ok, I forgive you. I needed the nap. My brain wasn’t quite right yet.”
Martha Jones slowly started backing away from Rose and Jack. “Oh yeah, cos you’re so right in the head now.”
“Fine! But I’m going this way, and if anybody wants to meet Shakespeare, then you’d better get inside, because the train is leaving!”
“Is she always this nuts?” Martha asked as the door clicked closed behind them.
He just watched Rose run around the console with a frenetic energy he’d only seen in one other person. “Only since she became an alien.”
“That sort of thing contagious?”
Walking down the ramp, Jack wasn’t sure what to say. “Probably not.”
~ “Because it’s never ‘just a drink’ with you,” replied Jack. “It’s never ‘just’ anything. There’s always an ‘and’ on the end of it. Lunch and saving the universe. A haircut and running for our lives. Drinks and—”
~
“Captain,” said the Doctor in a slightly condescending tone, “I am a highly-evolved life form; I think I can handle a bit of alcohol.”
As it turned out, he couldn’t. “You are my best friend!” He slurred, catching Jack in an awkward sort of side-hug. “Did you know that?”
~
“That’s a lie, and you know it,” scoffed Jack. “There’s no way I’d be better off not knowing you, for one.”
“Talk to me when you’re a head in a jar.”
“Something tells me I don’t want to know what that means.” The Doctor gave him a devilish grin that confirmed Jack’s statement.
~
Oliver looked distinctly relieved when Harry and a red-faced Ron each took one of Hermione’s elbows and steered her away from the traumatized Quidditch Captain. “I think you’ve made your point,” Harry said in a coaxing tone. “Oliver has seen the light. Haven’t you, Oliver? No more four-hour practices on weeknights, right?” Oliver quickly nodded, edging toward the stairs to the boys’ dormitories.
~
“It’s bloody ridiculous,” Hermione said, earning herself a nudge from Ron. “What if you get struck by lightning?”
“Hope the broom doesn’t explode between your legs?” Ron answered with a grin.
~
“He needs protection.”
Shawn gave her an incredulous look. “Does he realise he’s in a police station?”
~
“Well...” Pam began thoughtfully. “The demolition derby is at the Lackawanna County Fairgrounds this weekend.”
“I’m not sure if it scares me more that you might actually be offering that as a possibility, or that you even know that information at all.”
~
“The only possible way you could have gotten there before me is if you flew.” She expected to hear Clark’s jovial, Oh, Lois, that’s ridiculous. But he paused. His face was expressionless, almost scared. Then his blue eyes held hers.
For a second she saw a lightness – an expression of hope–dart through them. Then he replied, “That’s impossible.” Yet his answer was off; he said it with too much seriousness.
~
“So, believe me, the only things you really need to worry about in first year are exams, and teachers who secretly have two faces, and really, what are the odds of that happening twice?”
~ Oliver frowned at Winnie. “You said I know who.”
“No, I said You-Know-Who.”
“Right. Who do I know?”
“It’s not... like that. It’s just You-Know-Who.”
“Who?!”
“Voldemort,” Teddy said, both amused and annoyed. Immediately, the entirety of the half-full common room suspended their conversation to turn and stare at Teddy. Some looked around, terrified. “Not here,” he clarified to the room quietly, blushing again. “They’re... they’re talking... I was just... nevermind.” He shrank in his chair and looked distressedly at Winnie, who ogled at him.
~ “I was listening the whole time,” Teddy lied sheepishly.
“I asked you if you kept penguins at your house, and you said, ‘yeah, sometimes’.”
~ “I’m Oliver,” Oliver said, stepping forward and holding out a hand to Harry. “I—er—didn’t know who you were until three weeks ago, and I can honestly say I haven’t ever considered the benefits of marrying you.”
~ “Also it would be a bit of a giveaway that we were involved if we exploded the Grease Monster as well.”
“As well as what?” Sirius looked suddenly astounded that he hadn’t filled James in yet.
“Sorry, Prongs, I forget sometimes that you’re not actually inside my head. 
~
Exam time was getting to everybody. Remus had taken to hexing Peter to be quiet whenever he started talking too much. Peter, in turn, had taken to making sure Remus was nowhere in sight when he spoke.
~
“The solemn land of Those Who Have Been Denied Once and For All is calling you. Penny’s there already, at least you’ll have a friend.”
“That wasn’t a denial,” James scoffed, striding ahead of Sirius and Peter, who rushed to catch up.
“Have you gone completely round the bend? She said you weren’t worth the bother of arguing with. Before, I even agreed that she probably had the hots for you just judging on how fired up she got when she argued with you, but …what could you have possibly—”
“She called me James,” he stated simply, shrugging and grinning. Sirius gaped incredulously, bringing a hand up swiftly to his forehead as though to smack it but redirecting it at the last minute and clonking James upside the head. James barely flinched. 
“He’s a goner,” Sirius confided to Peter, who nodded grimly.
~
“I hate being under the Fidelius Charm. There’s all this being careful and not getting into trouble. Why’d you two have to go and get yourselves put on Voldemort’s hit list anyway?”
~
“Happiest I’ve ever seen him. In some places, you could see where ink blots had been on the parchment in his last letter because--get this--he was excited while he was writing.”
“We are talking about the same Kingsley Shacklebolt, right? Tall, deep voice, dry sense of humour, completely deadpan all the effing time?”
~ “I can’t think of two people better for the job than you and Alice.” Remus frowned. “Who is being oddly silent. Are you all right, Alice?”
Alice nodded happily, but didn’t make a sound. Frank grinned and kissed her forehead lightly. “She’s terribly fond of Droobles’ gum; she fell asleep while chewing some last night and... er... hasn’t as yet gotten her teeth unstuck.”
~ “And if any more of those vultures show up looking for the Kents, send them out by way of Potter’s Slough, would you?”
Greg snorted. “Actually, I was thinking of Whittaker’s Bog. That should keep them busy for a few hours. Especially if they take the long way around the lake and past the power station.”
“Sounds even better,” Rachel said, recalling the maze of rutted, dirt and gravel roads that the unfortunate members of the media would have to traverse. “Do that. Might let Dan, at the service station, know if you do, so the truck can be out of service when they call.”
~
“If your friend shows up again, I’ll deal with him. But I thought I taught you better than that, son.” He shook his head more in sorrow than in anger. “Why in heaven’s name didn’t you send him out to Porcupine Gulch?”
~ “For starters,” he chuckled, “I wasn’t stupid enough to try and witness my own birth! When Draco Malfoy was born, I was halfway across Britain checking out a hexed wristwatch, not sitting on the front stoop.”
~
“But when a person’s magic is twisted or warped or added to, it affects the animagus form. Who knows what my animagus form might have been originally, now it’s some freakish thing with a lion’s head, a cobra for a tail, dragon feet and big feathery wings.”
“So, let me get this straight… you don’t want to turn into something that can fly and has two mouths, one of which is poisonous?”
~ With a sigh, he again explained the laws governing guild rights to exclusive trial of members. He almost wished that all members of law enforcement were required to take classes in magical law. Almost. Because, had they taken such a class, it would be more likely that one of them would point out that he needed the signatures of at lest ten Masters of the guild to actually remove a guilder from ministry control.
~ “Dogons can’t teleport, it’s one of their most basic limitations. And how the hell would it “turn off” its pheromones?”
~
“Perhaps you would like to be robed?” What difference did it make if he were naked or not . . . he was dead.
Dumbledore cut into his thoughts, “I think you’ll be more comfortable dressed, should you encounter anyone else.”
Snape glanced around the dark, unmoving forest. “Whom would I encounter, here, of all places?”
Dumbledore clasped his hands behind his back and paced slowly. “Anyone also dead is a possibility.”
~
“There is very little ability to touch here. Sirius has an advantage there as well. I sometimes send him on missions to hug as a result.”
“Do. Not. Send. Him. To. Me.” Snape stated, appalled to the core.
~
She turned to him and exclaimed, “Sev!” as though greeting someone she, well, cared deeply about. He froze and as a result did not move fast enough to avoid a hug. 
“Just because I am dead, does not mean I have lost my mind,” he said to her, but she just smiled in return.
~
“Look, I know it might be hard to believe, but she’s been abducted by aliens.”
“Obviously,” Mickey replied abruptly, surprising the jaded Captain. “But which aliens?”
~ “It’s a bloke thing, Hermione.” Harry slung a companionable arm around her shoulder. “Just accept it.”
~
“We avoid each other as much as possible. If you didn’t insist that he spend his nights in my quarters, doing his best to give me heart failure, it would be an excellent relationship.”
~
‘Business meeting’ could mean anything from discussing the next year’s financial moves to a torture-and-murder session with a family of muggles, but he couldn’t precisely come out and ask.
~
He pointed at the tattooed stars on his left shoulder in turn. “This one, they blackmailed me into taking a year and half ago. This one, I think somebody stuck on me when I wasn’t looking.”
~
He ate like a child, always had, and burned the calories off in some mysterious male way that turned them into hardened muscle.
~
“I was transferred six months ago. I have my own office. With my name on the door.” He said it in the tone most people would confess to a shark-infested moat. Of course, Jack would probably like one of those.
~
“According to Lois, it looks good if we match; apparently it shows unity to people.”
“That or they’ll think you two share a brain now.” 
~
“I don’t need anyone gettin’ into trouble today,” he said, eyeing the Doctor with an expression that said he very clearly considered the other man to be a trouble magnet. The Doctor felt this was a bit unfair, since he hadn’t even gotten into trouble yet.
~
“Oh, I blend in very well,” the Doctor assured him, despite all evidence to the contrary.
~
“Yes, and as powerful as I am, even I can’t tell tectonic plates not to shift on my wedding day.”
~
“And if he isn’t dead…well, someone went to some trouble to make it appear he is. Being dead is a wonderful cover.”
~ He sneered right back at the man. “I forget sometimes, not all of us are capable of logical thought.”
~ “I’ve been thinking, and I’ve come up with a brilliant idea.”
“A one detention idea or a ten detention idea?”
~ The couple grinned at each other and they’re about the most unabashedly perfect thing she’s ever seen.
~
“Excellent. How good are the rest of you at keeping a secret?” Their only response was a massive, group, evil grin. 
~
“Getting back to the real world,” Clark said firmly, “in which none of our murder victims have turned to dust, why would anyone want easy access to swords?” 
~ “Classified ads?” suggested Cat. “Mad duellist seeks similar, object decapitation?” 
~ Pennyworth smiled and pulled his watch up his arm, revealing a small blue tattoo underneath. “Someone has to keep an eye on master Bruce, his liking for extreme sports will be the death of him one of these days… then I’ll have the job of explaining why it isn’t.”
~
“The Planet’s gossip columnist thinks you and Clark are planning a secret wedding this weekend and that’s why I’m away.”
“Monday’s going to be very disappointing for her then,” Lois commented.
~
Oliver groaned, “Nothing good ever comes after the ‘you’re a really great guy’ opener.”
~
“You’re not impervious to temperature,” she stated.
“That’s the answer – am I supposed to respond in the form of a question? What is a human?”
~
“And what exactly am I supposed to tell the doctor?”
“A mountain lion attacked you,” he came up with quickly.
“In Kansas, the flattest state in the country. How you’ve managed to keep your secret a secret for this long I’ll never know.”
~ “The claw marks weren’t too deep,” Raya interjected. Martha mouthed ‘claw’ to herself.
~
“I hate to be the one to tell you Smallville but the only sides to Lex are dark; anything else you see is a manipulation,” Lois said sadly.
~
“He’s beautiful,” Clark said while watching his son’s arm move back and forth.
“He’s a yellow blob,” Lois deadpanned.
“A beautiful yellow blob,” Clark countered
~
“Don’t you want time to prepare everything and enjoy some relaxing time before the baby comes,” he frowned.
“You’ve been reading ‘What to Expect When You’re Expecting’.”
“No I haven’t,” he denied.
“I saw it on your bedside table Clark….you had sticky notes in it.”
~
This is for the people who thought that, despite anything else that happened in HSM2, Zac Efron’s song “Bet On It”, which was filled with angry staring and finger pointing and some of the funniest dance moves I’ve ever seen in my life, quite possibly saved the movie.
~
“Do you remember Seth’s hybrid flowers? The ones that released pollen that made everybody in town…”
“Go freakin’ bug nuts?” he supplied helpfully.
“I was going to say: experience an altered state of consciousness,” she finished dryly.
“A wacko state,” he muttered under his breath.
~ River liked to talk to spaceships. They didn’t have any distracting subconscious thoughts to confuse her. Besides, they taught her all kinds of interesting things about space-time and folds in space and faster-than-light travel. And evasive maneuvers and docking and thrusters. And also about fish. (But that was another story entirely.) One time she’d gotten so involved in a conversation with an Alliance cruiser that she forgot to ask him if he could develop an imbalance in his port thruster so Serenity wouldn’t have to make quite so daring an escape. Wash had to do some tricky maneuvering and Mal taught her three new curse words and Kaylee apologized to her engines.
~ That ended up with the entire crew standing in a hallway yelling at each other while River did handstands and walked her feet along the wall. When the shouting reached its peak, she sidled up to Simon and whispered, “Offer him the candy.” 
~ “Apparently flooding is still a problem.” The light vanished as Minerva shrank down into her Animagus form, and he cast a Lumos himself and frowned down at her. “You plan to swim?” Her response involved an upwards leap and some clawing of his robe until she was perched neatly on one shoulder. It wasn’t—quite—the first time that she’d made a similar maneuver; at least this time he didn’t give immediate proof that even Animagus cats generally managed to land on their feet. “Why, precisely, am I the one who gets to slog through that?” Pointed glance down at his sturdy, sensible boots. “You know, should I ever have the time to perfect my own Animagus transformation, I’m vitally certain that it will be something large enough to eat you.”
~
“He is quite dashing and he seems quite enamoured of you.” She suddenly discovered how complicated it was to sit down without creasing one’s dress, and blushing—out of embarrassment at her gracelessness, she was sure— spent several minutes smoothing out her skirts. 
~
Marguerite “quite liked” Sir Percy not only for rescuing Armand from the scene of the massacre but for the small things that she was unable to fully explain to Rose or Madame Lavoisier: the way he laughed, half-shyly, as if unwilling to show it; the way he had asked-- begged permission, rather-- for the privilege of escorting her to and from the theatre until the Assembly reinstated civil law (simply because he was worried about her safety since Armand couldn’t escort her himself); the way he carried himself, so that, though he was over six feet, and never seemed to dominate a conversation or crowd a room; the way he looked when he genuinely smiled instead of his usual inane, polite little half- grin; the way his hair caught the light and acquired a golden sheen; the way he’d secretly press a few extra sous into a gamin’s hand; and even though a regular set of his clothes was more expensive than some houses in Provence, the way he never hesitated to shield her with his cloak when it was raining.
~
“He’s best friends with the Prince of Wales, I think. No doubt he’s a royalist,” Armand told her.  Marguerite thought of several very rude things she’d learned from eavesdropping on stagehands but eventually settled on giving the curtains one more whack before she walked across the room.
~
“Don’t need his permission. I’m of legal age. He’s not my guardian.”
“That would be River-speak for you haven’t even asked.”
~
He bowed and, with a smile, said, “You are a very strange woman.” 
“That’s the popular theory.”
~
“Why would they give us food for chickens?”
“Because we got chickens,” Jayne pointed at the crates. “Why we got chickens?”
~
Johnny rubbed his eye, trying to keep from crying in front of these men. O’Neill picked up a box of tissues and handed them across to him. “I really ought to dust this office more often,” he said obliquely.
~
“Look, it happens. Someone decides my dad has something and they grab him, or they grab all of us, or any combination of the group. We get away, the bad guys are foiled, and life goes on. Of course, usually, we’re not on another planet in the clutches of aliens.”
~ Lex was sane – terribly, utterly sane. It wasn’t madness that made him so dangerous, but that absolute sanity coupled with absolute ruthlessness. Wherever Kitty was, he hoped she had the sense to keep running.
~
Richard had turned crimson, muttering threats toward the columnist. “Boy-toy,” he growled. “In my own damn paper.”
~
“Cheer up. Not like you ever have to worry about that again. I’m not going to knowingly try to steal the girlfriend of a guy who can vaporize me with one look.”
~
“What is it with you and difficult women, Richard?”
“I had my lifetime allotment of easy ones in college?” The instant the words left his mouth, he groaned and dropped his face into his palm.
~
He pointed back at the house. Or at least what was left of it. It seemed, in their haste to leave the scene, she failed to notice the building simply giving up and collapsing in on itself. Before catching fire. As sirens began wailing in the distance, Inara said a word she very rarely said in English. The Doctor grimaced. “Fire’s a bit of overkill, yeah.”
~
“As long as you contribute a little something.” Jack looked like all of his birthdays came at once. 
“Really?” Inara glanced at the initiates peeking through the windows at them. 
Word travelled fast. “Oh, I’m sure we’ll be able to put your talents to use.”
~
“Don’t know about you, Gene,” Sam say, looking inordinately pleased with himself. “But I’m perfectly comfortable in my sexuality.”
“Poofter.”
“Neanderthal.”
~
The laughter slipped away in a breath and there was just the smile stuck to her lips like it hadn’t quite caught up with the alarm in her eyes.
~ “I was expecting pizza,” she said, pening the door.
“I must be a terrible disappointment.”
~ “Yes, well, we had a lot of passionate adventures together. We were lovers. He left me for her. They’ve been married for fifteen years.”
“Oh,” he said, very obviously searching his brain for the appropriate thing to say.
“I’m their son’s godmother.”
“Oh. Well, that’s all right then.”
~
“Seriously, though,” she said. “How do you cock up an entire universe? And why haven’t I noticed it’s cocked up?”
“Because you have a tiny human head.”
“Oh. So it’s something too vast for my tiny human head to comprehend, then?”
“Well, Sarah Jane, it is the Universe after all.”
“Perhaps you could explain it to me using very small words that will fit inside my head.”
“No. Stop asking.”
~
“There was a war. A really big war. The kind of really big that make words like ‘really’ and ‘big’ seem very silly.”
~
“May the world tremble before us.” Lori shrugged and picked up her paper. “They always did.”
~
“Yeah, the hypocrisy’s running pretty thick tonight. I just had Jo Sun tell me how much she wished we kept in contact for all those years.” “Who’s Jo Sun?” “Exactly,” she sighed.
~
The Doctor let out a whoop of delight and threw himself into the pilot’s chair on Serenity’s bridge. It seemed that the Doctor’s moral stance on not participating in major jewel heists for fear of screwing up the timeline was considerably weaker when they were a) in another universe b) especially fun jewel heists.
~ “It was a shotgun wedding She had the shotgun, not me. I don’t like shotguns.”
~ “So, is there anything funny going on around here? Any mysterious disappearances? Or appearances? Any injustices in need of correction?”
Rodney wonders if he’s crazy. He certainly looks like he could be. “No,” he says warily, bending his knees slightly so that he can run indoors if the man makes any crazy movements. “Not really.”
“Ah,” the man says. “Nice change, that.”
~
It has settled neatly in front of the Stargate and, inasmuch as a blue wooden box can, is giving off the rather smug impression that neither hell nor high water nor the violently obstinate nature of one Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard is going to budge it a single centimetre.
~
“Rodney?” Elizabeth is looking at him meaningfully from behind a line of Marines. “Would you care to explain the situation?”
“No! No, I wouldn’t!” Rodney snaps. “Because I don’t have any idea!”
~
“Weeell,” the Doctor says, looking shifty, and runs a hand through his hair. “Spacetime is a bit more durable than people give it credit for. More like rubber than tissue paper. Bendy,” he finishes lamely. Rodney thinks this sounds like a whole lot of elusive nonsense, and he should know, but he contents himself with scowling and echoing, “Bendy,” in tones that are as flat as he can manage.
~
“Oh, Rodney!” he says, sticking his head out through the door and causing Rodney to nearly jam a piece of wire though his own thumb in a fit of pure shock. “I just realised that I never thanked you for listening to—” He frowns. “Sorry, is this a bad time?”
~
“Right,” and thank God, he actually shuts up and just balances the circuitboard on one knee and points his stupid sonic screwdriver at it and presses a button. Blue light buzzes out from the tip and three seconds later there’s a shuddering roar from the generators and the shield soars upwards. It’s the most ridiculously unscientific thing Rodney has ever seen. He kind of wants to cry.
~
“This is opening night,” the Doctor says, looking around the bar with a pleased expression. “Tomorrow it’s going to be blown up by a rival intergalactic chain,” and then, before any words can come out of Rodney’s gaping mouth: “Hypervodka?”
~
The fifth drink is a very bright orange, a colour which Rodney mistrusts, but he cannot seem to communicate this to the robot which is pressing it upon him with increasingly alarmed beeps.
~
She lets him go on for at least ten minutes about the incompetence of all the other field scientists and how he’s sure John has been ending up in the infirmary with much greater frequency since he, Rodney, was banned from offworld missions. “I made a graph,” he adds darkly.
~
By the end of the fifth drink Rodney is entering the maudlin stages of his drunkenness, and trying to get the Doctor to drop hints about the future of applied wormhole physics; then the James Bond franchise; then humanity as a whole.
~
Rodney doesn’t like this version of the Doctor much, and he certainly doesn’t like the sensation of gathering stormclouds that has descended upon his office, but he charitably allows that the man is under a good deal of stress, what with the impending collapse of the universe and all, and so tries to keep the worst of the impatience out of his voice.
~ “I wondered how someone in public welfare would be able to read Sanskrit upside-down.”
“Doesn’t everybody?” The man clasped Daniel’s hand, and his grip was firm and dry. “It’s a useful skill.”
~
His whimsical tirade on false positives in Aztec crime-solving, however, was what inspired Daniel to invite him out for a beer.
~ “So you work in...” He made a gesture meant to be a euphemism for ‘alien warfare, technology and diplomacy’. “The industry?”
~ There were a series of clicks recognizable the universe wide to mean “I really don’t think we can be friends.” A Gellartaian Acoustician would have recognized them as belonging to the safety mechanisms of a series of semi-automatic mid-range projectile weapons driven by explosive powder, then stood about debating with him or herself as to the muzzle velocity. There are few entire species that fail to grasp the concept of personal survival in quite such a spectacular manner.
~
‘Oh no,’ said the man who appeared to be in charge, in that he was carrying the biggest gun. ‘Not until you tell us why you’re here, and how you penetrated our defences.’
‘Did we? They’re not very good defences, are they? Have you thought about new ones?’
~
It was immediately obvious that everyone within fifteen feet had been eavesdropping, because as soon as he admitted he was out of his jurisdiction, he heard several audible sighs and saw shoulders relax and hands move from holstered weapons up to drinks on the tables.
~ Zoe’s eyes aren’t as dead, aren’t as broken, but not by much and Jack never asks about the limp, growing slighter by the day, the shake in her hands occasionally. But he makes sure he never walks quietly around her, tapping feet against decking, a thousand little sounds.
~ “I destroyed the galaxy,” Crichton answered.
“Did you now?” Mal asked skeptically. “Because I’m fairly certain that I’d have heard about that.”
Defensively, Crichton shot back, “I fixed it.”
~
Rose frowned, but before she could ask how the Doctor knew she was with someone, there was a shout and the Doctor came sprinting past them, phone to his ear. He winked at her and then disappeared out the far door, followed by a load of rather unpleasant-looking blokes carrying guns. “Bloody typical,” she muttered, and hung up.
~ Jack grinned, and Rose bit back the urge to laugh. It probably wouldn’t be a terribly appropriate thing to do, considering they were surrounded by angry-looking men holding guns.
~ “Okay, thanks. Helps a lot!” He gave Rose and Jack a look saying that it obviously did not help in the slightest bit
~ “They wouldn’t let me build one in class,” she says. “They said I’d destroy reality. I told them that reality is a construction and I could only have destroyed it as they perceive it but they weren’t listening.” 
“There concern was justified,” the ice-man says. “You would have to simultaneously create a counteractive gravitational field or everyone would be irresistibly drawn into your wormhole - depending on the size of course.” 
“I thought of that,” she says. She points to a line closer to the bottom of the page. “Here.’ 
~ “Also, I’ve seen you naked.” 
“I’ve been trying to forget that,” he says. “The polite thing is to pretend you already have.” 
~ The time that followed was a blur to Jack, with Nyssa directing him to “hold this” and “press that” and read incomprehensible numbers from a screen. She scanned and poked and prodded, and at one point Jack had to hold a convulsing Doctor down while a machine buzzed and thrummed with such a high-pitched vibration that it made Jack’s teeth ache.
~ “It’s all right, Ace. He can’t reach you from there, and he can’t get up. He’s transfixed in place. A highly interesting symbiotic relationship. Is your neural system wired directly into the ship?” 
The creature blinked. “Yes, it is. I—” Suddenly it stopped, its eyelids lowering menacingly. “I mean, no! I could easily get up and hurt you, very badly, so you ought to answer our questions.” 
~
“Just …something in your eye? Like a tear?” Jim suggests.
“Noooo,” Andy says ardently. “Not like a tear. Like a –speck of…something… allergy-related. As opposed to emotion related.”
~
She’s not quite sure what she’s supposed to say to that without informing the guy that he’s got a sicko’s taste in reading material.
~ “There was massive bleeding, as I’m sure you knew, but I’ve healed most of that. You lost a kidney as well, and a piece of your left lung, but overall you got off fairly lightly in terms of internal injuries.”
~ Loftily he said, “You’ve been sailing the seas for ten years. Sailing the guilty and the innocent to a fate beyond.” Here Jack paused. “Have I mentioned how happy I am that I haven’t had to lay eyes on you these last ten years?”
~
“He’s in the infirmary right now, so unless he’s been programmed to kill nurses, it seems unlikely that he’s going to grow suddenly violent.”
“True,” Jack said, nodding. “Hey, Simmons, maybe you ought to go look in on him, show your concern.”
~
“Good news: I may have gotten the rift blaster working again. We just have to find a rift to test it on. Bad news: we have a rift to test it on.” 
~
“He doesn’t know you exist. There’s no reason to order bounty hunters to kill you.”
~
“I will do this, but your friend will still die.”
“Will you stop that! It’s really rude.”
~
“I have no home, but familiarity offers tactical advantage.”
~
“Ok, so I’m officially an enemy of the state.”
“So you erased all the security camera footage?”
“Either that or I just launched twenty nuclear missiles at Rhode Island.”
~
“Having a laugh?” she repeated hollowly. “A laugh?”
“Wrong thing to say, I think,” Julia muttered beside him. 
“Yeah, I got that, thanks.”
~
“Er... Teddy?” he asked oddly as he finished. “Why are you smelling me?”
“Er... sorry,” he said, confused at his own behaviour.
“Teddy? You’re still doing it.”
“Right.” Teddy backed up and sat up straight in his seat. “Sorry.”
~
“I’m fine,” Teddy insisted. “I’m just... odd. I’m an odd person, haven’t you noticed?”
“No, actually. Winnie’s the odd one. Julia’s the quiet one, I’m the witty one, and you’re the zen-type guy who doesn’t lose his temper and is relatively cheerful regardless of circumstance.”
~ “Gave me quite the headache,” Fauve glanced over at Sir Percy and Marguerite. “Still gives me headaches.”
“I can vouch for it,” her husband, Chartier added, which earned him a smack on the hand with Fauve’s fan.
~
“I’ve been in the East for the past two years. Odd’s fish. It’s rather difficult to attend a salon in Paris whilst livin’ in India.”
~
“Demme, I just grabbed the lad on m’way out. There isn’t anythin’ particularly special in all that.”
Marguerite turned to him incredulously. “You walked back into an Amphitheatre where the National Guards were firing on the people and you say that you just ‘grabbed Armand on your way out’?”
“Well, I grabbed him the second time I went out.” 
~ “We’re in hiding!” Lucille Desmoulins piped in brightly, taking the unoccupied chair next to her husband. She seemed rather thrilled by the idea of needing to go into hiding, as if she were a child that had just been told she was going on holiday.
Sir Percy stood, bowed, and shook Camille’s hand before sitting back down again. “Sir Percy Blakeney, baronet, at your service. I would say I’m delighted to meet you, but I think I shall have to pretend that I never met you the next time I see you.”
~
“Some complexions simply do not go with red at all—that is the only complaint I have with our new patriotic colours.”
Chauvelin pinched the bridge of his nose. “Forgive us for not taking fashion into account when we created a symbol to unify France.”
~
“I’m cravat-watching. Demme, it’s what I do whenever arguments or conversation grow ridiculous.”
~
“Then I shall go.” After a moment’s thought, Sir Percy added, “In fact, I’ll take some of my friends along. They’ve been complaining of how bored they are with martial law in place.”
~
“Well! If it isn’t my favourite band of anti-establishment fugitives,” exclaimed Phil with a smile. “What brings you all here this fine day?”
~
He jumped as his daughter shot past him with a gleeful squeal. She launched herself at Ginny and Neville, who promptly fell backwards onto Ron and Hermione, who toppled in turn until it was left to Harry to try and prop up the whole laughing mass of humanity. He didn’t bother to try – in an instant he found himself pinned down under myriad arms and legs, a mess of long blonde hair falling into his face.
~
“You are aware you could sell the remains of the basilisk and make enough money to buy a good portion of the Wizarding world?”
~
“Through less-than-creative editing, he’s managed to leave out the part when he mentions that the lines were done with a blood quill.”
~
“How long have you known?” the ex-Auror demanded as the gargoyle swung shut.
“A week and a half, I just thought tonight would be an excellent time to bring it up.” He kept his expression carefully even.
“Did I, or did I not, suggest that baiting me while you are in less than top form is not a particularly wise idea?”
~
The Doctor’s mouth stretched into a broad grin. “Alonzo? Is it really? That’s brilliant!” Catching the look on the poor man’s face, he swallowed any other remarks he might have made. Not the time for French puns. “Ah...never mind. D’you think you’re all right?”
~
“Not terribly surprised,” he admitted. “The fellows who, ah, jumped us at the carnival had a definite ‘no-witness’ aura about them.”
~
Jack clapped his hands together. “So, who feels like being part of a secret, evil plan?”
~
“Now, do you want to help me plot some fun revenge, or do you want to go back to scanning those micro-whatevers from PJY-934?”
Daniel mouthed from behind Jack, “Revenge! Say revenge!”
~
Frank snorted at that, “You can’t just rescue us.”
“Pessimist,” Jason scoffed. He turned to his wife, “It’s like he doesn’t know who we are.”
Erin raised her eyebrow as she turned to her husband, “He doesn’t.”
~
“You’re right.”
“What was that?” A big cheesy grin.
“I’m not saying it again.”
~
“Wow. So this is what an out-of-body experience feels like.” 
“This isn’t an out of body experience.”
“Why the hell not? I’m out of my body.”
“Because you’re in mine!”
~
“You realise,” Stark drawled, “that doing that would hurt you as much as it would hurt me?”
“Yeah, but tomorrow Henry’ll get me back in the right body and your nose will still be broken.”
~
Jack took a deep breath, and tried his best. “Zo, this is going to require a leap of faith on your part but-”
Her eyes widened. “Dad?”
“Or maybe it won’t.”
“Oh please, like bodyswap wasn’t on the list? We should have code-words, you know that, right? Clones, robot doubles, possession, hypnosis, alien possession…”
~
“How many times do I have to tell you? It wasn’t a curtain, it was the Veil of Death! Bit more impressive than mere drapery, that.”
~
“Do I know you, pal?” Jack drawled slowly, his eyes suggestively travelling down Methos’s body. “Because I’d think I’d remember you.”
“Will you stop that!” Methos snapped irritably.
“Stop what?”
“The innuendo, it won’t work. Better flirts than you have eyed me, my boy, and nothing is going to distract me. I want answers, damn it!”
“Better flirts than me? Really?”
“Byron, for one,” his companion piped up helpfully, throwing Methos a friendly smile. “Hi there! I’m the Doctor, and who are you today?”
“Michael…” Methos’s voice drifted off as everything clicked into place. “Bugger.” 
“Time travel,” the Doctor said sympathetically, “Plays havoc with your social life.”
~
“Why did you rescue me?” Methos asked abruptly. “They were hundreds of people running for their lives, why me?”
The Doctor’s grin widened as he clapped him on the shoulder. “Because you, my friend, said the immortal words.”
Methos groaned at the pun. “And which words were those? Get me out of here?”
“Actually, it was more along the lines of ‘and whose bright idea was it to let loose an army of psychotic peppershakers in London.’” 
~
“Do we have to? I don’t exactly have fond memories of the place.”
“Ah, watched one to many gladiator fights, did we?”
“Actually, it was more along the lines of being in one too many Gladiator fights,” Methos admitted.
The Doctor paused “Not exactly the smartest career choice.”
“Who said anything about choice?”
~
“A blood sample?” Methos sighed “Let me guess, we’re not talking about a nice, clean syringe, are we?
~
“I’ve got a sword, they’ve got laser weapons that can vaporize a human at thirty paces, do the math!”
“What’s life without a little adventure?”
~
“Ah, but where’s the fun in that?” he said. “This is much more exciting.”
Methos threw him a disbelieving look. “In case it has escaped your notice, we’re completely surrounded.”
“Look on the bright side; at least we’ve found their secret lair.”
~
“We don’t have any idea of what is on the other side,” he pointed out.
“True,” he agreed. “But, on the other hand, we know exactly what’s behind us. How could it get any worse?”
“You had to say that, didn’t you?”
~
“Romana, darling, you have to come and hear this,” he called over his shoulder. “I’ve just been accused of stealing.”
“Really? How quaint!” A blonde popped her head out the door. “Ooh, humans, how spiffy; are they going to drag us away in chains?”
~ “Ooh, freeloaders,” Romana said brightly. “I’ve never been called one of those before.”
~
“Oh, by the way,” he said, popping his head out. “You do realise that this galaxy is overrun by a predator species called the Wraith?”
“We got the memo,” John drawled.
“Jolly good, carry on!”
~
“What are you smirking at?”
Jack grinned at the knowing look on Martha’s face. “Sorry, that comes with a censorship rating.”
~ “Oh, sorry, was ‘don’t drink the local plonk, it’s got worms in it’ not warning enough?” 
“You could have mentioned that the worms were still alive,” Jack complained half-heartedly.
~
“Correction, I said I was looking for a really good thief…not so sure that’s you, seeing as you triggered that alarm pad under the rug—”
“I didn’t cross the rug,” she realised suddenly.
“You didn’t…oops, guess it was me, then.”
~
“Members of the public may only gaze upon the Duke of Manhattan with written permission from the senate of New New York.”
~
“It’s that man again! He’s my good luck charm! Come in, don’t be shy!” The Duke laughed. 
“Any friendship expressed by the Duke of Manhattan does not constitute a form of legal contract,” his assistant intoned gravely. 
~ “The front door’s no good, it’s been boarded shut. Pardon me, Your Majesty, you’ll have to leg it out of a window.”
~
“Master rebuilt me. My systems are much improved with new omni-link hyperflex facilities.”
“He replaced you with a brand new model, didn’t he?”
“Affirmative.”
~
“Nothing here… Well, nothing dangerous… Well, not that dangerous… Know what, I’ll just have a quick scan... case there’s anything dangerous.”
~
“What’s a horse doing on a spaceship?”
“Mickey, what’s pre-revolutionary France doing on a spaceship? Get a little perspective.”
~
“Oh, this is my lover, the King of France.”
~
“Any number that reduces to one when you take the sum of the square of its digits and continue iterating until it yields 1 is a happy number, any number that doesn’t, isn’t. A happy prime is both happy and prime. I don’t know, talk about dumbing down. Don’t they teach recreational mathematics anymore?”
~
“Right, okay, gotcha. … No, wait, hold on, completely lost!”
~
“What are you doing? It could be a burglar!”
“A burglar who rings the doorbell?”
~
“People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it’s more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.”
“Started well, that sentence.”
“It got away from me, yeah.”
~
“I tracked you down with this. This is my “timey-wimey detector”. Goes ding when there’s stuff. Also it can boil an egg at thirty paces. Whether you want it to or not, actually, so I’ve learned to stay away from hens; it’s not pretty when they blow…”
~
“Sorry, I’ve got a complex life. Things sometimes don’t happen to me in the right order. Especially weddings. I’m awful with weddings. Especially my own.”
~ “Gotta dash, things happening. Well, four things. Well, four things and a lizard.”
~
“Oh, good, good! Good! Good! Good! Good, good, good, good, good, good! Goood!!”
“It’s good apparently...”
~
“Bit of a hermit.”
“A hermit... with uh, friends?”
“Hermits United. We meet up every ten years and swap stories about caves. It’s good fun. For a hermit.”
~
“Before we go any further, who the hell orders pizza under the name of “Torchwood”?”
“Er, yeah, that would be me,” Owen called from the back. “Sorry, I’m a twat.”
~
“We know how to use it, but not how it happens, but if I were to guess, I would say that there was once a dimensionally transcendental chameleon circuit placed right here on this spot which welded its perception properties to a spatial-temporal rift. But that sounds kind of ridiculous. Invisible lift has got more of a ring to it, don’t you think?”
~
“All right, usual formation.”
“What’s the usual formation?”
“Varies.”
“How can the usual formation vary?”
~
“But, she said she had a boyfriend.”
“You people and your quaint little categories.”
~
“T’was a last kiss for the condemned man. Rather embarrassing, given we haven’t been killed.”
~
“Excuse me. Still am a doctor! I just don’t do it with patients anymore. It’s ideal. That was the bit I always hated.”
~ With that said, Spike turned around and walked through the wall of the office, pausing only briefly to stick his arm and head back through the wall, subsequently giving Woolsey the finger and telling him to perform an anatomically impossible action before he pulled his head back through the wall once more.
~
“That’s dog’s not senile, he’s just out of his mind and always has been,” Martha muttered darkly.
“Give him a break, Martha, he’s half-blind and stone deaf,” Ben scolded her. “Barkley’s fifteen years old, in dog years that’s…”
“Dead,” Martha retorted. “Which is what he’ll be if he ever waters my newel post again.”
“Good Lord, woman, that was a year ago!”
~
“Sorry,” Ron said, squinting in the sunlight. “Mum caught hold of me just before I Disapparated. Wanted to know if we needed snacks for today. You’re looking to buy a house, and she wanted us to bring snacks…honestly…”
~
“Dad keeps losing his car keys and finding them in bizarre places, like the refrigerator.”
~
“I started sneaking in a few Cleaning Charms, when I had the chance, because the place was just filthy, remember? Aberforth got angry with me for doing it, but I think he was secretly pleased to discover he actually had a floor under all that filth.”
~
“And I had to come back here and deal with Jason and Taylor and Kirk’s bottom—”
“Please, don’t ever say those words again.”
“—and I’m exhausted and decided to sit out here and wait for the fourth horseman to ride by and I didn’t mean to take it out on you.” 
~
She waved him off.  “Pick something.  If I like it, I’ll love it, if I hate it, I’ll mock it and make you miserable.”
~
“Well, this isn’t awkward.”  The Awkwardness Meter promptly jumped a few more notches, and Lorelai silently cursed herself for speaking.
~ “How do I look?”
“You always look great.”
She smiled.  “That bad?”
“We are still on a date.”
“Then I officially declare the date over.”
“Like you’ve spent three hours crying over Leo. You may want to,” he made some indefinite motion around his eyes, “with the mascara.”
~
“Hi.  So, anything you want to tell me?”
“Marijuana consumption has been down since Phish broke up.”
“More specifically?”
“I’ve got one less daughter living with me than normal.”
~
Lorelai heard a crash from the kitchen, followed by a muffled shriek and an “I’m okay!” and decided it was best not to investigate.
~ “There’s a banister there.”
“Yeah, I found it.”  She reached down to rub her calf with her free hand.
~
This was what motherhood had done to her.  She was watching Fox News on a Saturday waiting to hear about the terrible no-phone conditions which were surely covering half the Eastern seaboard.
~
“I,” he announced, “am going to become a grandfather.”
“Um, don’t you need to give that whole ‘father’ thing a spin first?”
~
“You’ll clog your arteries with that stuff.”
“Says the man who owns the deep fryer.”
~
“You’ll have to speak more slowly.  I’ve gone twelve hours without caffeine. Impossible, I know.”
~
“You must have me confused with your other mother; I do not give long-winded lectures.”
“The great tree-fall of ‘89?”
“You nearly broke your neck, and you’re my daughter, what were you doing on an athletic endeavour anyway?”
~
But the idea was kind of nice: marrying your friend. It wasn’t deeply passionate or wildly romantic or any of those other things; it was genuine and substantial and real. The sort of thing that lasts, like stone walls and steel bridges and wide, unpaved roads. The kinds of things that blend right into the landscape, but are there years later, waiting to be discovered, just where you left them.
~
Kirk had picked this opportune moment to test out a very small, and very loud, keychain alarm that he started to explain was an anti-theft device, not on the car, but on the keys, except that he hadn’t quite figured out how to deactivate it. Yet. At which point Luke merely looked at him, and he backed out of the diner so fast he knocked over a chair in the process.  
~
“You’re never nice. I mean, you’re nice, you just don’t say you’re being nice.”
He turned to look at her, a half-smile forming on his face.  “You can quit now, or keep going.”
“I’ll keep going.”
He sighed.  “Somehow, I knew.”
~
“You didn’t have to drink the lemonade.”
“You made it.”
“I make lots of things.”
“You don’t make anything.”
“Yes, I do!”
“Name something.”
“Samantha!”
“Doesn’t count.  And please don’t tell me how many hours you were in labour.”
“Does count, fourteen, and you’re stalling.”
~
“So, any hot new relationships you want to tell me about?”
“Well, there was that whole Dan Rydell thing, but it turns out he’s fictional.”
~
“Alright, tell me the whole story from the beginning.  But leave out any details that will send me to therapy.”
~
Sometimes, he thinks it would be easier to just kill her and have it done with. But then he’d have to find a place to hide the body.
~
“It has dials. And lights.”
“It makes toast.”
“But, it might not make that toast perfectly without the dials and lights. They might be vital to the proper toast-making operation.”
~
“You’re gonna have to back up the thought train there, because that did not make any sense.”
~
She didn’t give a damn if Luke’s world was grey, she would exist in nothing less than full Technicolor.
~
“So, let me get this straight. You want to have vampire slayer powers, but only so you’d be strong enough to change your own tires?”
“Yes, but my point is, in some other alternate universe, I already do.”
~
And then she uses her totally unfair mind powers to hypnotize him so he can focus on nothing but her lips. So he kisses her, very softly, and she tastes like chocolate as she kisses him back.
~
“I’m pretty sure I was offered complimentary blueberry pancakes,” Lorelai says. 
“Really, by whom?”
“Rory, tell the crazy man that he doesn’t want to mess with me since I’m about to drink my first real coffee in weeks.”
“I’m not getting involved in disputes between crazy people. But I’d like pancakes too, and I’m willing to pay for mine. And bacon, please.”
“Do you want bacon, too? I warn you, your interpreter seems to be shirking her responsibilities, so you might have to temporarily overlook the fact that I offered you decaf and address me directly.”
Lorelai sighs dramatically. “Just this once. Bacon would be lovely. And extra blueberries. Ooh, and a big glass of milk, but only if it’s cold.”
“Why wouldn’t it be cold?”
“Maybe someone left it out on the counter overnight.”
“This is a restaurant, not your kitchen.” 
Lorelai looks at Rory. “What is this “kitchen” the crazy man speaks of?”
“It’s that room,” Rory says vaguely. “You know.”

“Don’t do that!” shrieks Lorelai. “My life just flashed before my eyes. Oh, wait, that was your life, because I was going to kill you with your own muffin-tong-thingies. What the hell are those called anyway?” 
~
“And since only one of these restaurants is named after a dessert, I think we know which one has my vote.”
~ “Well, the nervousness rating is still at DefCon One, so I think I’ll start with a Long Island Iced Tea.” She giggles. “Did you hear that? DefCon One - I made a spooky government agency joke.” 
“Do me a favour and act like you don’t know me when they come to take you away.” 
~
“Do you realize how ridiculous this is?” Luke asks. “Coming into a huge concrete shopping mall just to shop at a corporate retail outlet that specializes in selling you “nature”, instead of just freakin’ going outside?” 
“Yes, dear,” says Lorelai, patting his arm. “Try not to frighten the other customers.” 
~
“It’s um, some kind of stone that I can’t remember the name of—” she begins. 
“Hematite,” Luke offers. 
“Right! See, I kept thinking “hermaphrodite” and I knew that was all wrong. 
~
“I’m not used to you seeing wear anything with short sleeves. Nice arms.”
“Oh. Thanks, I grew them myself.”
 ~
And then there is the matter of buttons and zippers and bra hooks to deal with, all of which are unusually cooperative, as though the universe has specifically sanctioned this event.
~
“If this is your last meal, I think you should do better than that, don’t you? It’s not like you have to worry about keeping your figure, so just go all out. Blueberries, whipped cream, a side order of sugar coated death.”
“And that would be different from your usual order, how?” asks Luke. 
“The impending doom would make it sweeter,” Lorelai replies.
“Great. Maybe I’ll start offering to stab people after their meals, so they enjoy it more.”
~ “I’ve had it. I’m dumping you for a girlfriend who isn’t Chaotic Evil.”
~
“He’s not quite as sensible as his resume may have made him seem.” “C’mon, I’m wearing my sensible pants today, I promise.”
~
“Hi, Cass,” Jack’s tone was droll. “How are you today? Why yes, J.J. and I would love for you to join us for lunch. Please, pull up a chair.”
~
“It’s not a good thing to have too many people involved. They can all point fingers at you.” “Jenny McCaroll took one of his papers last year and her boyfriend Chris has been harassing Fred’s little sister all month. Odds are better that you would tattle on me than Fred.” ~ “Thank you for calling Hell, where fire and brimstone offer escape from the chains. If you know the extension of the demon you wish to contact, enter the number now. If you wish to talk to our lawyers, press one. If you wish to talk to accounting, press two. If someone from accounting is already after you, I suggest you hang up and jump off a bridge. If you need a sweeper team to clean up your mess, press three. If you wish to have someone tortured, press four. If you are interested in joining our rich and backbiting team and are willing to sell you soul, the Human Resource Department can be contacted by pressing five. If you wish to speak to Lucifer himself, please dial extension 359. Thank you and have a good day. Remember, money can always soothe the itch of guilt.”
~ “J.J., you need to shut off your brain,” Jack complained. “And do what? Meditate? I tried that once. It was interesting and I figured out how base-eight math really works. Did you know that…”
~
“I still think we should blow it up now.” “Quit pouting,” J.J. teased. “I’ll let you play with the explosives at the next site.”
~
“Daniel! Seriously, do you see me being restrained enough to only damage the car I’m exploding?”
~ “General Hammond, I’d like to hire a non-alien, underage human who does not technically exist.”
~
“I do not mother hen.” “Of course not, sir. You just nag about our eating habits, our sleeping habits, our working habits . . .”
~
“Nope, I have a feeling that I don’t want to be in the same county when you get loose.”
~
“You look like hell.”
“Sheppard!” his female companion hissed.
Sheppard shrugged, unapologetic.  “He does.”
~
“Lady,” I growled.  “I’m on enough sides as it is.  I don’t need anyone else trying to kill me.”
~ “You be a good boy, you hear? None of this turning evil stuff,” he told the two-year-old.
~
“Have there been any?” He asked, a little weirded out by her casual use of the word apocalypse.
~ “You’re hiding in a ventilation shaft to get away from fictional plots against your life and you’re worried about pudding?”
~
“Yes, thank you, it had not occurred to me that letting him in sight of the dangerous aliens was a bad idea.”
“Not to mention his parents would kill you.”
~
“We didn’t frelling steal anything from you. That’s just an excuse to snatch the most powerful weapon in the galaxy. Which we don’t frelling have anymore!”
~ “We’re trying to kill as few people as possible.” D’argo rolled his eyes; they always said that.
~
“You’re not armed, are you?” asked Rodney, unexpectedly. 
“Only with from the shoulder down,” said Crichton, sounding more amused than offended by the question.
~ “Yes, how polite,” muttered Rodney. “Let’s have little conversations without explaining them to everyone else.”
~ “You’re giving them back their data.” John was pretty sure that was what had come out of the meeting earlier.
“Which we never took in the first place.” Oh yeah. John bit back the ‘you’re screwed’ that was on the tip of his tongue. 
~ The two of them smiled pleasantly, Teyla in the practiced manner of a diplomat and John with the edginess that set most people to chasing them with spears.
~
“I have interrupted you in the pleasure of pressing the doorbell. I shall close the door so you may do so.”
~ “Guess that’s why you’re the Boss Man.”
“I’m not the— Why are you calling?”
~ “I’m not going to hurt you. And I think you got odds and projectile weapons on your side.”
~ “You’re giving me a test?” He couldn’t quite believe it.
“The last person I talked to about cutting this thing out didn’t know a fever from evil spirits and wanted to drill a hole in my skull.”
~
“Exuding chemicals-interesting or third nipple-interesting?”
She gave him a strange look. “Abnormal brain activity interesting.”
~
“You have an acid flood?” Crichton’s incredulous tones broke into the argument.
Rodney turned and noticed him for the first time. “Yes. And what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be in shackles?”
~ “You wouldn’t harm me. There are rules against such things somewhere.” 
The Colonel looked thoughtful for a moment. “Sir, maybe he is talking about the ‘shoot first ask question later’ rule.”
~
“She’s been scribbling in her diary from the moment I walked in.”
“Maybe she’s just creative…”
“It’s the same sentence over and over again. Now, I don’t know what that sentence is, but there is no configuration of words that makes that behaviour acceptable.”
~
“Yeah, well that’s a stupid house to rob.”
“Does anyone live up to your standards? Maybe they can get a hold of the burglar’s number and you can call, tell them how disappointed you are.”
~
“Hello” is the actual word Angela uses to answer, but Ryan’s pretty sure what she’s saying is ‘The two of you are going to burn in hell.’
~
“Stupefied. By me; I know of very few curses that start with ‘Avada.’”
~ “And you, Severus, go do something about that hair. Leopardskin doesn’t suit you, and I could see it weighing against you when you give your formal statement.”
~
“As far as I know, he’s only ever delivered one baby.” She thought about that a moment, and added, “Though since he did it in the middle of a god-awful firefight, I suppose that’s something.”
~
“How’d they find you anyhow?”
“The large flashing sign over my head that reads ‘meddler,’” came the bland reply.
~ Ron was not quite sure what made the figurines ‘official’, but he was certain that Harry would not have sanctioned them. Ron entertained himself briefly by envisioning Harry’s reaction when he discovered that he was an action figure.
~ “No, I do not live in the forest. And may I ask what you think you’re doing, traipsing about the woods and kicking people?”
~
The photo might have looked deceptively romantic, were it not for the expression of extreme discomfort bordering on terror on his face.
~
“We were fourteen and in love. And now we’re older and just friends.”
~
“Hey guys, is this normal? Day turning into night sort of end-of-the-world type weather? Is this... Guys?”
~
“Right. Well, while you were keeping the guards out, I panicked and started pushing buttons. Cue bright shiny light; enter Germany.”
“Germany,” she repeated flatly.
~ “It’s me! Really! I can prove it to you!” Xander thought frantically for something. ”Wait! Umm...oh! Ask me a question!”
“Where’s Xander!” She demanded again, advancing with the axe. 
~
“It wouldn’t be an irrational fear of bees if I could just pull myself together, would it?”
~ “You don’t look like a god,” she said conversationally.
~ “I think I’ve got something resembling a plan that doesn’t end with us all dead.”
~
“I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster, so I took the gun. Thought it might come in handy. Guess what. I just shot a bear!”
~
“If you didn’t see it, how do you know it wasn’t a dinosaur?”
“Cause dinosaurs are extinct.”
“Oh, yeah, good point.”
~ “You two run away fantastically. I’m glad my diversion spared you. I was only stung several hundred times.”
~
“Dudes... listen. Our lives suck! We’re lost on an island, running from boars and monsters... freakin’ polar bears!”
“Polar bears?”
“You didn’t hear about the polar bear?”
~ “So, I had an idea. I’m out here looking for some psycho with Scott and Steve, right. And I’m realizing... who the hell are Scott and Steve?”
~
“How am I doing? With week two of heroin withdrawal? Or how am I doing with Claire being abducted by the freak who tried to kill me?”
“I gave you aspirin for the heroin withdrawal.”
~ “You hit like a ponce.”
~
“I’ve never had a one-night stand. Bottom’s up, Sailor!”
“I gotta drink for each one?”
~ “Maybe it’s a monster. Maybe it’s a... pissed off giraffe, I don’t know.”
~
“You only asked four people?!”
“I asked the whole sodding camp! Nobody knows their blood type! I don’t know my own bloody blood type!”
~
“Hey, brought you something to eat.”
“What’s in it, chloroform?”
~
“Well, you know, the whole fugitive thing. He doesn’t know? Well how am I supposed to keep straight who knows what around here? I mean, Steve didn’t even know about the polar bear.”
~
“Yeah, I wanted to help, but that was before Montand lost his frickin’ arm.”
~
“Yeah, Arnzt. Your name’s hard to pronounce.”
“Well, I know a bunch of ninth graders who have no trouble saying it.”
~
“Good idea dude, you go look in the burning death hole”
~
“Well I guess I know why the shark is hanging around. Your shoulder.”
“Oh, well I’ll just stop bleeding then.”
~
“When I say, “move” you move. When I say “stop” you stop. When I say “jump”, what do you say?”
“You first.”
~
“She pick-pocketed your gun? How’d she do that?”
“Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn’t be able to do it, now would she?”
~
“We were caught in a net.”
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
“It means we got caught in a net.”
“Is that what they’re calling it these days?”
~ “Two days after I found out that I had a fatal tumor on my spine, a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky. If that’s not proof of God I don’t know what is.”
~
“The Man from Tallahassee? What is that some kind of code?”
“No John, unfortunately we don’t have a code for “there is a man in my closet holding a gun to my daughter’s head”. Although we obviously should.”
~
For her part, Sheila was glaring at Logan as though she wanted to chop him into tiny pieces. To be fair, that was how she glared at everyone, but still.
~
“I said a mild explosion. That wasn’t a mild explosion!”
“Well, compared to what else I can do…”
“And I said leave us plenty of time to get away.”
“Corrin, love, we had 8.7 seconds to spare.”
~ I plastered on a fake grin and said, “Deadly poison! Try some!”
~ My opinion of Celeste Kane jumped by half a notch. I didn’t know she was even aware of the existence of powdered lemonade.
~ “Wereskunks, if they existed, would be proof positive of the nonexistence of God.”
~
“So, you burned down a gym?”
“I don’t suppose you’ll believe my smoking mice story?”
“Nope. I have it on good authority that mice only use chewing tobacco. It’s hard for their little paws to work the lighters.”
~
“How did you know? And if you say any variant on the words ‘I’m a detective,’ I’m going to hurt you.”
~
When it was obvious that no answer was forthcoming, she turned to him, raising her weapon, and asked, “Where is my team?” And that was the most striking thing so far, because the question was always, always, “Where am I?”
~ “Are you them?”
“Is that the island nut greeting for hello?”
~ “We have a problem.”
Her reaction was instant. “How big and how do I kill it?”
~
“It’s not like I pray to any particular deity or anything. Most of the deities we’ve seen haven’t been much smarter or nicer than your average fifth grader.”
~ “You asked,” she said, voice catching on a sob. “No one ever asks, even when they try to make me better.”
“I do remember some of the manners my mother taught me. It’s rude to poke around other people’s brains without permission.”
~
“He’s delusional,” Fudge said.
“Of course, I’m imagining that my eye, my kidney, and a rather large portion of my left arm are missing. Would you care to look?”
~
The winner of the Best Essay looked very surprised when Reggie presented her with a hatbox instead of a stationery set or a book, and when she and her friends gathered around to discover what could be in the intriguing box, the winner was so delighted to discover that it really was a hat she almost forgot to return to the platform to read her winning essay aloud.
~ “If I said something that made you mad, you’d say!”
“I’d say,” Mad Ross replied, with a glint in his eye. “Or I’d punch your nose. Either way, you’d know.”
“So there’s no call to be mad at a body if he’s said summat you didn’t like, and you didn’t tell him, is there?” Michael continued, sounded aggrieved. “And ‘specially if it was months and months ago, and you never said, till it’s too late for him to remember what he did say, much less why you should be mad about it!”
~
“I never thought you were a coward, Brigadier.”
“I was, in my time, considered a good strategist, my lady. And a good strategist never attacks a fortified stronghold. Ever.” He spread his empty hands in a gesture of conciliation. “Besides, I am at a disadvantage. My daughter-in-law and granddaughter will be invited for the ball. If they were to discover that I dared to be against it, however briefly, I will have to watch for arsenic in my brandy.”
~
“You did what to whose dog for how many jellybeans?!”
~
“Lung puncture and abdominal blade injuries first.”
Alice raised an eyebrow as she slit through the patients clothing. “I thought she was injured in a car accident?”
“She’s had a busy day.”
~ “What have I told you? Don’t shoot at people who have appointments. When I have to meet them, I’d like them to not be on fire.” 
~
“He was swerving to avoid a tree. He was unsuccessful.”
~
“True or False: If I were to stand on high ground in Key West with a good pair of binoculars, I would be as informed as I am right now.”
“Well, that’s true.”
“The intelligence budget’s money well spent, isn’t it?”
~
“He rode his bicycle into a tree, CJ. ‘The President, while riding a bicycle, came to a sudden arboreal stop’? What do you want from me?”
~
“17 across. Yes, 17 across is wrong... You’re spelling his name wrong... What’s my name? My name doesn’t matter. I am just an ordinary citizen who relies on the Times crossword for stimulation. And I’m telling you that I met the man twice. And I recommended a pre-emptive Exocet missile strike against his air force, so I think I know how—they hung up on me…”
~
“You’re supposed to tell them about the building and its history. Do you need anything?”
“I need someone to tell me about the building and its history.”
~
“Victory is mine, victory is mine, great day in the morning people, victory is mine. I drink from the keg of glory, Donna, bring me the finest muffins and bagels in all the land.”
“This is going to be an unbearable day.”
“Someone give me a river to ford, a serpent to slay.”
~
“I’ve got an intelligence briefing, a security briefing, and a 90-minute budget meeting all scheduled for the same 45 minutes. You sure this is a good time to talk about my sense of humour?”
~
“CJ, on your tombstone it’s gonna read ‘Post hoc ergo propter hoc.’”
“Okay, but none of my visitors are going to be able to understand my tombstone.”
“Twenty-seven lawyers in the room, anybody know ‘post hoc, ergo propter hoc’? Josh?”
“Ah, post, after hoc, ergo, therefore... After hoc, therefore something else hoc.”
~
“I’ll kill you with my shoes!”
~
“Your wife’s beautiful…how’d you get her to marry you?”
“Hypnosis.”
~
“How do I know this is a flu shot? It might be the start of a military coup. I want the Secret Service in here.”
“In the vent of a military coup, what makes you think the Sercret Service will be on your side?”
“Now that’s a thought that’s going to fester.”
~
“I am not frightened. I’m going to blow them off the face of the earth with the fury of God’s own thunder.”
~
“I don’t plan on getting busted—”
“As opposed to the other people who do?”
~
“Ok. Here’s what I’m going to do—”
“Hide in your office?”
“No. I’m not going to hide in my office. I’m going to go into my office and devise a strategy. That is what I do. I’m a professional… But if she calls, I’m at the dentist. I’ll be back in an hour.”
~
“What this is about, Sam, is you’re a high-profile, very visible, much-noticed member—”
“You just said three things that all mean the same thing.”
~
“No, Sam, when I say ‘one other thing’ it means we’re not done, that there’s one other thing.”
“You know, I’m resenting the hell out of this conversation right now.”
~
“You know what, feel free to sue our asses. I’ll represent you if you like.”
~
“He’s a real terrific kid. I’m sure he’d be articulate if he weren’t terrified.”
~
“Ordinarily we get help from inside Syrian intelligence.”
“So what’s the problem?”
“We just blew up Syrian intelligence.”
~
“I’m curious about the President’s farm in Manchester. The property value increased $750,000. What’s that due to?”
“Secret Service improvements. The property now includes a helipad and the ability to run a global war from the sun porch.
~
“Leo, wouldn’t this time be better spent plotting a war against a country that can’t possibly defend itself against us?”
“We can do that later, Toby. Right now I’m talking about President Andrew Jackson.”
“Actually, right now, you’re talking about a big block of cheese.”
~
“Sorry, we’re late. Is it “Total Crackpot Day” again?”
~
“It’s not so much that you cheat sir, its how brazenly bad you are it. In Florida, playing mixed doubles with me and C.J., you tried to tell us your partner worked at the American Consulate in Vienna. It was Steffi Graf.”
“I’ll admit the woman bore a striking resemblance to her.”
“You crazy lunatic, you think I’m not going to recognize Steffi Graf when she’s serving a tennis ball at me?”
~
“We’d like the White House to pay a little more attention to UFOs.”
“Are we paying any attention at all right now?”
“No.”
“Thank God. Like we don’t have enough problems with the First Lady and her Ouija board.”
~
“Gangs of roving people. Beheading those they suspect of being sorcerers. You know with... what’s that thing that Death carries?”
“A scythe.”
“They’re doing it with a scythe.”
~
“This is a stand off with federal officers. A peaceful settlement is “put your guns down, you’re under arrest.””
~
“Ultimately, it is not the nuts that are the greatest threat to democracy, as history has shown us over and over and over again, the greatest threat to democracy is the unbridled power of the state over its citizens.”
“This isn’t abstract, Mandy. This isn’t a theoretical problem. The FBI says come out with your hands up, you come out with your hands up. At which point, you’re free to avail yourself of the entire justice system.”
~
“No, I’m asking you to accompany me to see an internationally renowned opera company perform a work indigenous to its culture.”
“Right, and in what way will it distinguish itself from a date?”
“There will be, under no circumstances, any sex for you at the end of the evening.”
~
“You guys are idiots. Did you know that?”
“In our own defense, we actually do know that.”
~ “A book which if I was stuck with it on a desert island I still wouldn’t read it. “The Adventures of James C. Adams, Mountaineer and Grizzly Bear Hunter of California.” I believe I would eat this book before I read it.”
~ “I was watching a television program before, with a kind of roving moderator who spoke to a seated panel of young women who were having some sort of problem with their boyfriends - apparently, because the boyfriends had all slept with the girlfriends’ mothers. And they brought the boyfriends out, and they fought, right there on television. Toby, tell me: these people don’t vote, do they?”
~
“And I see we’re spelling ‘hallowed’ with a pound sign in the middle. The pound sign is silent?”
~ “I’m anticipating any joke you could possibly make right now, and I’m not finding any of them funny.”
~
“We never have our chats anymore, Toby.”
“What chats?”
“Our late night chats.”
“Did we ever do that?”
“No.”
~
“No, I did not. Let me be absolutely clear, I did not do that. Except, yes, I did that.”
~
“How you know the First Lady wasn’t going to be naked when you came in here? Come to think of it, where the hell is my wife?”
“Argentina, sir.”
~
“What, I’m not coming in the car?”
“No, and you know why? Because you made fun of the guacamole.”
“I didn’t!”
“I could tell you were thinking it.”
“Fair enough.”
~
“There is a population in this country that seems to focus so much time and energy into this conversation, so much so that I am forced to ask this question - is there an epidemic of flag burning going on that I’m not aware of?”
~ “How about you be the good cop and I be the cop that doesn’t go to the meeting?”
~
“You have to go to the meeting. I told them you’d be at the meeting. If you’re not there they’re going to start right out insulted.”
“I go to this meeting, there’s a decent chance they’re going to end up insulted.”
~
“‘On schedule’ is going to be my middle name from now on. Seriously. I’m having it legally changed.”
“What was it before?”
“Norman.”
~
“I am smiling, I am laughing, I am enjoying the people I work with - I have to snap out of this. What’s on your mind?”
“I want you to help me get the Chinese to give us a new panda bear to replace LumLum.”
“Well, that did the trick.”
~
“I’m sorry. I’m going to have to... I hung in there as long as I could, but you long since passed the point when I stopped caring. If you’re curious, it was right around raisin muffin.”
~ “Yes, I meant, you’re in charge of this, in the sense that you’re subordinate to me in every way.”
~
“Make him the Ambassador to Paraguay.”
“What do we do with the Ambassador to Paraguay?”
“Make him Ambassador to Bulgaria.”
~
“Do you have any medical conditions?”
“Well, I’ve been shot.”
~
“Yes, Steve, I can tell you those things, because when I said that we weren’t releasing any information whatsoever, I meant except than his name, his address, his ethnicity, and what we think his motives are.”
~
“Actually. I have a thing. I have a thing I was going to mention, just a proposal to throw out there. Instead of buying these ships? Don’t buy these ships. Buy other ships. Better ships. Ships that won’t fall apart within a week. That’s my idea.”
~
“I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I have you here. I’m interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. She’s a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, always cleared the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for her be? While thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here’s one, because we’ve got a lot of sports fans in this town: touching the skin of a dead pig makes one unclean. Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins still play football? Does the whole town really have to be together to stone my brother John for planting different crops side by side? Can I burn my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two different threads?”
~
“No, I’m disagreeing with you. It doesn’t mean I’m not listening or understanding what you’re saying. I’m doing all three at the same time.”
~
“I get sick when I drink too much.”
“I get drunk when I drink too much.”
~ “In the following days, we will be meeting with Reverend Al Caldwell, members of Beijing’s Embassy and INS agents. The President has asked Josh Lyman and Sam Seaborn to run these meetings so it’s entirely possible that by week’s end we’ll have alienated Christians, China, and our own government.”
~
“They sent two turkeys. The most photogenic gets a Presidential pardon and a life at a children’s zoo. The runner-up gets eaten.”
~
“I can’t pardon a turkey. I’ll tell you what I can do. I’m drafting this turkey into military service.”
~
“What happened three weeks ago?”
“I don’t know what you’re referring to.”
“I don’t know what I’m referring to either, but the people you work with became concerned with your behaviour three weeks ago.”
“Well, I’ve been concerned with their behaviour since long before that.”
~
“You send a Christmas card to everyone who writes a letter to the White House and around a million people wrote you letters this year.”
“Okay, but some of those were death threats.”
“They’ve weeded those out.”
~
“I am not threatened by his brains, his looks or his charm. He is, however, a lunatic Brit and I’m grateful there’s an ocean between us.”
~
“Red meat has been found to cause cancer in white rats. Maraschino cherries have been found to cause cancer in white rats. Cellular phones have been found to cause cancer in white rats. Has anyone examined the possibility that cancer might be hereditary in white rats?”
~ “Never has a war been so courteously declared. It was on parchment with calligraphy and said, “Your highness, we beseech you on this day in Philadelphia to bite me, if you please.””
~ “It’s true, sir - America does not want Dr. Kevorkian to lead the country. We’ve got polling data on that.”
~
“I would have been a great astronaut.”
“You’re afraid of heights, speed, fire, and small enclosed spaces.”
~
“A subpoena is just a legal agreement to produce certain testimony and documents.”
“Yeah, but isn’t that like the way a mugger uses a gun to produce your wallet?”
~
“If you’re in the middle of something, I can come back.”
“We’re eliminating genocide. What are you doing?”
“Eliminating the penny. So, I’ll come back.”
~ “I’ve got to tell him I lost a submarine. Can I make something up like say ‘what if a friend of mine hypothetically...’”
~
“Well, there are some concerns. Two main bacterial problems are salmonella and camplyobacter jejuna.”
“All right. Well, first of all, I think you made the second bacteria up, and second of all, how do I avoid it?”
~ “Sir, this isn’t a secure call, so I’m going to say to the 17 global intelligence agencies that are listening in that he was kidding just then.”
~ “Call and ask her out? No. ‘Cause there’s a potential she says no and then I have to move someplace where it’ll never be spoken of again.”
~
S- “You’re trying to tell me that linear algebra was fun….oh, wait, it was. But, you’re trying to tell me that multi-variable calculus was fun?”
K- “I enjoyed it.”
~
“I don’t get it. How can you not want to see the butter cow? You understand it’s a life-size cow made entirely of butter. There’s also a butter Elvis and a butter Last Supper which has, I swear to God,…It’s got butter on the table right there between butter James and butter Peter.”
~
“Okay, I’m going to go away, and you know, not be in this area for a while.”
~
“Yeah, it’s hand-carved. It belonged to the Prime Minister’s grandfather, who used it to play with Lord Mountbatten.”
“I’m surprised that she gave it away.”
“Nah, we boosted it on our way out of the palace. I’ve got some little bottles of shampoo and conditioner, too.”
~
“May I inquire, Mr. President - the first thing that attracted you to Abigail - was it her magnificent breasts?”
“You know, there are places in the world where it might be considered rude to talk about the physical attributes of another man’s wife.”
“My god. Really?”

“You went over my head and you did it behind my back!”
“Quite the contortionist am I.”

The Princesse de Lamballe was known for her excessive sentimentality, her virtue, her beauty, and her utter stupidity. Marguerite herself saw the veracity of popular rumor when the Princesse flung her arms into the air, cried, “Oh!”, and burst into tears. Sir Percy’s smile turned awkward and Marguerite gave him a Look that quite clearly expressed her negative feelings about the entire situation. It wasn’t as good a vent as breaking her fan, but it achieved something close to the desired result; he had the good grace to look abashed and very sheepish. It was, oddly enough, a very endearing sort of look. “Oh!” the Princesse cried again, very unhelpfully.
~
“Women of a certain ilk—” it was rather apparent that the Princess had no idea what the word ‘ilk’ meant.
~ Because Sir Percy was so generally inclined and so apt at making himself agreeable to everyone, it was easy to forget that he was six-foot odd, broad-shouldered, and heavily muscled from his favoured pursuits of riding, hunting, fencing, and boxing. It was quite a sight to see when he suddenly reminded everyone around him that he was a) very, very tall and b) very, very strong.
~ “There’s a difference between dropping altitude and crash landing, you crazy Scot!”
~ He was smooth, and cool on the outside; on the inside, he was burning up a million stars and feeling like nobody could see it.
~ “If you’re not scared at the thought of a human brain being controlled remotely, then it could be this prototype is finally starting to work.”
~
“I think the thing that was causing the town to disintegrate has jumped to people. We could all end up like this…I hate this day.”
~
“Honestly!” A new voice sounded from behind the hedge. “Jack, will you quit mucking about?”
The composed, professional mask of the man at Sarah Jane’s doorstep suddenly crumbled into a broad grin. “Oh, come on,” he protested, rolling his eyes good-naturedly as he turned to face whoever was standing out of her line of sight. “It was going to be fantastic! I must say, though, I didn’t think I could keep up the ‘ominous, intimidating government agent’ shtick for much longer.”
~ “Ah, yes,” said the Doctor, “but I do so love impossible. Good friends, impossible and I.”
“You’d date it,” Jack remarked, sidling in the door, “if only it’d give you the time of day.” 
~
“I’m going to a place called Rare Books. Know what they sell?”
“Fishing tackle?”
~
“I made a mental list.”
“Well, I made an actual list.”

“You should bring a lawyer.”
“I am a lawyer.”
“Well, you should bring a real lawyer.”

“You’re going to owe me a big favour…ok, we’ll be even…ok, I’ll do this for you and many more favours and we’ll be even.”

“You’re just trying to cover up the fact that you’re enjoying it.”

“I’d like to remind you that you’re under oath.”
“And I’d like to remind you that that’s the seventh time you’ve reminded him since he sat down.”
~
“Are you taking the pills or are you just carrying them around in your pocket.”
~
“You know, I never saw you study in med school. Do you even know what you’re listening for right now?”
~
“I really don’t anticipate the Capitol Building exploding.”
“What percentage of things exploding was ever anticipated?”
~
“Unless a war breaks out somewhere, I’ll be spending much of my day talking about bananas.”
~
“There’s a town in Alabama that wants to abolish all laws except the ten commandments. They’re going to have a problem enforcing them. Coveting thy neighbour’s wife for example. Plus, if I were arrested for coveting my neighbour’s wife I’d probably bear false witness.”

“I’ve had some pain. For about a month now…”
“And when will it go away?”
“When I die, apparently.”

“We’ve been navigating by the north star which turned out to be the Delta shuttle from JFK. We’re lucky we’re not in Nantucket.”

“Hey, there’s a store. I could pull over and ask them where the Westley police station is…”
“Or you could just pull over there at the Westley police station…”
~
“Sir, you’ve arrested a federal judge who’s going to be the President’s nominee for the Supreme Court. You should get the phone. That’s going to be the governor of Connecticut.”

“Donna, call Toby’s office and see if he was listening—”
“Where the hell is he?”
“Never mind…”
“Have you hit your head? Have you fallen down and hit your head on something hard?”
~
“I thought he was on vacation. I thought he was on vacation in Nova Scotia. They found him in Nova Scotia?”
~
“Mr. President, we experienced a few public relations…what’s the word…catastrophes while you were away last night.”
~
“You’re a what?” She looked at the man like he had just grown a second head.
“A vampire hunter,” he replied, a bit sheepishly. He wasn’t used to this kind of scrutiny. She hadn’t looked very impressed either when he had appeared next to her, casually swirling his stake.
~ “I wanted to be clear.”
“Yeah. And I think if he didn’t get it, the nice men with large guns escorting him off the base will reinforce the concept.”
~
“A weird outfit does not make you a different person, Smallville. It just makes you Clark in a weird outfit.”
~ “Besides I’m not going to throw you.” He sagged with visible relief, but his horror to returned at the next words, “I’m going to toss you!”
~
“It’s my day of jubilee!”
“I despise you and everything you stand for.”
“Ok, my day was a little bit better a few seconds ago.”

“I’ve drafted a letter of resignation.”
“Well you’re not going to give it to him because that would deny me the pleasure of throwing you out through a plate glass window.”

“You’ve been a professional political operative your whole life?”
“Well, there was a brief period I was in elementary school.”

“Don’t. Ain’t got time to carry you.”

“Could I have a couple of aspirin or at least a weapon to kill people with?”

A woman began screaming, completely incoherently. If it was a language at all, it was completely unknown to me.

“They’re a bagpipe regiment?”
“They’re three guys from Delaware who happen to play bagpipes.”

“And by state of the art, you mean a room with electricity…”
~
One particular tiny object, which he passes on without thought or ceremony, catches her eye, and she holds it in the palm of her hand in astonishment, causing the Doctor to drop a jar of marmalade onto his foot instead of into her outstretched hands, and tut at the hold-up.
~ “Oh, you’re kidding me. You were married?”
“Well, if you want to put it in human terms,” he offers, unhelpfully.
~
“Legal contracts are only binding in the planet on which they were drawn up. …Or within the surrounding galaxy, if you’re very unlucky,” Jack explains. “Found that one out the hard way.”
~ Of course, she really did steal his fob watch, so in this particular case, he would have been right to suspect her.
~ A cool, collected female voice, far too calm in amongst all this death and destruction, announces the floor to which they are headed.
~
He knows he would rip apart the universe for her, but the thought that someone else actually did …well, that’s something else entirely.
~
“Right then, glad we sorted that out. You can tell Jackie when we next visit. Yes, mum,” he mimics, voice ridiculously high. “The Doctor does know me, probably better than you do, thankyouverymuch, and that statement now includes his awareness that feeding me clams is a very, very bad idea that should never, ever, ever be attempted without a sick bucket in the near vicinity.”
~
“I did introduce you,” said Martha. “Don’t you remember?” 
“Beer,” said Tom, succinctly.
~ “It’s only mornings, so you’ll still have plenty of time to destroy things.”
~ “Wonderful!” said the doctor. “Brilliant place. Gizmo’s and gadgets everywhere. It’s like working in a sweet shop.”
Martha smiled. “I do work in a sweet shop, and you don’t notice me with a soppy grin, do you?”
~ “Of course I’m sure. I give you my solemn oath that I did not babble, start any fires, insult anyone or blow anything up. Including aliens.”
~
“Just...let’s get out of here, and fast, all right? I want to faint somewhere I’m not going to get locked up.”
~ “The noise has started again,” Susan said apprehensively. “It’s louder then before. Louder and therefore closer.”
“Run?” Edmund suggested calmly.
“Run.” Replied Peter just as calmly.
~
Rose ignored the goons and the robots in favour of giving the investigative reporter a hug.
~
He reached into his overcoat pocket and brought out his sonic screwdriver setting it on ‘Setting 234’ also known as ‘The blow it up’ setting.
~
Sarah Jane thought that a perky woman in a pink hoodie had no right to look so menacing.
~ Bone looked at the strangely bouncy man’s credentials.
~ Rose sighed, “I’ve got a PH.D in physics and still I get carded.”
~
“Do you still have the blasters in your purse?” Sarah Jane nodded. “And it never occurred to you to, I don’t know, threaten them with it?”
~
He didn’t find it to his liking. Things with the word death in them were rarely good. Never good really. Okay, maybe twice.
~ “If he tries anything shot him in the leg.”
“What sort of anything?”
“Moving things with his mind. Choking the life out of you from a distance. That sort of anything.”
~
“Magic!” Came the cheeky reply.
~ “I don’t prance! I stride and sometimes when the spirit moves me I saunter. And scruffy-looking? I’m very dapper I’ll have you know.” ~ “Stop that! Every time you two get together it becomes ‘Make Fun of the Doctor Day.’”
“That’s not true,” Rose protested through her giggles. “Every day is ‘Make Fun of the Doctor Day.”
~ I glared at him, and started to compose a truly epic rant in my head.
~ The bartender reached for the bottle of single malt scotch and poured a dollop into a shot glass--only to put substantially more in when the Englishman gave him a stern look--and placed the glass onto the bar before retreating.
~ He hesitated for a moment, and then added, “Almost no one calls me Kal. But not,” he added pensively, “because I’ve ever objected.”
~
“Look,” he replied mildly, “I know cult etiquette much better than I do normal human interaction. It’s rude.”
~ “I don’t really publish news anymore. I just find things out, and then keep them to myself. Saves on ink.”
~ “You’re calling my cooking ‘muck’?!”
“You call it ‘cooking’?”
~ “Is he sniffing? Yes, he appears to be sniffing the crate,” the newscaster reported. Jack hit the mute button to shut the idiot up. Anyone with eyes could tell he was sniffing the damn thing.
~ Reg looked down. Just when he thought his day couldn’t get any worse. There it was: a nice, light brown stain. Mocking him.
~ Are you going to stand arguing until my guests walk through the door, proving, once and for all, that the dinner party is indeed tonight?
~ “He is my grandson, Mickey, and if you don’t show some respect I’ll leather your arse, boy.” Mickey stared at her, his cheek glowing red.
“Nan!” Petey exclaimed, sounding deeply impressed.
~
“It was attributed to faulty wiring, but sometimes I think that’s arson investigation speak for ‘we don’t really know’.”
~
“Oooh, big talk for a man locked up and chained.”
“Temporary setbacks. I’m going to rip your head off.” Beside him, Tony made a gurgled choking sound. “With my bare hands.”
~
“Dead?” Shawn screeched, hitting a pitch that would traumatize dogs. “Are you—you’re really here to kill me?”
~ “Bullet proof vest wouldn’t have helped,” he assured her cheerfully. “His trademark is three shots to the head, point-blank.”
~ It’s high school. They have metal detectors for those people who lay too low.
~
No one expects IT to work; the successful manager merely has to ensure an invigoratingly frequent variation of the ways in which it doesn’t work. “Can I access my email again yet?” “Indeed you can. But now, if you double-click on the Excel icon, your sister will die.”
~
“We missed it by 137 feet?”
“Miles…”
~
Maybe they don’t have a 100% literacy rate and also can’t count…
~
“Can they be identified as NEA?”
“They were carrying badges.”
~
“What time is it in Tokyo? Is it thirteen hours? Fourteen hours? Ahead or behind?”
“Guys, there are clocks on the wall…”
~
“I merely made an entirely warranted request for clarification. I thought perhaps that I had woken up in a parallel reality, where instead of being a vitally important member, I was a carpenter whose assistant had nothing better to do than ask me if I have a tape-measure.” 
“In no parallel reality would you ever be a carpenter, Josh. People who understand the concept of furniture don’t hit their desks with letter openers and demand that they unstick their drawers immediately or face the consequences.” 
~ “Yes, he’s there... but he’s calling himself ‘Jessica’ now.” Donna grinned as an outraged “Don-na!” floated out of the open office door. 
“He’s having gender ambiguity problems,” she elaborated, going back to her typing. 
~
“What?” He blinked, shook his head a few times to find some more words, and settled for “What?” 
~ The woman had somehow managed to survive his childhood with dignity, class, and most of her hair. That equated to sainthood.
~
“I’ve read the speech and think you ought to be ready with some dead audience metaphors.”
~
“What does snark mean?”
“I don’t know, but he’s doing it.”
~
“He looks down his nose at me ‘cause I’m not a lawyer. I got a PhD in economics instead. And all that happened was I won a Nobel Prize and got elected President so I guess that decision didn’t really pay off. Should I run back and get my Nobel Prize?”
“I think he knows you’ve got one.”
~
I’m going to tell you a story and then I need you to tell me whether or not I’ve engaged sixteen people in a massive criminal conspiracy to defraud the public in order to win a Presidential election.
~
“How many more of these interrogations do I have to do?”
“1,138.”
“Okay, after five of them, I’m just going to confess.”
~
“Mexico collapsed over the weekend?”
“No, actually, just this morning.”
~ Well, I’m assuming that when a ship runs into the shore it has something to do with either the navigation or the steering.
~
I think this is going well so far, Oliver, it’s almost hard to believe that four women have sued you for divorce.
~
This is true. My people are forever near death.
~  Rule Two, he thought dizzyingly to himself, don’t ever make a Kryptonian under a yellow sun angry.
~
It was really quite draining, to have to read “directed, intentional, airborne magical emissions of classes 5E through 12BB” three times over before remembering that meant ‘advanced charms’.
~ Charles now had a desk. He’d never had such a luxury before, but he wasn’t quite sure he wanted one now. His current ‘desk’ was made entirely of stacks of paperwork from the end of the war. Amazing, really, how much paperwork was required to process a miracle.
~ Instead of sending polite letters noting the new change in government, the other countries had gotten very edgy and (in Percy’s opinion) completely overreacted by going to war with France.
~ He had just been pretending to be nigh on developmentally disabled to fool everyone into thinking that he, that idiot Sir Percy, could never be the Scarlet Pimpernel. It had appeared to work out very well too, until he got a bit overexcited at the thought that his wife still loved him and ended up dropping secret rings everywhere.
~ “By the way,” he interjects suddenly, tearing his lips from hers, and Rose thinks that this had bloody better well be a life-or-death type of aside. “Nice shoes.”
~ “Clearly he is a bad influence on Nightwing.  Otherwise my son would Bring Me My Pants!” 
~
“All it takes is one bad day to turn a man into a monster. Well in my case, a bad day and a chemical bath.”
~
“How come my office doesn’t have a view like that?” Bruce asked as soon as he entered the office.
“It does,” replied Lucius without turning his chair.
“Oh.” Bruce shrugged. “I guess I’ll have to go in there one of these days.”
~ “Whoa, I didn’t say anything was funny---”
“You implied it by laughing!”
~
“Yes, Mr. Popo?” The God of Earth was currently laying in a hammock drinking his Piña Colada. 
~ (The last part was never particularly clear, as it was just at this stage his helicopter landed, and the speech finished over the sound of rotor blades as the world’s greatest champion was hastily whisked away to make his two o’clock appearance.)
~
There were periods in her fifteenth year when she was actually able to forget her father saved the world, sometimes for as long as a few hours at a time. It was during this year that she set a record at five hours and twenty-four minutes spent without being once reminded about world champions of any kind; the majority of which was spent mid-way through a particularly memorable trigonometry exam.
~
What this impressive list of talents lacked, however, was even a fraction of the cunning required to convincingly maintain a secret identity.
~
“Say I believe you—which I don’t, because it’s bollocks—but say I do: what am I supposed to do with a Roman soldier?”
~
“Julius, make a mental note: kill Ms. Croft if she tries any such thing.”
~
“Yes, I ate lunch and did my homework, yes, I’m fine, and no, I haven’t burned down the apartment yet.”
“And hello to you, too,” he said, unable to help but grin at her exasperated tone.
“Is there some other reason you’re calling, or does that pretty much cover it?” Dawn asked.
“Well, I’d planned on having an actual conversation, but seeing as you’ve hit on all the major points already…”
~
“That… really wouldn’t surprise me,” he admitted reluctantly. “You know, all of this seemed very logical before I started talking to you.”
~
“Well, it’s…near the beach.” Xander sighed and added resignedly, “Which, admittedly, is filled with sea monsters.”
~ The device gave a low pitched beep, and the display panel lit up, flashing a stream of alien script. They froze, because that kind of thing was never good. In unison, they executed Torchwood Standard Procedure Number Four - get the fuck away from the glowing alien tech.
~ Five days and six hours after he left the initial message, Owen picked up the phone to a surprisingly familiar “You bastard!”
~
“You’ve reached Owen. Unless the world’s ending, leave a message. If it is, call the mobile.”
~
“Don’t look at me like that,” he huffs. “I know exactly what that grin is for — I invented that grin, I did. That’s my grin.”
“And, is it working?”
“A little bit,” he admits, sighing and grabbing a jacket. “C’mon, lets go.”
~ “Do you even know what ‘bane’ means?” Ianto wrinkled his nose. “They’ve practically named it ‘this’ll kill you’!”
~ “That is not a wedding ring!” he says brightly. “Very definitely not a wedding ring!” And he shoots a look at Rose that says I’m-so-very-brilliant and what-were-you-worried-about?
~ “But I like the olives,” he complains, in a voice he’s sure is only just this side of Not Sulking.
“You haven’t eaten any,” she points out, eyeing the pile in front of him.
“Of course I haven’t,” he says. “I like them. I’ve decided to rescue them!”
~ “We’re on Galapagos. Planet of a thousand islands. Boasts fourteen of the best beaches in three galaxies, though six of them are absolute rubbish, really. I mean, honestly, the sand is sticky! Sticky sand! Who’d want sticky sand getting in their pants?”
~ “Mind meld? Body swap? Temporal and spatial transduction of mental awareness. Yes, that sounds better.”
“You haven’t a clue, have you?”
“Not a one,” he says, poking Rose’s flat chest, “but it is not at all nice of you —not at all nice— to snatch my body while I sleep.”
~ In 2080, when Jack’s coral has been with him for about one hundred years, he finally concedes that it needs something larger to sit on. Well, OK, it telepathically implies to him that something larger to rest on would be considerably appreciated, thank you very much.
~ “We have a dinosaur,” he says calmly, like it’s nothing.
~ “He said ‘make me’; that’s all the incentive I needed,” Talbert shot back.
~
What did you think you were doing taking on Evan? You’re like the size of one of his arms!
~
“So, if anyone knows who Sarah is, please let Ferret know,” he said, gesturing towards a tall boy with the word ‘Sarah’ tattooed on his neck.
~ You remember Sam the Stalker freshman year and Creepy Craig last semester…
~
“You’re only 110; you’ve never been chased by a torch bearing mob.”
~
“If you’re not the killer, and let’s go with that cause that’s comforting, what are you doing here?”
~
But you are not the man I on occasion pretend to respect if you don’t do this properly.
~
Did I spike the punch? All these years and you still don’t trust me…Yes, I did. 
~
“Wow, I didn’t know parents still named their kids Chuck or Eugene.”
“Well, my parents were sadists… and carnival freaks found him in a dumpster and raised him as their own.”
~
“I defused a real bomb. Wait a second, what if it hadn’t worked?”
“Just don’t puke on the C-4.”
~
And that was the moment you knew you liked me? Can we make it a different moment?
~ Look, I know this is weird because we work together and up to and possibly including now, I’ve repulsed you, but I like you.
~
No Trespassing: Violators will be shot. Survivors will be shot again. 
~ The guards would dutifully read off the information that they had on her from a computerized clipboard: Rose Tyler; home planet, earth; twenty-six years of age according to earth calendar; capable of child-bearing; fit for labour; high intelligence. And, then, at the end of their litany about her was Rose’s favourite part: potential threat of escape or insurgency, high.
~
She’d smiled breezily and insulted their honor and their masculinity at the top of her voice and in the most common dialect she could muster (all in the hearing of several of their similarly-seeking-intergalactic-domination peers, she was happy to see).
~
Oh, and if you could say ‘Hi’ to Bruce for me without making me sound drippy, go for it.
~
He’d tried to get Nancy to take Jamie and get off the blasted train but instead she just looked at him like he was stupid and then she ignored him. Edmund was no help; he’d just said something about mothers outranking kings.
~ “I wouldn’t tell too many people,” said Ron. “Educational Decree Number twenty-whatever-it’s-up-to-now will be that you aren’t allowed to own anything that might cheer you up.”
~
“Charles, am I the only sane person here? And considering it’s me asking the question that’s a frightening prospect.”
~ “Baby meerkats,” Brittany said cheerfully.
“Of course!” Logan groaned. “What else would they be? Nothing sane!”
~ “Are you a clone?” she demanded.
Thrown by the sudden question, Clark paused and asked in bewilderment, “What?”
~ From the kitchen, they heard Jason ask, “Grandma, do you know why they named it Kansas?”
Lois groaned, but to everyone’s surprise Martha answered the question easily. “There used to be a tribe of Indians called the Konza living here, Jason. When Europeans settled here, they called them the Kansa, and this was Kansa’s territory, which is how we got the name.”
Clark’s jaw dropped, and Lois whispered, “Hallelujah! He’s been asking that since before we left. Clark, your mother is amazing.”
~ A Dr. Gregory Harper (the grandfather of one Owen Harper) had been most intrusive when it came to examining all the people the nano-genes had healed. The old lady whose leg grew back had slapped him for getting fresh.
~
“Didn’t say. Usually he just grunts. I am surprised he said that much,” Thomas answered.
~
“No, she’d just fire the accountant. Out of a cannon. Into a volcano.”
“She should write a book: ‘Everything I Needed to Know about Management, I Learned from James Bond Movies.”
~
No, please explain it. If you don’t, curiosity will get the better of me and I’ll Google it. The last time I did that, I spent an hour vomiting and couldn’t look at horses for months afterwards. 
~
“I can’t believe you actually touched it. Are you ok?”
“If I can get my hand soaking in a pitcher of antiseptic in the next thirty seconds, yes. Otherwise, I’m going to need a meat cleaver and your help cauterising the stump.”
“Let’s go with the pitcher. I’m no good with cauterising.”
~ I’m calling my lawyer to see if it’s legal to purchase and demolish a shopping mall out of spite.

There was a moment of incredulous silence. “Severus…where in nine galaxies did you get a legal Portkey?” Lupin said weakly.
“From an authorized Portkey creator,” Snape said dryly. “Minerva McGonagall.”
~ “You are not going out in the middle of a flesh-eating storm.”
“But there’s nothing to do inside!”
~
I’ve never heard of Shadow Elves, and to be honest it sounds like a ridiculous idea from an unimaginative fantasy world. Though, I would like it to be known, Miss Lovegood, that I think your dress is absolutely gorgeous and hope you have a lovely day.” (Editor’s Note: Miss Lovegood’s dress is truly spectacular and we find ourselves agreeing heartily with the Minister. First time for everything, it seems.)
~ She would have ripped him to shreds if Frodo hadn’t learned to fly in the last second
~ “Quite,” said Gandalf, and he lifted his staff and pointed it at the bird. “Reveal yourself!” he demanded, a great power in his voice. The owl pierced him with a glare. Gandalf mumbled something and poked at the bird with his staff. It screeched at him, and, to the astonishment of the Company, turned its back in a deliberate and obvious dismissal of the wizard.
~ Harry shot up at this. An arrow, an axe and two swords immediately followed his ascent.
~ Harry, though, was completely confused. He, as Harry Potter, had never been thrown over in favour of his owl. He rather enjoyed his unimportance in this universe.
~ The troll even made the same stupid expression as the one in the girl’s bathroom had when it found itself without a club. It even looked up at the floating iron mallet above its head in a kind of dumb wonderment, as though thinking that clubs didn’t usually fly, especially ones only a troll could lift.
~ And the strange thing was, that they weren’t even sparring with swords, they were fighting, instead, with a big cow horn and a silver crown. They even seemed to have made some sort of contest out of it. The theme of which appeared to be Who Chuck’s Their Opponent’s Weapon the Furthest Wins.
~ A sudden attack of the cough seemed to be the main cover up for the hobbits and Boromir. Gimli, however, appeared to be going for a less subtle approach in the form of outright laughing behind the blade of his axe. It obscured his face, if not the sound.
~ He glared at Harry a full ten seconds before exploding with a bashing of elvish that made Legolas’s eyebrows shoot up and Aragorn’s mouth to drop open. He obviously hadn’t said anything wholesome.
~ He didn’t have time to feel relief, however, because something strange happened. “Good afternoon Mr Potter. I’d wondered when you’d finally put me on your head. It’s been terribly uncomfortable swinging from your hip like that.” His hat was talking.
~
“Do we trust you now? These are black times, and an unknown entity that deems fit to abstain knowledge from the rulers of this land is not to be trusted.” Harry bit back the first retort that settled on his tongue, which went something along the lines of a sarcastic “Hahahaha!” because the king seemed to have grown even more demanding in that moment.
~ They looked at him as though they had only just realised he was a wizard.
~ Fleur waved a delicately boned hand. “Pish,” she said, sounding remarkably English.
“Yeah, ‘Pish’ Hermione,” Ron sniggered. Hermione pursed her lips. Ginny crossed her arms. Harry drank his milk.
~
The gnome flew the length of sixty feet before landing in the next field. Hermione shook her hands and did a sort of jig on the spot. “Did you see that?” she squealed, her face beaming. “Did you see what I did?” Harry and Ron only stared at her, too dumbfounded to speak. “I gave that gnome what for!” she continued, this time emphasising her words by a fisted hand jerking in the direction of the fallen victim, who now drunkenly climbed to its feet. The tiny figure then dived (just as drunkenly) into a nearby rabbit hole — but not before popping out for a quick one-fingered salute then dashing back in.
~ This so startled the normally stoic ranger (it was not a usual occurrence to have flames appear in front of one’s face out of mid-air after all) that this time he did fall off his horse. Ears that had been honed in the depths of silent forests throughout his travels in Middle Earth, and which, consequently, could hear better than those of his mortal brethren, caught the sound of an old surprised voice saying, “Merlin’s Beard,” very conversationally. As though all this were a usual occurrence. Though he knew not the meaning of the words Aragorn still almost snorted. Only a wizard would behave so.
~
“Stroll?” Haldir repeated disbelievingly. “This will be a battle. You do not take a… a stroll into battle!”
~ They were heaving their weapons around manically (and sometimes, Harry noticed, stupidly hewing the uruk next to them in their anger).
~ A young boy by the name of Eorling (who, like Gimli, had to stand on a box in order to see over the wall) kept on tugging at Harry’s sleeve excitedly and requesting that he “Make them fly, please Harry,” only to get scolded by his father for “addressing a wizard so informally.”
~ “Shall I put up the call, or shall you?” Boromir asked in a tone that suggested he’d seen all the wonders he ever could, and would, and so was not entitled to be shocked or surprised by anything Harry did anymore.
~
“A boy? But no mere boy could destroy an entire army! What are you!”
“A wizard,” Harry answered pleasantly. “Arrived a couple of months back. Weather’s been nice.”
~ So, in a moment of frustrated pique, he had abandoned his dimension-hopping attempts and gone to the World Martial Arts Tournament.
~ Harry had never been “hmmed” at before, and found it slightly disconcerting, especially as he was trying to be inconspicuous.
~ He had awoken in the nearest hospital, thinking he’d get arrested for his lack of existence with the government, and prepared to place some very heavy memory charms — only to find out that this dimension was lax about such mundane things like existence and that aliens occasionally attempted to take over the Earth.
~ He had just tripped over an uplifted bit concrete in the city’s centre, only to find that he’d turned all the people in the nearest three cars into a pre-historic fish of unidentifiable origin.
~ “It won’t be like sitting in your cushy office in the Pentagon,” Hawkeye commented as he walked by.
“Gee, I hope not,” replied Hogan. “I’d hate to have my haemorrhoids flare up again.”
~
“When I was a Colonel, I had no use for Generals. Now that I am one, I have even less use for them.”
~ Batman nods grimly. “We’ll see,” he says, but the tone of his voice says, “yes.”
~ They were looking at him with such guilelessness, such helpful innocence, that he knew, without the slightest bit of uncertainty, that they’d had a hand in the disaster.
~
“Good,” she says, and takes another sip. “Because I have a gun.”
“Well, I have a hockey stick,” he informs her.
~ Lucius has a customary greeting (“What is it today, Mr. Wayne?”), and Bruce has become quite fond of coming up with more and more ridiculous things to respond with (“Do you have anything that could extinguish the sun, just for a moment? I’m not talking about anything major, here. A few seconds should be fine.”).
~ By-lines, awards, interviews, mentions, plaques in Perry’s office, certificates in frames along the bullpen walls, and even an old post-it note tacked on the break room cork board saying that he would be happy to buy the entire office lunch if someone would just stop eating his Chinese left-overs out of the fridge.
~ Lois sat back down at her desk, glaring in Clark’s direction and hitting the keys harder than necessary. The bullpen assumed the normal “that’s didn’t just happen” position, Jimmy went back to not eavesdropping, and Clark adjusted the glasses on his nose in his shy, normal way. Perry bellowed for the meeting, it was 10:15.
~
Perry sat at the head of the table with mismatched suspenders; to Clark’s knowledge no one his entire life had ever had the courage to suggest he was color-blind.
~
“Lois. Why are we drunk at a baseball game on a Tuesday?”
“You’re drunk. I am not drunk. You’re a lightweight, Smallville.”
~
“Remember the stack of photographs I politely asked you to never let see the light of day again? Could you find those for me maybe? And not mention it to Richard on pain of death? because I will kill you.” Jimmy knew exactly where those photographs were (kind of), having championed a level of organization in his various portfolios unknown in modern times, which consisted of a few hundred different parameters for filing from “Date” and “Subject” to “Six or More People” and “I Was Happy When I Took These.”
~ “Do you have a car?” Jimmy looked up as if to say, ‘Look who you just asked!’ “Okay, never mind, we’ll take mine.”
~
“Small motor scooters are an efficient and low priced city transportation alternative,” horns blared to their left, panicked people were cursing and warning them away in their wake, “I, as a licensed operator, am fully qualified to operate this machine in this state and beyond,” Jimmy’s camera bag almost leapt out of the little basket on the front when he hopped a curb, “And the press pass on the front helps me avoid parking tickets.”
~
“Did you know there was a bullpen pool going for almost nine years on how you’d get yourself killed?” Richard made a gesture at the briefcase that he felt would express the horrendousness of this action, hoping it would speak of the concern and attention that Lois obviously needed to have for her own life. As he looked at her however, he saw she was trying not to smile. Richard stared at her, furious again in the light of this disregard. “You did know?”
“I, uh, took odds on ‘death by natural fire.’ I think I get five hundred dollars if I die in a volcano.”
~
“There should be a button on my desk I can press and forty-nine people instantly pray for me.”
~
“Ah, that tastes like... nothing at all. It has no tastes or properties of any kind.”
~
While Richard stalled in his pursuit at this scene (which puts the words “hostage situation” into perspective for someone who fifteen minutes ago was eating a Danish uptown), Jimmy was the one who made his way bravely forward between the trucks and towards the line of police cars with men taking cover behind doors, weapons raised.
~ “Did he owe you a bottle of gin, too?” Jim’s voice was full of laughter. Weren’t they in a life and death situation about sixty seconds ago?
~ “Hold still, this is what you get for deciding you needed to go to your bank at that second!”
“But I was going to overdraft my account, that’s a fifty dollar fee!” Clark was dancing out of her reach.
Lois was trying to grab his coat with her stained hands, “Come back here, you clean bastard.”
~ “Do I really look like this?” he held up the one sided invitation and pointed enthusiastically to the little, cartoon Superman holding a blue balloon with his red and yellow shield on it. It was grinning and waving, but with a very serious expression on its face like the artist was trying to convey the strength of character of an international hero but with the sense of fun that comes with a birthday card. Five seconds later Lois was laughing hysterically, and pointing at him.
“Make the face!”
“No! Who makes these?” he flipped over the card fruitlessly, “I knew I should have copyrighted myself, I’d own an island by now...”
~
Lois was apologetic looking, but not the kind of look that says, ‘I am sorry to disappoint you, I have failed, I am your servant!’, but the patented, ‘Um, sorry I acted in a way that was unexpected and somehow inconvenient for you, but get over it?’
~ Jimmy pouted at her, “I’ll have you know I have a full and manly beard!”
~ Clark did not understand the fury that rose in him at first, and was confused to find himself suddenly itching to not only throw a desk at Richard, but point out to Lois everything negative about the man, including about a thousand points that he was sure he was inventing.
~ Normally the epitome of calm in the worst of scenarios, like, the end of the world, Clark was now experiencing what he assumed was ‘freaking out.’
~ Lois was resting her chin sideways against the high shine of the conference room table, feeling around by feet for the pen she let roll off the table at almost every brief that she was able to sit at for the last nine years. Clark, as usual, handed her the second pen he always carried for her like a torch of never-ending love and devotion.
~ “Wow. You look like shit, Smallville.” Clark sighed and let his initial, “Welcoming you into my home with enthusiasm and good cheer!” posture sag off his shoulders as he moved back from the door for Lois.
~
“Comfy there, drunky?” She had been calling him that at least once a day for three days, which was insignificant in itself, but which indicated an unspoken promise to call him that every day forever.
~ The news anchor was reviewing the project’s prior accomplishments, including the first ever space walk that featured astronauts debating the feasibility of having Superman bring them pizza.
~ “Do you realize it’s Tuesday?” You had to interrupt Lois when she was drunk if you could even entertain making a point.
~
“Shush Janet, you’re too drunk to live,” came Maurice, trying to play Tetris on his computer and really far too intoxicated to keep up with the keys as his stack of blocks approached the top of the screen.
~ She was there to meet with a bunch of generals who insisted she meet them to prove how important they were.
~ “Colonel Carter, are you threatening your Commanding Officer?” he asked, sounding scandalized.
“I would never do that, sir. And I would also never, say, dismantle the engine of your truck just before your next fishing trip, leaving you stuck here during your vacation. Or anything like that. Sir.”
~ “You, you think we’ve travelled back in time!” He’d always known television would have a nasty affect on Dudley.
Dudley sensed he had sounded stupid. “I don’t!”
~
“Believe in magic,” James asked incredulously. “Of course we believe in magic. We’re four hundred year old cursed, undead pirates.” 
~ “I cannot see,” he told his companion, who was sitting behind him.
“Er, I don’t want to state the obvious, but you might try opening your eyes, then.”
~ He knew it was a wand, well, ‘cause it looked like one, what with the pointing and the waving and the magic coming out one end…
~
“I know, it’s just . . . what am I doing here?”
Those eyes crinkled. “I imagine, my dear, though forgive me if I am wrong, that you appear to be sitting.”
~ “Pay attention! If I told you to find me a bezoar where would you look?”
“On the third shelf of that cabinet over there.”
~ A great rush of wind heralded the arrival of the trains, and when their train stopped, the door opened and courteously advised them to mind the gap. Neville politely answered, “Thank you,” only to have Harry poke him in the ribs.
~ With Harry explaining things, Neville retreated to his preferred task of nodding earnestly at everything Harry said. He was much better in a supporting role.
~ All these years you’ve had it, and you never broke it out of clumsiness, did you? Though heaven knows you’re all butterfingers with my china. No, if you’re going to break your wand, it ought to be while fighting bloody Death Eaters. That’s a proper way to break your wand. Frankie would be proud of it. Right proud, indeed.
~
“Certainly. But when we’re back home, under more - controlled conditions. Not out here. You could set someone on fire.”
~
“Be that as it may,” said Dr. Driftwood, “we don’t need any more consultants. This rag-tag fellow,” he gestured at Remus. “He looks like a gypsy. What’s he supposed to be an expert in - palm-reading?”
“No,” Remus said quietly, his eyes narrowing. “Defense against the Dark Arts.” Driftwood’s eyes bulged once more, and he grew pale. Neville couldn’t be sure, but he almost thought he saw Snape give Driftwood a nasty smirk.
~
“Would someone please transfigure a chair for Professor Snape?”
“We’ll do it!” the twins sang out, rolling up their sleeves and brandishing their wands in unison.
“You most certainly will not!” called out McGonagall, shrewdly heading off whatever disaster the twins had planned.
~ “Think you can stand?” Neville pondered the issue, but since he couldn’t seem to locate his legs, it seemed unlikely.
~
“Ack! And no more of that, young man. I retired to get away from all that crap. It’s just Tom now. You can say ‘Tom,’ can’t you?”
Jon grinned and replied, “Yes, Sir!”
“Impertinent whelp! Ah, the youth of today have no respect for their elders,” the general lamented to no one in particular.
~
Then he had heard the cool, calm words that froze the blood in his veins. ‘Am I a primary target or a target of opportunity’ the kid had asked. The kid took it for granted that someone was trying to kill him and had treated it like an everyday occurrence. Watching the kid inspect and holster that pistol with practiced, smooth movements nearly stopped his heart.
~ Despite Harry’s best attempt at flattery, Lockhart looked like he had been slapped as Harry interrupted his speech, which if Harry’s suspicions were correct, he had rehearsed many times in front of a mirror.
~
He was suddenly of the opinion that wearing cloaks should be outlawed so he could see who he was fighting.
~ Bruce groaned and buried his face in his hands. “You look like the living dead.”
“That’s good,” Richard said calmly, accepting his plate of eggs. “Vampires are very hot right now.”
“I’ve created a monster,” Bruce mumbled.
“Permit me to point out, sir, that Frankenstein’s creation was not a vampire,” Alfred volunteered in his most helpful tones.
Bruce dropped his hands in order to glare. “Why are you always on his side?”
“I’m not on anybody’s side, sir, I was merely putting in a word for literary accuracy.”
~
“I stole it from Lex’s jet.”
Bruce burst into laughter. “What happens to Lex if his jet goes down in the Atlantic next trip?”
“I’ll spend the rest of my life saying, ‘Out damned spot!’”
~ “I am,” agreed Batman implacably. “It would behoove you well to remember that I am nearly always right.”
~ “You do realise you’re giggling, don’t you?” Moony’s voice said, cutting of his hilarity abruptly.
“I was not!” he objected indignantly, “I was- chuckling. And in a very manly fashion! And stop laughing at me Harry.”
“Of course,” the werewolf agreed with an annoyingly condescending expression, “And was there a reason for your gigg- I’m sorry, ‘manly chuckling’?”
“I don’t know if I want to tell you now,” he sniffed haughtily.
~ “They voluntarily went flying in the middle of winter?” he said incredulously before hesitating as he realised it sounded like something he would do also, “Well- I suppose that’s not too bad a thing.”
~ She’s way too good for him. She’s way too good for this store. Is there another place where beautiful people can shop?
~ “Y’know, most people don’t say the word ‘gasp.’ They just gasp.”
~ You love secrets. You wanna marry secrets and have little half-secret, half-human babies.
~
“Musing on the idea of setting someone on fire doesn’t mean you really want to set them on fire, it’s just the thought of it that makes you happy, but only for a second, then you feel bad, but that second can be a lot of fun. I’m not thinking of setting someone on fire. I was just speaking in the figurative, but firguratively speaking, someone should set you on fire for throwing my heart into the mess when you told me that he didn’t want me. That wasn’t the truth bus. That was the bitchy, cross town express.” 
~
“Future me is going ‘I told you so’ up one side of you and down the other, but Now me is just going to sit  back and watch.”
“That was a mean thing you just did.”
“Really? ‘Cause Future me is here now and I’ve got something to say.”
~
“Might I make an observation? Neutral thought I would say is neither complimentary or critical.”
~ Lewis Shatz is a big fat liar and I say fat in reference to his size as a liar not as a judgement of his physical appearance.
~
“Exactly what makes you think that the civilized world is on the verge of a major economic disaster?”
“It’s hypothetical!” Mr. Satan lied and forced a laugh. “Pure imagination...” He let the sentence trail off.
~
“Oh. I know what to do. Here, look. How many fingers am I holding up?”
“Six.” Gohan muttered, arms wrapped around his head.
Pan huffed, impatient. “No! You have to open your eyes and look! Otherwise it doesn’t work!”
“Two.” He corrected. Then he opened both eyes and frowned up at his daughter. “Don’t make that gesture.”
“Why not? The big kids at school…”
~
Dragons aged at their own pace. Nobody on Earth was certain of what the average dragon lifespan was because nobody on Earth had ever outlived a dragon.
~ “Don’t eat what you can’t identify.” Bob managed a weak smile. “Village proverb.”
~
“Boy.” Uranai Baba scolded, the disrespect in her voice reminding him that she could, on a whim, turn him into small furry animal of some sort. Or worse. Because she didn’t like it when people disrupted her business or forgot to respect their elders or even - and this was the worst - questioned her psychic abilities. All of which Goku had, inadvertently, just done. “What I know and what I choose to tell you are two different things.”
~ “When you’re closing on four hundred years old, you’re automatically a history expert.” Oolong smiled. “Which gives you the right to raise hell if the museums don’t present things accurately.”
~ “You misplaced Vegeta in the afterlife?” His voice was a blend of wonder and disbelief. “Should I even ask?”
~
“I have proof that Laird is my real father. We are both athletic, we have great heads of hair, we—”
“He’s eight years older than you.”
“Your proof is better. I retract my statement. Sorry, real father.”
~ I’m sure he’s got an excuse for being late…an excuse with really long legs.
~ “Mum!” Hermione said in a stage whisper, “that man has a tentacle for a hand!”
“Sh,” said Dr. Marilyn Granger, “it’s not polite to stare, dear.” Being calm in a crisis was something she had always been good at, and she saw no reason to stop now.
~ That might have made some girls jealous, but Susan had better things to do with her time. “Spaghetti?”
~
“All I know is that he shouldn’t be dead. The only reason he’s dead is because he isn’t alive. I still have to examine the brain.”
~ I’ve done a lot of travelling in Spanish speaking countries and I can get by with ‘a cup of coffee, please’ and ‘my name is Harry’ and ‘do you mind if I exorcise that demon living in your attic?’.
~ “They’re both in a coma and we have no idea why. When translating, can you phrase that to seem less hopeless?”
~
Harry liked to think of himself as a pretty intelligent, observant man. After all, he made a living as a private investigator and he was a wizard. He should have been able to notice subtle clues and details, whether in an old book or trying to find a missing person. Apparently he needed a refresher course because somewhere along the lines tonight he missed something very important because right now Murphy, Lieutenant Connie Murphy, was kissing him.
~ “Give me back my stick, so I can beat you with it.”
“That’s not a very persuasive argument.”
~ “Your face is all ‘rrarr’,” Dresden informs me. He shoots off a surprisingly well-aimed blast and knocks a crazed looking girl back through the door. “S’probably why they’re trying to kill us.”
~ “The altar’s down,” Morgan says, coming up behind us. “Vandervall is in custody. The building is burning.”
“That’s not my fault,” Dresden declares, quickly.
~ “And the ghost…tolerates that?”
“Bob does, yeah,” said Harry, stressing the name. “Why wouldn’t he?” Morgan didn’t know exactly where to begin explaining how incongruous it was that a spirit who in his life had terrorized entire villages and whose crimes earned him a curse that still made grown wizards inwardly wince should be given such a friendly-sounding moniker.
~ He was in the process of listening to Dresden’s explanation as to why he had nothing to do with the Sieve demon that had been on the loose in the city. Off to the right, the ghost interjected with the logic that if Harry were smart enough to conjure a Sieve demon, he wouldn’t be so stupid as to stick around and let it beat him nearly senseless, which is what it basically had done.
~ “It’s just this birthday thing,” Harry answered with a frown. “You know Uncle Justin’s throwing me that huge party.”
“Yes, how vile,” the ghost commented, drolly.
~ “It was an accident.  I’m sure your uncle will understand.”
Harry gave him an incredulous glance. “Um, Bob? Have you met Uncle Justin?”
~
Kirmani hadn’t been about to heed the words of a 40-year old man who still used the terms “dude” and “chill” in his everyday lexicon.
~ His companion was currently in the middle of defending himself against a tall man wielding a hockey stick with a startling amount of determined fury. The choice of weaponry had me lifting an incredulous eyebrow until I saw a bolt of blue light streak out of its end, catching Client #2 square in the chest, blasting him across the room.
~ “Are you a friend of Harry’s?” she asked.
“No,” came the firm answer, proving just how much disdain could be coated on one word. 
~
“For god’s sake, Morgan! Did you use him as a battering ram?” 
“Yes, that’s exactly what I did. I used the only other person capable of magic within a four mile radius to knock down doors. Because that would be the smart thing to do when facing off with a Bezoar and her undead army.”
~ “And what exactly were you doing when he was getting smashed into walls?” asked the ghost, ignoring Harry.
Taking a nap. Reading a book. Tuning a guitar.  “I was fighting off the other 50 possessed bodies coming at us,” he said instead, talking over her indistinct description of a blonde who would have been pretty cute if she hadn’t been a corpse….and trying to chew his face off.
~
“It’s part of the spell, I think.” She twitched a little next to me. “Would it help if I used a substitute word for spell? How about kitten? Kittens aren’t scary. ‘It’s part of the kitten’.”
~ “Uh, not to be blunt or anything,” I started, before he could speak. “But you do realize you’re dead, right?”
“Yeah, I figured that out,” he agreed.
“Sometimes people are in denial,” I explained.
“No, I’m pretty sure I’m dead,” he said.
~ “A spell?” he repeated, sceptically. “No way, man.”
“Jake, you’re a ghost talking to a wizard,” I pointed out. “Are you really going to doubt me on this?”
~ “Once, I’d like weirdness to be related to something good. Like ‘oh, we were trapping people in their nightmares so we can find a cure for cancer’. No one is ever nefarious for the greater good.”
~ “But, it requires a good deal of concentration and finesse with delicate spells,” he explained. “As you know, your forte is not with delicacy.”
“No,” I agreed. “Harry like things go boom.”
~ “Connie’s sick,” he said.
To which I sensibly replied, “Fuck!”
~ We made our way down the hall. The little cloth booties I had to put over my sneakers were very slippery on the well-scrubbed floor. I gave up trying to look dignified and settled on trying to look sober. Kirmani swaggered. I resisted the urge to trip him.
~ “You should go to school. School is important.”
“Mom’s importanter,” she retorted.
I couldn’t argue with that. “Yeah. She is.” I made up my mind to get Murphy out of there. You know, if only to save Anna’s education.
~
“I believe I know a way you could help Lt. Murphy,” he said, with a sigh. “But it’s dangerous and it’s foolish and it will probably be considered breaking at least one of the Seven Laws.”
“Do I have to kill anyone?” I asked.
“No.”
“Well then, tell me what to do.”
~
“Time frame?”
“As soon as possible,” I said.
“Life or death?”
“Uh, life, preferably.”
~ She stomped hard on his foot and then burst into a wailing hissy fit of tears. Her step-mom came running from the waiting room. Nurses came running from the station. Isolation guy hopped in a circle on one foot. I watched the scene unfold with admiration. Anna raised her head briefly from her step-mom’s chest to give me a ‘move it!’ look and I hightailed it through the sheeting, down the hall and into Murphy’s room. No one noticed. I made a mental note to buy Anna a pony.
~ “‘Only the crystal-clear question yields a transparent answer’,” I quoted, in my best Zen voice.
“Are. You. Crazy?” He pronounced, clearly.
~ “Look, he’s clearly the evil one. If we were in a movie, he’d be twirling his moustache and cackling. Besides, I couldn’t afford that coat.”
~ “Snap out of it!” I yelled back. “You are a trained member of the Chicago Police Department and you are cowering like a girl. Get your ass over here and shoot me or I swear to God I will let every cop in this city know what a pansy you’re being!”
“I’m sorry, cowering like a what?” she asked, stepping up beside me. She had her gun up and pointing at Other Me.
I beamed at her. “Like a wimpy little girl in pig-tails, Murph.”
“I’m going to shoot you next,” she warned.
“Just take him out first.”
~
“I told you not to go anywhere,” I scolded her, lightly.
“I’m being tested,” Murphy replied. I fell into step with the procession “Apparently I’m a medical anomaly.”
“Nifty,” I told her. “Can you put that on a résumé?”
~ “Oh fine!” she exclaimed, throwing her hands up. “I’ll go learn stuff! But if anything happens and I’m not here, I’m totally blaming you.”
~
“Sure, ask away,” I said, amiably. “No guarantees I can answer them all, though.”
“Fair enough. Did you wake the lieutenant up?”
“Yes.”
“Did you put the salt on the floor of her room?”
“Yes.”
“Are those two things related?”
“Sort of.”
“Did you use any scientific or medical means to wake her up?”
“No.”
“So, there’s no chance for me to repeat the procedure on the other patients?”
“Not really.”
~ “It’s just pizza,” she said, bewildered, but smiling. He laughed and kissed her again. I decided she was his wife. Either that or his wife should be very pissed off.
~ She skipped around with toddler energy and stumbled in front of me, grabbing onto my pant leg to keep herself upright. She looked up at me. “Hi,” I said. She burst into tears. I am awesome with kids. 
~ I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes, stretching my legs out in front of me and generally making a fire hazard of myself.
~
“Don’t do any else stupid. You’ve filled your stupid quotient for the day.”
“Can I borrow some stupid from tomorrow?” I asked.
“Depends on how much you want me to punch you,” he replied.
~ I ate my pizza. That, combined with Anna’s hug, and residual joy from having succeeded got my inner workings going again. You have to run on something. I run on happy children and rescued damsels. And pepperoni.
~ “He called me a paparazzi!” She exclaimed.
“Bastard,” I said, fervently.
“I know.” She sighed. “I called that Joya lady. You owe her a lot of money.”
I winced. “Yeah. I forgot about that.”
“She didn’t. I paid for you.”
“I’ll pay you back,” I promised.
“You better. I may have to retire a year later than planned because of this. Either that or my children won’t have shoes.”
“Well, while you’re waiting fir that info...” I said. “I have another favour to ask.”
“Of course you do,” she said, with a smile in her voice. “Will it cost me anything?”
“Don’t know. If it does, I promise to always pay for your children’s shoes.”
~ “I need you to find a hair salon near the 27th District,” I began. “Called either Sapphire or Surefire Salon, or some variant there of, and find out if certain people have been there in the last few weeks.”
“Ah, now that’s more my style,” she declared. “Undercover work.”
“Can you do it without them getting suspicious?” I asked.
“Of course.”
“Oh, and don’t let them cut your hair.”
“You want me to snoop around a hair salon without getting my hair cut?” she repeated. “You’re lucky I’m so talented.”
“And beautiful and charming and kind and smart,” I filled in.
“Shut up and gimme the names.”
~ To her, he looked like an ordinary man, getting some shut eye. But he had missed the show Simms had put on earlier that had involved copious screaming and the breaking of a lot of hospital equipment as well as a few staff noses before the doctors staff had sedated him.
~ Murphy led him away as a male nurse, who looked like he probably doubled as a bouncer on his off nights, passed by them to enter Simms’ room to check his vitals. Apparently, the staff wasn’t about to send in anyone who couldn’t lay out Simms in a single punch if necessary.
~ “Simms wouldn’t tell him why he tried to kill his wife, but according to the doctor, he kept repeating that demons were haunting him.”
“Well, technically ghosts haunt,” Harry corrected. “Demons just….lurk.”
~ “And he’s claiming the devil made him do it?”
“No, no just demons,” said Harry. “And he didn’t say they made him do it. He just…you know…mentioned them.”
~ “My second husband was a psychic,” Charlotte mentioned. “I’ve often thought I should have stayed with him,” she added, wistfully.
Backing out the door, Harry gave her a charming grin. “That wouldn’t have been fair to the rest of us.”
Charlotte smiled brilliantly in return. “Oh, Mr. Dresden. The person who ends up with you is so very lucky.”
~
“We were momentarily detained by your double,” replied Morgan.
“How’d you figure out it wasn’t me?”
“There were a few indicators…the most telling being that you dissolved when I ran you through,” he said, his sword in hand.
~ He eyed the two silent wardens. “Uh…cocoa?” They stared back at him. “Thought not. Coffee?” It was a little unnerving that they didn’t even blink. “Want to stand by the door and look menacing?”
~ “You’re kidding, right? After tonight nothing can freak me out. Your friend can be a ghost for all I care.”
“Funny you should say that…”
~ “But you’re going to be sticking your hand into Ethan’s chest?” Roland reiterated, addressing Bob this time. There was still a look of protective distrust on the man’s face. Something that endeared him to the ghost, rather than offend.
~
“We have presents,” Ethan added, gripping a square package in his hand.
“You didn’t have to do that.”
“Dad got you an envelope,” Ethan stated, his voice clearly giving away his opinion of the gift. “I got you a book,” he said, proudly.
~ Watching him leave, Bob wondered if there was a way to age Harry ten years in one day so that tomorrow he’d be well past this stage.
~ “And it wasn’t overpriced. You haven’t bought things since they bartered with livestock. There’s been inflation since then.”
~ “It was worth a good deal of money,” he lamented. “If you didn’t want it, I don’t see why you couldn’t have sold it and paid the rent. Besides, didn’t you have to kill someone to get it?”
“Not someone,” I corrected. “A goat. It was possessed. I had to exorcise it. They gave me the necklace as payment. It was in Bulgaria. Things are weird there.”
~
“Strictly speaking, I’ve just conquered your country without the paperwork.”
~ “Hey, they still work,” I defended myself, gesturing with the tangled mixture of protective amulets. 
“Yes, if you’re attacked here you can throw that at them,” Bob drawled. “Minions of Hell will flee in fear from your great ball of jewelry.”
~ I took a seat and rested my aching back. The next time I take a bullet for someone, I’m putting my leg in the way instead.
~
“You could be a little more cheery. I don’t need a ghost of Christmas doom, I am fully in the ‘God Bless us Everyone’ spirit.”
“Only because you are stoned on analgesics and the fact that the policewoman kissed you,” he argued. “Before she and her daughter arrived you were merely stoned and pessimistic.”
“She also gave me a present,” I said, happily.
~ “Am not,” I immediately argued. “Wait...you can see me...not blushing?”
~
“Squeeze my hand.” I also pushed my foot against her palm, pulled my foot against her grip and informed her of my birthday, address, the names of my parents and counted backwards from 20. I missed the number 13, but otherwise I passed all tests with flying colours. 
~ I resisted the urge to put my head on her shoulder and go to sleep. “You smell nice. Sorry, that’s the concussion talking.”
~ “You said to get the wizard!” 
“I meant the dead one!”
“You never specified.”
“Oh for hell’s sake, Aziraphale! Wasn’t it obvious I meant the dead one?”
~ “Right, sorry about the mix up. Why don’t you go back to sleep?” he suggested.
“And when you wake up, you’ll be remarkably refreshed and feel very happy and optimistic about where life will lead you,” Aziraphale added pleasantly, budging in to Harry’s eyesight. Harry heard more than saw Crowley snapping his fingers. Suddenly, it felt like an invisible rope tied to his waist was yanking at him, unceremoniously dragging him down a very long, very dark hole in the ground. In the distance, he could hear Aziraphale’s disapproving voice murmur out, “Really, my dear. You could be a bit more gentle.”
~ “I vote we go in, stun the wizard, grab the skull and scupper off. How’s that?”
Aziraphale frowned. “It’s a little…” he waved his hand, gesturing to find the right word.
“Effective? Concise? Brilliant?” Crowley offered.
“Inelegant,” Aziraphale decided.
“You have a better idea?”
“I think we should go and assess the situation first.”
“Assessing situations is what got us in this mess in the first place.”
~ “We agreed we were going to assess the situation.”
“I’ve assessed. I’ve assessed the skull is here. I’ve assessed we can take it. Assessment over. Let’s go.”
“We’re not going to steal from him,” the angel stated firmly, yanking the skull away from the demon.
“Are you kidding me with this?” hissed Crowley, snatching it back. “You’re honestly going to play Keep Away?”
~
“Raving bunch of nasty little….raving nasty persons.”
~ “He killed people. He was a fully paid up member of the occult. He messed around with raising the dead,” the demon listed. “Oh, yes, have I mentioned he killed people? His soul’s obviously ours.”
Aziraphale remained looked stubborn. “The scales have changed in the last several centuries. There have been good deeds done that should be accounted for. This doesn’t taste the same without ketchup,” he added, gesturing to his food.
~ “I need alcohol for this. Stop talking until we start drinking. Let’s find a pub.”
“Do they have pubs here?” asked Aziraphale, gathering his coat.
“Yeah, they’re called bars.”
“Is drinking wise? Isn’t that how we ended up getting involved in the first place?”
“Yeah. Makes for a nice circle, don’t you think?”
~ It took a train and then a taxi ride with a driver who did his best not to stare too much at Harry when the wizard gave him directions while staring intently at a crystal dangling from a leather cord.
~ “I used a transportation spell,” said Bob, surprised that Harry hadn’t already figured that out. “Did you actually take a plane here?”
“What else would I use?” snapped Harry. “I don’t know a transportation spell strong enough. I mess up and I’m in the ocean.”
“I showed you the formula last month,” The necromancer sighed. “Weren’t you paying any attention to what I was saying?”
~ “You beat him with a display of grace and artistry I was privileged to witness. Also, he’s obnoxious.”
~
“I’ll have all three of you know I’ve definitely saved the universe at least five separate times and that doesn’t even count the time with you, Martha, because that was you and Jack, mostly, though of course my brilliance in thinking up the whole scheme to begin with can’t be discounted...” He trailed off, then shook his head, ran his hand through his hair again and was off. “Saved the world several million times, saved all three of your lives, brought you back from the dead, Grace, reversed time at least twice and! I was in the process of saving yet another planet and the three of you just don’t have any idea how terribly impressive I am.”
~ “If they attack you, do you intend on throwing that entire box of potions at them at once?” asked Bob, practically.
~ The white haired, portly grandmother type had come to the wizard as a last resort after several exterminators had informed her that whatever scratching she was hearing coming from her walls, it wasn’t a rat. Mrs. Finley had figured that much out herself after six of her dryers had exploded simultaneously, spitting out wads of laundry. The poor woman had nearly suffocated to death when the 300 thread count sheets she’d been washing for someone had engulfed her in a hot embrace.
~
“Oh! What if Dad has some secret dark past that he kept hidden from us all,” her sister offered, a bit too cheerfully.
~
His last thought before it hit him was, ‘Should’ve known it would choose to fall on me.’ 
~ “Sorry, Harry. They’re mine now. You may be my kid, but we’re talking about cinnamon rolls, here. I’ll fight you if I have to.”
“I can still offer a healthy alternative,” Harry continued, as if not having heard his father. “How about rice cakes?” he suggested with an evil look. “Rice cakes are good for you.”
“Not if I kill myself first to avoid them.”
“Fine, you win,” Harry relented.
“You say that like there was a choice.”
“Don’t push it,” he warned. Getting to his feet, Harry grabbed his plate and moved to take his father’s.
Malcolm’s eyes widened a little. “You’re doing the dishes?”
“Yeah, you cooked so I’ll clean.”
“Harry, you’re really making a great case for head injuries,” Malcolm chuckled, getting up to follow his son. “You wash, I’ll dry.”
~
“I just said it. I didn’t know she was some wish granting demon-fairy-spirit-genie thing, did I?” he defended at the look he was getting.
“While not exactly helpful, your use of all four of those words does illustrate the staggering volume of beings you are contending with in identifying what sent you here.”
“Can’t you help me narrow it down a little?” said Harry. “You’re good at this. You’ve always been able to figure something out.”
The ghost sighed. “Am I to understand, in your universe, you often supply such little information for your heavy demands?”
“Pretty much.”
“I weep for my counterpart.”
~ “I just want everything to go back to normal. Like the wish never happened. I want to just go home.”
The Nighe nodded. “Yes, I thought you might. Your second wish?”
“I just want her to stay away from me. To not keep trying to change whatever prophecy she thinks she’s under.” Trying to word as carefully as possible, Harry faltered, thinking on the grief for her grandfather and the pressure of her own insignificance that had twisted Elena. “If she could…maybe…find some peace.”
Finley smiled at the words. “How kind you are. And your third wish?” 
After a few moments thought, the wizard asked, “You said big wishes usually go a little haywire?”
“The larger wishes tend to the way most people expect,” answered the Nighe.
“It’s like that monkey’s paw story. You know, how people get three wishes with it, but they end up becoming twisted forms of what they asked for. Not that,” he added, seeing Finley stare at him, “Not that I’m comparing you to a monkey’s paw or anything. Third wish…After wishes one and two, I’d like it if it got a lot harder for people to catch you. Yeah, I wish it’ll get a little harder for people to catch you,” repeated Harry. “Impossible, even. Give you some vacation time,” he said, casually. “I never get vacation time, but I hear it’s pretty nice.”
The Nighe stared up at Harry for a few moments, her green eyes shining with unshed tears. “Oh, yes,” she said, softly. “I would have been very proud had I had a son like you.”
~ I’ve never been too good at listening to people. And that’s what got me shot.
~ So, I’m missing the birth of my child and freezing to death. Such is the glorious life of a wizard.
~
“I came here in peace and you attack me!”
“You came here in disguise and under false pretences. I don’t call that peace.”
~
“Nuh-uh,” replied the five year old with the fervour every child has at that age.
~
“Rash?” he hissed, his voice cold. “I’m not going to do anything rash, Morgan. I’m going to kill him.”
~
“Damnit. Is there anything they can trace back to you from in there?”
“Not unless they can track fang marks to dental records…”
~
“Breathe, love. You look beautiful. He’s a nice guy. And if he hurts you, I’ll break his kneecaps.”
~ They are, by far, the most laid back people I have ever met. They were perfectly fine with their daughter staying with a man they didn’t know, taking my word for it that my son actually existed and was her friend. Then they asked for my address so they could send money.
~
“We should go; the cops will be coming soon.”
“Gee, I wonder why. Could it have been the freaking grenade you threw?”
~ I climbed out of the car and just barely saw the baseball bat swinging towards my head. Instinct took over, and I ducked, jabbed him in the ribs and swept his feet out from under him. Catching the bat, I smacked it into one hand while pressing down on the thug’s now broken ribs. They cracked beneath the pressure and the guy decided not moving was the better way to survive. 
~
“I saw your name in the yellow pages and the Lord told me to come here. In spite of…” her voice trailed off.
“In spite of my being in league with Satan?” I asked lightly.
~ Murphy hugged me. Then she hit me, saying, “Harry, you went into a burning building. You went into a collapsing burning building!”
~
“Give Morgan my regards.”
“So, basically, tell him to drop dead, right?”
“You know me so well.”
~ He glanced at the gun she was pointing at him, dismissed it without a second thought, and said, “He’s hurt.”
~ It is my firm policy not to refuse gifts from beautiful women wearing nothing by skimpy chain mail bikinis. 
~ He knew something. He did. He was looking at me with his patented ‘I know nothing’ look, which always failed. 
~ A suicidal ghost? You’ve got to be kidding me. How do you talk a ghost out of suicide?
~
“We need to stop at my place,” Murphy said, a fire growing in her eyes. Glad it wasn’t directed at me, because Lord knows I know the sort of armoury she has in her basement.
~
“I was under a spell; I had to tell the truth.” A rather predatory look glinted in his eyes. “However, I did not have to tell the whole truth. I left out the warnings.” Behind us, the mansion exploded. 
~
“And if we try and raid the place, what are we going to find?”
“Demons.”
“I don’t want to hear that…”
“Large, nasty dogs?”
~
“I know my French is bad, Bob. Instead of ranting about that for an hour, why couldn’t you have just written it in English?”
“Because it’s a French spell!”
~ He saw one of her officers finish emptying his gun into the huge monster from hell. He had to admire the way the man stood between what must have been an unbelievable nightmare and the young woman who stood in the corner, screaming.
~ “Do you, Luke? Do you really appreciate the gravity of the situation??”
“No,” he says firmly, meeting her eyes. “And neither will you, when you’re not drunk.”
~
“Oops!” Lorelai exclaims, and giggles as she stumbles into him. “Man, walking is hard!”
“We’re standing still,” Luke reminds her, bemused.
“Well, that’s tough, too,” she replies, untroubled.
~ Considering the state Will had probably been in when he penned it, it was impressively coherent, and intensely noble.
~
“No deathbed confessions. That was your rule.” She softens her words with a smile, and he visibly relaxes.
~ “I saved you from Guy’s wedding.”
“No I did. You provided a horse!”
“It was a romantic horse!” then realising the absurdity of the answer he sat back sulking.
~ “Gibson won’t allow it…it’s been too long since Gibson was tied to a tree.”
~ “You will go to Fleurberg, and one of you will conquer this so-called ‘Glass Mountain’ and win and wed the girl,” he ordered. “If it is you, Octavian, all to the good; we can unite the Kingdoms into one. If it is you, Alexander, that will be excellent too, since it will give you a Kingdom of your own. If it is you, Julian—which, may I add, I do not anticipate—” he had cast a jaundiced eye on his youngest son then “—at least we will be spared having to try to find something for you to do with your life.”
~ It might have been a very useful weapon in war, but the trouble was, the only time that the so-called “good” magicians would consent to do such a thing was when you were fighting against an “evil” magician. You could employ an “evil” magician, of course, but you could never trust him not to turn on you, and anyway, the moment you made use of such a tool, every “good” magician for hundreds of leagues around would come fight for your enemies because you were using an “evil” magician.
~ When you fought a man, you should be able to use straightforward tactics on him, and not have to wonder if he was going to set fire to you. When you met a woman, you should be able to tell at a glance what her station in life was, and know what to expect from her, and not have to wonder if she would seduce you or let you think you were seducing her, and then wake up turned into a pig.
~
“It adds a frisson of danger…”
“What does frisson even mean?”
“I think it’s French for fish. A fish of danger.”
~
“I’m sure you’re only getting revenge on me for eating that pie you were saving. But if you will leave a pie in the middle of the kitchen table and then announce that dinner has been put back an hour because the goose was bigger than you thought, what’s a man to do?”
~ “Can you fight?”
“Maybe not, but I make a damned good figurehead,” he replied, with a grim smile. 
~ “Daughter of Bast,” she replied, with a little bow. Cats liked to be reminded that they had once been worshiped.
~ …and here the cat used a word that didn’t translate into human terms. This was because it was the complicated, multilayered feline term, incorporating scent, sound, sight, magic-sight, and a sense that only cats seemed to have that somehow involved magic at a level completely alien to humans. It meant “something that is physical but is also extremely magical” with a modifier specifying “bad magic.”
~ Fixed Alan with her best glare, perfected through years of being able to show emotion only through the slit her veils allowed for her eyes…
~
She noticed the group followed an unspoken agreement to sleep in an almost circle around the campfire, spaced far enough apart from each other so snatching up weapons at a moment’s notice wouldn’t involve any awkward collisions, yet close enough together that there were no large gaps left unheeded and they preserved warmth.
~
He looked around, trying desperately to find another way out. Although, a little voice in his mind was constantly reminding him that if in the first part of his capture, when he could see clearly and wasn’t covered with itchy blood, he couldn’t escape why would now be any different. Intent on ignoring the little voice Alan spun his head around to the other side, searching for a rock? A sword? A helpful midget with a pair of scissors? Finding none he instead realised that head turning plus head injuries equals nothing good, and spent the next few minutes trying to breathe through nausea and whited out vision.
~ Alan had just come to the conclusion that he should shout some kind of a warning when two Will Scarlett’s burst out of the rock cover at the back of the camp, screaming “Robin it’s a trap” and madly waving their axes. Alan blinked his eyes and one Scarlett disappeared into a puff of smoke. He tried to blink them again, assuming that the other should too. He had to hallucinating. Surely no one was that stupid.
~
He was lying on his side on a stone floor. And it was obvious, from the bars directly in front of his face that he was in a dungeon. And we all know who owns the only dungeon nearby. Fan-bloody-tastic. 
~ He always had a shy smile for her, as though he were unsure of whether she really wanted one, but was pleased to give it anyway.
~ But, even after she had shaken her head, trying to force herself to concentrate on the actual plan, rather than this mad figment of her imagination, she realised that Robin was still talking about the same thing.
~
Robin’s plan, which Djaq had downgraded from lunatic to ‘perhaps able to work given the best luck in the world’ after some very deep thought, involved at least one of the outlaws being on the inside of the castle when the moment of opportunity arrived.
~ ..Going to have to commend her on her acting. Even he thought for a moment he was dying, which he knew very well that he wasn’t.
~ “Of course I trust you,” Will replied. “I just wouldn’t want you doing this if you were angry with me.”
~ “It is not normal,” Much said firmly, “for a man to go four days and Not. Stop. Smiling!”
~
“Me, Robin?” Thornton’s face was neutral, his voice just a little too innocent, “What gives you the idea that the plan was mine?”
~ “You screamed.”
“I did not scream.”
“Allan, I heard you. You screamed!”
“I didn’t scream! Look, it’s a bloody scary thing, seeing that little harpy with an arrow on the string so I would be perfectly justified in screaming, however, I did not. Screaming is something maidens do…and I am no maiden!”
~
“‘Bout time you showed up,” I said to Morgan. “I broke the law at least an hour ago, where’ve you been?”
~ He looked upset. As one might be, if someone showed up and started threatening someone else with a sword. “Who’s he?”
“Wizard police,” I answered.
“He has a sword.”
“Yeah, they do tend to.”
~ He folded his arms and gave the Warden an appraising look. I was impressed with his ability to appear intimidating while wearing a hospital gown and being all insubstantial and ghost-y. “You got a license for that sword?”
~ “You didn’t say you were breaking a law,” Jo said, looking dismayed. “You didn’t say you had laws. What happens if they find you guilty?”
“They cut off my head.”
“What?!” Jo whirled back to Morgan. “You can’t do that! You can’t just go around cutting peoples’ heads off! You have no authority!”
“S’okay, Jo,” I said.
“You’re okay with getting decapitated? ‘Cause, if you’re keen to die, maybe you want to change places with me? I wasn’t quite ready for it.”
~ “You get a trial, he said?” Jake asked. I nodded. Well, as much as you can nod with a sword at your throat. “Can I speak at it?”
“No,” Morgan intercepted.
“It’s not so much a trial as some people deciding whether or not to kill me,” I explained. “Don’t worry, though, I’ve been through one before. I still have my head.”
~
“Mr. Dresden,” Jake rolled his eyes. “I’m already dead. Whether I stay here or go somewhere else doesn’t bother me. I mean, it sucks, yeah, but I can deal with it. You don’t have to be dead. That bothers me. Murder bothers me.” He glared at Morgan. “And if I wasn’t dead... sword license my ass.”
~ “I’m past tired now. I’m into the stage where everything seems utterly hilarious.”
~ “I think you’ve moved enough mountains for today – you deserve a rest. I greatly appreciate your efforts, Mr. Dresden. I don’t have the slightest idea exactly what your efforts were, but I appreciate them nonetheless. By all means, go. And get some sleep.”
~ “Anyway, it worked. So, yay. Except for the part where they want to cut my head off. Again. Well, I suppose they never really stopped wanting to cut it off. Just sort of put it on the back burner. The want, not my head.”
“Are you nattering?” Bob asked, concerned.
~ Then I stopped glaring, because he wasn’t looking at me and there didn’t seem to be any point to it.
~ ‘You are to receive no outside communication,’ I mouthed, mimicking him. I was feeling very childish at this point. 
~
“You can’t—” Wizards and apprentices scattered as the locked doors they hid behind were blown off their hinges, a tall figure in a dark trench coat striding through. A rune-carved staff smouldered with fire as the figure quipped, “Huh. Looks like I could just come in here.”
~
“Would I lie to you, Dresden?”
“Many times.”
Morgan scowled and said, “I am not now.”
~
“Was that Bob’s actual metaphor?”
“No and I’m not about to repeat it as it involved porn stars, rabbits, and a two by four.”
~ Then she gasped as she really looked at me and breathed, “You look more and more like him every day, I swear.”
I smiled sheepishly and ran a hand through my hair, shrugging slightly. “Not my fault.”
~ “Not now. But you could. I’ve still got a long life ahead of me.”
“Not if you die here.” Okay, she has a point there.
~
“…is there a reason you’re only wearing a towel?”
Virg blinked then looked down before glancing back at me with a coy smile. “You like it?”
What. The. Fuck. The caveman part of my brain started bashing a stick against things and grunting. 
~
“Forget the towel,” she snapped, and my brain went ahead of me on that path until I snatched it back. “That came out wrong.”
~
My brain thawed after a moment and the caveman started bashing his stick harder against things, howling like mad. And abruptly I was tugging her back into another kiss, dragging her towards me.
~ As we puttered away, the first of the black and white’s arrived on scene to figure out why it looked like a tree had exploded in a parking lot.
~
Shining silver eyes stared into mine and it hissed, “Dresden.” Then those eyes flicked to Nick behind me and widened in fear. “Your…”
“My son, yeah,” I snarled.
~
“We got ice cream and I wasn’t sad. I think you should get ice cream too, ‘cause sometimes you look sad.” It was about at that point I decided I might just kidnap her and keep her for myself, so she could say wonderfully kid-like things like that all the time and cheer me up.
~
“He gave me a spiel about how Graylin would be better off in the care of the council and she was special and needed to be watched over. It was a nice spiel, actually, very enthusiastic.”
~ “Hey Murph, none of your people got eaten by an invisible monster when you came downstairs, did they?”
~
Enthralling someone, taking over their mind to do your bidding, is illegal in the magic world. It’s right up there with ‘thou shall not kill’ and ‘thou shall not mess with the time-space continuum’.
~ “How did you know where to come?”
“Oh, well, between one of the neighbours calling to report a man with a hockey stick was breaking into the house across the street, a report of strange noises coming from next door and the sudden malfunction of every car alarm on the block, you weren’t exactly hard to find. Also, the landlord at Blake’s old apartment building gave us the name of the gas station where Blake used to work. A guy there thought Blake was buying a house in this area. We ran a check with the real estate agents and found the house being leased to a guy who matched Blake’s description… How did you know where to come?” 
I thought. I thought really hard. I could not come up with a lie, I was too tired. “I cast a tracking spell on her tears,” I said.
~
“I’m going to find her,” I declared. “And I’m going to rescue her. I’m going to rescue the damsel in distress, defeat the bad guy and then, if I can find some beautiful woman, I’m going to kiss her before the credits roll.”
He rolled his eyes. “I meant specifics, Harry. What is your plan?”
“Oh.” I frowned. “Hold on, I have to come up with it first.”
~ “You’ll do. So, just make yourself seen once in awhile. Look worried, pace a little. Try to—”
“Harry, I have known you for 25 years, I can be you. You are not that multi-layered,” Bob interrupted, impatiently.
~
I tossed a ball of fire at him and he actually reached out to catch it. Like I said, kind of stupid.
~
The demon was there, staring at me angrily with no idea what to do. His job was to keep people from passing through he door, what was he supposed to do once they’d already done it? With an angry snarl he slammed the door shut.
~
He was transforming into...a guy a wearing what I would wear if I was gonna go kidnap someone.
~
She has this way of saying ‘Harry?’ that tells me instantly what she’s thinking. Here it was ‘do you have a head injury or are you actually coherent?’. You have to admit, it’s pretty impressive to put that much nuance into a two syllable word and a question mark.
“Can I just get a second?” I asked. “I have to...just gimme a second.”
“Harry...” ‘I don’t have time for this crap, wizard.’
~
“You were useful,” I assured him. “Are...will be. I’m going to sit down…Do that changey thing again.”
~
“I really hate this guy,” I stated, unnecessarily. “I am going to set him on fire or something. No I’m not, that wouldn’t be good. Let’s pretend I didn’t just say that, alright?”
~
“No, the victim’s wounds were most likely from a blood-spell,” he corrected.
“That’s illegal.”
“So is murder.”
“Touché.”
~
“Ha!” I said. “She’s not a magical genius.”
Bob rolled his eyes. “Yes, Harry, you are quite possibly more talented than a five year old girl. Bravo.”
~ I managed to turn my snort of laughter in a soft cough at the last second, but Murphy glared at me anyway. I don’t blame her. I’m not mature enough to be at a crime scene.
~ “Or you’ll do what?” In one move, the wizard swung the staff over and hit the other end onto the floor. At the gesture, the trickster’s body flipped in the air and slammed down on the wooden ground. “Ow, dammit!” he exclaimed. “That hurt!”
“Really? Huh.” Harry repeated the motion.
~ A gun. I’m expecting magical attacks and he’s got a gun, thought Harry as he landed heavily on the ground.
~ I carefully tugged her shirt off over her head, then manhandled her into one of my t-shirts, trying not to look the whole time and memorizing it anyway.
~
“How? I don’t have the slightest idea where I am or any sort of transportation back.”
The Metatron gave him a sardonic look. “You ask me,” he said, “politely.”
“Ah. Of course. Ask a man of unknown allegiance to transport me to my home when he doesn’t even know where it is.” Um, wow. Tones of perfect politeness, not a hint of sarcasm in face or voice, and still Morgan managed to mock the angel. I almost wanted lessons.
~ “I am,” the man said, “the Metatron, Herald of the Almighty and Voice of the One True God.” The capitals were audible.
I coughed and tried to get my menacing voice back. “Prove it.”
“Fine,” the man said, and abruptly acquired a set of wings.
~ She giggled, picked up the teddy bear again and skipped over to him. “I thought you appeared in a pillar of flame?”
“I got tired of having my suits drenched in fire extinguisher,” the man—the angel—said, dryly. 
~ His voice took on extra harmonics, extra layers, became deeper, became worthy of a capital letter itself. In the Voice, he said, “Clear off, you lot.” They cleared off. I nearly did myself. You don’t mess with a Voice like that.
~ Michael drove, I navigated, mostly by saying, “Go straight, straight, straight, keep going, no wait wait left! LEFT! There. Straight...” My finding spell isn’t terribly accurate when I’m relaxed, and with my nerves in the state they were it was a wonder it was working at all.
~ “How strictly forbidden?” I asked, idly, putting together some other pieces in my head.
Thomas raised an ironical eyebrow. “Let’s just say that if you feed off a child, you only do it once.”
~
“Or until the Apocalypse,” Thomas said, dryly. “Given your track record for mass destruction, that might come first.”
~ Thomas arched an eyebrow. “You spoke to God?”
Nobody can do scorn like a ten-year-old girl. “No, to the Metatron,” Jessie said. “Don’t you know anything?”
~ “But you’re more then that, aren’t you? You’re the Messiah.”
“Harry?” Murphy finally said. “Remember when you asked me to tell you if I’d thought you’d gone off the deep end?”
I thought a moment. “No.”
“Well, you have!”
“Okay. Stop it. Yelling at each other isn’t going to solve anything. But my objection stands. She’s ten, Harry. She can’t be the Messiah.”
“Um,” Thomas said. It was all he needed to say. We all swung around to look at Jessie, who, having lost the protection of Murphy’s arm, had backed away from me. Who had, in fact, backed off the pool deck entirely, onto the pool. She was standing on the glass-smooth surface, making not a ripple or a wave, about three feet away from the side of the pool.
~
Thank God, he was speaking in English. If they’d made me speak in Latin after the day I’d just had, I’m pretty sure I would have been obligated to shoot something.

“I can see you, Marize. Do you know what that means? It means I didn’t take out my contacts.” – Susan

“Has anyone here read the gospel of Thomas?” Thomas raised his hand.
“Egomaniac,” I said.
~ Tea is an excellent cure-all, I’ve found. Lose your keys? Tea. Miss rent? Tea. Zombies, misguided people in cloaks and random vampires making your life a misery and threatening your city? ...kick ass, then tea.
~
“They trying to hold us, you think?” I asked Thomas.
He nodded. “Almost certainly.”
“One would wonder for who,” I said.
“One would,” Thomas replied. We stared at the thugs. They did not provide the name of their employers. It was worth a shot.
~
I made my decision. “Okay, guys,” I said, “here’s the deal. We have to get out. Which means we have to rush them.”
Thomas gave me his Harry-you’re-an-idiot look. Murphy clarified. “Harry,” she said, “they’re right there.”
“So?” I asked. “You want I should telepathically communicate plans? Okay, here, I’m telepathically asking for a miracle right now.”
~ “‘Dear Mr. Dresden,’” I read, out loud, for the benefit of a smirking Thomas. “‘We understand that you bear a grudge against certain factions of the Black Court, and wish to inform you that three members of said factions will be lodging at blahbitty blah until two weeks hence. Should you wish to act upon this information, we suggest that you do so immediately. We have enclosed a map to further facilitate your movements. Yours etc. Interested Parties.’ What the shit is this?”
“Someone’s been reading too much Austen,” was Thomas’s opinion.
“Anonymous letters addressed to me aren’t supposed to be helpful.”
“If it makes you feel better, don’t go.” Thomas shrugged. “It’s probably a trap.”
“Of course it’s a trap. Everything these days is a trap. I’m going in, you coming with?”
“Might as well. No one’s tried to kill me yet, and I cannot say my week is complete without it.”
~ She dropped her eyes and hugged the teddy bear. I was, at this point, pretty sure she was lying. “Are you sure? One hundred percent sure?” She only nodded this time, didn’t actually say anything. Yep. Lying.
~
“What took you so long?”
“Mysterious things.” He looked over my shoulder. “Who is that girl and why did she just dive under your couch?”
~ “You smell like a horse. And your beard looks like you super glued road kill to your face.”
I smiled, “Well that just proves I’m alive. The dead have an entirely different horrible smell and the undead have far better fashion sense.”
~ The shower left me feeling a lot a cleaner than I had been in three months, but my hair smelled of strawberries and sunlight due to Murphy’s shampoo. I added getting some manly toiletries to my mental list of things to do.
~ “Do you know how to use it?”
“Of course.” Murphy skilfully unfolded the blade out from underneath the handle with just a flip of her wrist and placed two fingers on each side of the handle to control the blade, but it looked more like a weapon in her hands.
“I mean to shave with, not to give me a Glasgow smile.”
~ “Who the hell are you?”
“I the hell am Harry,” I answered. “Now its your turn, who the hell are you?”
~ “Well, it used to be DuMorne. Now that you’ve gotten rid of him, I guess it’s you,” the skull said merrily, as if things such as apprentices killing their masters happened twice a day.
~ “Can I trust you not to run?” the Warden asked, in a voice that clearly said he couldn’t.
“Yes,” I said stubbornly. “I think my ankle’s broken.” I jabbed my thumb back at my foot, which had thankfully begun to purple and swell by now.
~
“That’s your idea of fun? Making timid morticians spontaneously combust? And I thought Bob’s hobbies were bad.”
~ I suddenly became very conscious of the fact that Thomas was shirtless - he was sitting next to me in his standard household uniform of jeans, looking impossibly beautiful. It was a little unnerving.
~ “Do you have an off-switch, or are you stuck full-time in flirting mode?”
~ “What can I say? I’m irresistible. Even the little mortician thought so.”
“Butters is obsessed with polka. His taste is questionable.”
~ “The rest of them would probably rather cut your throat.”
“White Court,” he reminded me.
“You’re right. They’d rather get someone else to cut it for them.”
“At least Lara was still willing to use her connections for you, albeit because she thought I was blackmailing her. My enemies are usually a bit more straightforward about their feelings. You know, a curse here, an assassination attempt there.”
“As I’ve found out. Next time someone announces their intention to kill you, how about we hide out on a tropical island somewhere?”
“I refuse to face death in a Hawaiian shirt, Thomas.”
~
Thomas coughed. “There’s always a good reason for that.”
“And her name’s different every time.”
~ “Well, I couldn’t, then. Would have killed you dead, didn’t want that. But now, you can’t die, so really, not much a deterrent anymore.”
~ “You’re not human,” Ianto tells the pin-striped figure. He’s being rude, but the stranger just grins, his ancient, dark eyes oddly calming.
~ “It’s not my fault he ended up in that force field for a week. How was I supposed to know it was a restraint system?”
“Because I told you it was?” Tosh said.
“And I told you it was?” Gwen chimed in.
“And I told you it was? And, honestly, it wouldn’t have even been that bad if it hadn’t suspended me upside down the entire time.” 
~
“Cranky-pants? Rose, the universe is ending, Jack, Martha, and I are about to be eaten alive by pointy-toothed humanoids, and one of my greatest enemies is not only alarmingly not dead, but has stolen the TARDIS.” He leaned forward until his face was inches from where hers wasn’t. “Can you really blame my pants for being cranky?” 
She wrinkled her nose at him. “Have you always been this melodramatic, or is this a recent development?”
He grabbed a fistful of his own hair and pulled. “You are so very, very lucky that you’re only a figment of my imagination right now.”
~ “And where are you goin’ now?” he asked, voice still reasonable, but a little firmer.
“I’m gonna go get a bigger gun and go get my gorram stuff back’s what I’m gonna do,” Jayne told him, sounding like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
~ Although it has been stolen, miniaturized, shot at and eaten by various evil geniuses in their bid for World Domination over the years, it has always been rebuilt, usually by other evil geniuses who had nothing better to do after achieving World Domination.

Travellers wishing to make contact with an as yet undiscovered planet or time are reminded to keep hard evidence of their existence with them at all times; alien species have been known to be explained away on a regular basis.
~ Instead of answering, he tries to divert her attention, babbling about a million other things, about the 699 wonders of the universe (he claims to have blown up the 700th and knowing him it’s probably true)
~ Forty years on in his personal timeline, he burst back through the door that, to any outside observer, he had very carefully opened only minutes ago. That same outside observer would then also have been wondering how Jack had managed to run down the street while still being inside, so all things considered, it was good there wasn’t actually one.
~ “Could be a while. This wiring is a mess,” Jack responded, staring, bemused, at a handful of what appeared to be coloured spaghetti. He was sitting cross-legged on the deck, festooned with fibre-optic strands like a human Christmas tree.
~
“Good.” There was a pause. “If I ever see any of you ever again, I’m going to beat the living daylights out of you.”
“Fair enough.”
~ “Your presence has been requested by…” he looked up and saw her mouth the words ‘Magnificent Miss Maggie’ again, with an encouraging nod, “by the Magnificent Miss Maggie.”
~
She looked over as the door swung free then back at Ianto, as though for permission. Or possibly because she thought a secret door was clichéd. The look on her face was difficult to decipher.
~
“Your Majesty? Oh, Supreme Ruler? Oh, Great One that rules over all that is small and meek, yet is not like a dictator unto them?”
~ “You two haven’t seen a big threatening thing with great long claws and very very sharp teeth have you?” She smiles guilelessly at him.
“You mean,” he tries cautiously, “the werewolf?”
~ “Fine, whatever you say. Let me ask you this though, have you ever wondered how they get those little ships in those bottles?”
~ “She’s been cataloguing the storage room at their London headquarters and, singing your praises as the only one of the scientists that knew what paperwork was for.” Francine Jones had done no such thing, of course, she was still at the phase of cursing the idiots who’d been shoving alien technology at random into room after room and not even bothering with basic labeling, or sometimes even decent security.
~ “Do you think they’ll give us more if I mention the fire-breathing demon-bear?”
“They might think you’re insane.”
“And no one pays the mad. Good point. Best not to mention it, then.”

‘I don’t like that glint in your eye. The last time you looked like that, we had to apologize to a whole planet.’
‘Not the whole planet,’ she protested. ‘Just the eastern hemisphere.’
~ “How goes the divorce research?” 
“I’ve read this paragraph eight hundred and twelve times,” he said by way of an answer. 
“That well, then.” 
“Tell me Martha Jones, if it wouldn’t be a terrible inconvenience would you mind staying married to me so that I can stop reading this?”
“That’s the nicest proposal I’ve ever got from someone I’m already married to.” 
“I’ll take that as a yes.”
~ Sorry, but who are you again?  I know you said UNIT, but I thought that was like a secret service sort of thing.  I mean, until a few hours ago, I didn’t even believe it existed.  And you’ve probably noticed, but I’m public enemy number ... well, I’m in the top three.  So if this is an arrest, I’d like to know now, so I can make a quick escape and save the world.”
~ “Isn’t that a bit ... impossible?” 
“You use that word a great deal, usually in regards to things which are entirely possible. This is just difficult.”
~ And Dorothy, please check the dimensional stabiliser, if it still exists, and let me know if we’re about to explode.

“No,” he was saying, “I want you all back in Cardiff in three days.  And you absolutely cannot keep the Yeti.”

~ In going through the recovered Kryptonian data crystals, he had found schematics for a neat little device that stored items in a pocket dimension. The device was currently disguised as a gold coin and was keyed to his brainwaves.
~ “Kent, what the devil have you gotten yourself into now?” Henderson asked. His expression was more amused than annoyed.
“I was the first on the scene, got clipped on the back of the head as I was calling 9-1-1, lost my cell phone,” Clark told him. “Officer Brown found me there, made some assumptions, and here we are. I’m still waiting for my lawyer, by the way.”
~ “The reason I’m here is that I was called out of my nice warm bed by the Police Commissioner to ‘observe’ this investigation. He called me right after getting off the phone with the D.A. who had gotten reamed by the mayor who had just gotten an earful from the editor of Metropolis’s largest newspaper concerning reports of police brutality and stupidity concerning his favourite reporter. Do I need to go on?”
~
“And, uh, you’ve never impersonated a police officer?”
Clark felt his cheeks warm. “Okay, but just once. And the statute of limitations has run out on that and I did tell their rights.”

“Such a worrywart, J’onn,” Wally clapped a hand to J’onn’s shoulder. “Better be careful yourself, or you’ll form an ulcer in your old age.”

“I decided I want kids…so I just need a Fertile Myrtle and I’m ready to go.”

“Are you really Percy Weasley?” Oliver asked. “Quick, what did I do the night my greatest ambitions at Hogwarts were realized?”
“You cried for an hour straight and then went to sleep holding the Quiddich Cup.”
~ “Perce, you—” “It’s incredibly dangerous, Oliver, don’t bring it up now,” Percy said very quickly and loudly enough to drown out Oliver’s hissed ‘sneak people out of the country’.
~ “Pretend I’m drunk,” Percy ordered, as he downed his gillywater. “Yes, I heard this fantastic song the other day called ‘A Wizard’s Staff Has a Knob on the End’ and in the spirit of universal brotherhood, I feel I ought to sing it.” 
If Oliver had not understood why Percy was pretending to be drunk, he knew well enough that Percy’s singing voice was the stuff of nightmares. And not the strange ones with talking cabbages, but the really terrifying ones where Snape force-fed you poisons or you were hit repeatedly by a bludger and could never play Quiddich again. Oliver still had nightmares about Percy singing in the shower from their days at Hogwarts and woke up screaming to try and drown out the sounds in his head. He had never been so glad when he heard that Prefects had their own bathrooms at the beginning of fifth year. “You- you wouldn’t really sing, would you Percy?”
“Just watch me,” Percy said, shoving his glasses up his nose and taking a deep breath.
“Right, you’re too drunk to be in public,” Oliver exclaimed extraordinarily quickly, grabbing Percy’s arm and dropping a galleon on the bar. 
~ I might also point out that I’ve played Quidditch for the past four years, whereas you sat behind a desk writing memos.” He flexed his arms in a vaguely threatening way that was extremely effective.
~ “I suppose I don’t have anything else left to live for,” Percy said philosophically. “One cannot be happy with the perfect filing system all the time, after all. My family’s cast me out and I don’t have a girlfriend, so….”
“So you’ve chosen a life of filing and incredibly dangerous subterfuge against the Ministry when you’ve run out of paper clips?”
Percy contemplated this a moment. “That seems to be the gist of it, yes. I must say, I am so very pleased to hear you use the word ‘subterfuge’ correctly. I didn’t know you knew it.”
“Subterfuge has to do with tactics,” Oliver explained patiently. “Tactics have everything to do with Quidditch. Of course I’d know it. But Perce- really? You’ve been smuggling Muggleborns out of the country?”
“After I break them out of Azkaban, yes. It’s actually beginning to sound more dangerous now that I’m talking about it… ah, there’s the blind terror kicking in, just as expected.” Percy collapsed onto the couch, put his head into his hands, and suddenly thought that it would be quite horrible to die. “Oh God, I’m going to be dead by Tuesday.”
“No you’re not,” Oliver said heartily, sitting down next to Percy. “I’m sure you’ll live until Friday. They’d want you to work a full week.”
~
“Well now you make it sound like blatant stupidity,” Percy retorted.
“That’s pretty much what bravery is, Perce. Now, you’re on an excruciatingly dangerous, self- appointed mission that reeks of death and danger and that is really unlikely to lead to any route but certain death and you didn’t ask me to help?”
~
“I’m going to ask him where she is.”

He was sitting upright, at least, in a chair or something similar. Here goes. Mal strained at the bonds holding his arms bound to the chair’s arms–-and nearly smacked himself in the face as they flew up, unhindered by ropes or restraints of any kind. His arms weren’t tied up. Mal moved his legs experimentally. He wasn’t tied up at all. He filed this under Deeply Suspicious.
~ Why the hell would they stick him in an office? ‘I’m still unconscious. That has to be it. And I’m having a nightmare about corporate offices. I’ll walk out the door, and I’ll be wearing’ some gorram suit and some idiot will be going on about pointless drone-work and then I’ll wake up screaming. And then I’ll be tied up and in some cell underground, like I should be.’ It occurred to Malcolm Reynolds that there might just be something skewed about his sense of normalcy.
~
“He’s ruining it! Do something!”
“What can I do? I am a figment of your imagination…”
~
“He ran guns for the resistance.”
“Which resistance?”
“He won’t say. Apparently, they didn’t win.”
~ Jayne was already there, laying down covering fire and swearing. “...gorram armor, can’t even get a gorram killin’ shot, ‘less I get lucky and hit ‘em between the gorram eyes...” His pistol clicked, and he hunched back down behind the crates to reload. 
~ Inara wouldn’t have believed she could still move fast–but flying bullets were a wonderful incentive.
~ “He got shot,” said Inara, raising her voice to be heard over the noise of the battle. “And Mal got captured.”
“Typical,” muttered Jayne……
“Cap’n get himself caught?” she asked wearily. Inara nodded, not trusting herself to speak. Zoë sighed. “Typical.”

“Put down your weapon. I’m going to count to five.” The man seemed unsure of himself.
She cocked the gun with a grin, and aimed it straight at his heart. “I’m going to count to three.”
~
In a small corner of Lori’s mind, she thought how ludicrous it was that her dad was trying to intimidate a giant fucking robot.
~ “You can scream, if it would make you feel better.”
“Ironhide!” Will snaps, “Don’t scare her!”
“What? Humans tend to relieve themselves of fear by screaming, do they not?”
“No, no, no – they scream to show fear.”

There was a long pause as Judy Witwicky launched into a lecture involving the responsibilities of law enforcement officials and missed curfews, during which Optimus Prime shifted his feet uncomfortably.
~
Because, let’s be honest, it’s a field. Look. Do you see another world out there? No, you see a field. Do you see anything non human? No, and you know why? Because it’s a field!
~ “Does the eagle fly at midnight?” I asked him sarcastically, when he hung up on the third call.
“Reinforcements are on their way,” he replied.

“Ramirez. Carlos. Cavalry.”
“Dresden, Harry,” I returned. “Dead man walking.”
~ “I understand the fate of the universe may depend on my ability to do a spell,” she replied. “So, great.”
~ Carlos grinned again. “He’s not so bad if he doesn’t hate you.”
“I wouldn’t know what that’s like,” I said.
~
“No,” Morgan said. “Return to your body.” I bet that’s an order he doesn’t get to give very often.
~
“I’ll take over the spell and stop it,” I decided. “That way if it messes up my brain and I die, you guys can still do your job and I won’t be any worse off than I will be at dawn anyway.” Nobody made an argument, which, really, they could have done to be polite.
~ “It looked as if the designer threw up ‘stereotypically cute and romantic’ all over the room and then seasoned it with ‘tacky as hell’.”

“Dear God,” Richard groaned. “I’m never letting them visit the Southern states again; now that he’s old enough to know what one is, Jason will bring home an alligator. At least Kala likes cute furry things.”

Traya blinked. “But you don’t even know when it’ll be.”

Dick hadn’t put a lot of effort into picking out the groomsmen’s clothes. His sole edict, months ago, had been “Wear pants,” which hadn’t made any sense until Robin remembered Roy and Gar would be in attendance.

“So let me get this straight, you don’t believe in the afterlife, but for some reason it matters that we find the perfect place to bury your rat?”
“There is no afterlife,” he said, “but I’d rather not spend the next three years of this life at Guantanamo answering questions about why we were burying unmarked packages within three miles of a federal building.”
Wilson nodded when he saw the surveillance camera pointed at them. “Right,” he said. “Somewhere else sounds like the perfect place.”
~ “She betrayed us!” howled the marquise, almost in hysterics.
“That would mean that at one point in time, I owed loyalty to you,” Marguerite retorted.
~ “Dirt-on-my-rugs!” screeched Louise, as soon as Marguerite opened the door.
“Greetings, Mademoiselle,” said Sir Percy’s valet, wincing as Louise hit him on the side of the head with a feather duster.
~ “But here, I…brought you a new quill.” He rummaged through his pockets and managed to find a novelty peacock feather quill Dolores had given him for his birthday. Percy had been in the habit of carrying it around with him on the off chance that he could force the ugly thing off on someone else.
~
“Sir Percy has wonderful taste in clothes!” Lockhart gushed, showing, once more, the Hufflepuff ability to zero in on important details.
~ Neither of them also actually knew how to buy clothes, either. They knew the general principals (you buy what fits) and both had Methods of buying clothes (Percy generally told Madame Malkin that he worked in the Ministry and gravitated towards things with pinstripes; Oliver told Madame Malkin that he was a Quiddich player and bought clothes that hid bloodstains).
~ “Sorry,” he said, in unaccented English. “Sometimes I have to pretend I don’t understand English when she’s around. It’s the only way for her to let me be. She goes out to the library and looks things up in the German-to-English dictionary and leaves me alone in my bedroom.”

“Murder, Lex? I might be wrong — I’m not a lawyer — but I think that might be a breach of parole. Not sure.”

~ “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” Tim put a hand to his heart, looking so earnest and angelic, she half-expected a halo to appear.
~ “You’ve got to train him,” Dick said, smothering a grin as he settled on the couch. “I think you have some experience in that.”
Bruce raised an eyebrow. “Not unless you want it trained to retrieve batarangs.”
“Well, not the explosive ones, certainly.” Dick’s grin emerged, positively beatific.
~ The puppy wriggled, and Cass smiled. “Soft,” she pronounced with the kind of glee usually reserved for new martial arts moves.
~ “Lie down,” Bruce said, using the voice that stopped police officers in their tracks and made villains quake in fear.
The puppy yipped happily and trotted up to nose against his ankle.
~ It wasn’t long before it seemed that Clark had always been in their lives: chewing on very expensive dress shoes, tripping anyone carrying a delicate object, or lying at Batman’s feet in the cave.
~ He thought of walking out, until he saw a young man mixing an entire bottle of vodka into a punch bowl by the illumination of a string of red chili pepper lights and nodding as Professor Barker droned on, from his seat at the kitchen table about “The Great War.” Jim wasn’t sure if Barker was sharing personal experiences, or if someone had failed to tell him that his history lecture had ended.
~ “I don’t know about this, Babs. He was too damned cheerful on the phone. Like. ‘aliens have been playing with my mind’ cheerful.
~ “My most humble apologies,” Hank gasped, kneeling to help his friend pick up the scattered papers, “but I hope you will pardon my haste when I inform you of a truly infelicitous circumstance, which presents, I dare apprehend, the most critical dilemma –”
“Can you speak English?” 
~ Scott, being not only male but legitimately colour blind, was thankfully spared from the conversation.
~ One of the most important men in my life has, from time to time, been referred to as a tactical genius. I have witnessed him draw up a complex battle plan, complete with half a dozen contingencies, in the time it would take most people to order a pizza. I have seen him watch all of his contingencies dissolve, then shift without blinking (metaphorically, as well as from necessity) to a completely new approach.

‘‘How dare you say that!’’ a voice suddenly cried. ‘‘I never steal!’’
‘‘No, you give yourself gifts which belongs to others!’’ Chiana replied.

He was pretty sure nobody’s arms and legs and tentacles were supposed to bend that way, and unless June had gotten dipped in a giant tie-dye vat, she was wearing a little bit of everybody’s innards on her outers.
~ A few looked afraid now that they knew, but Jeff couldn’t sympathize. He had warned them all just before they hit him with the pipe.
~ “No, in order to reject, one has to listen. Bruce Wayne only listens to himself, regardless of subject or circumstance. In his mind, he is the authority on all matters. There is no real room for a god.”
~ Then she sighed and grumbled, “Well you two are definitely related. Only someone related to you, Harry, could annoy me this much.”
“That’s a compliment,” intoned Harry towards Xander with a grin.
“No, its not,” said Murphy.
~
“Morgan apparently found him facing off with a Red Court vampire.” 
She looked at him, surprised; he blinked back, asking, “What? I almost got sacrificed once to open a portal to Hell. Vampires are cake.”
~ “I feel like a princess shut up in the castle. Aren’t you supposed to be the prince who rescues me, rather than the jailer?”
“I like to think of myself as more of a guardian, without all that aristocratic entitlement baggage that goes along with the prince motif.”
“So this is more of a republic than a feudal monarchy? Very well, I vote to go out.”
“I veto your vote.”
“You can’t veto my vote. Princes can’t vote. I’m going out.”
~ “There’s nothing more depressing than being alone when everyone else has someone,” Olive muttered.
“I can think of several things. War, famine, the fact that one day something horrible will happen to the earth and the human race will be forgotten in the void of space, orphans in New Guinea, and the fact that the woman I’m passionately in love with doesn’t realize that my heart burns for her with the intensity of a thousand white-hot suns.”
“What was that last one?” Olive blinked, having not been paying attention until that moment.
Alfredo calmly took a sip of his espresso. “Orphans in New Guinea.” 
~ She had conditions; which included no guns or drugs. If you had either, you left them with a mate, ½ a mile away. Break the rules and the chances of being knocked out, shaved everywhere, died in the colours of whoever’s beating Wales in football/rugby/cricket etc and left handcuffed to a traffic light increased, exponentially.

Amelia nodded, understandingly and made few quiet calls to her five brothers (three of which worked in departments that required people to sign non-disclosure forms before they could know the name of the department).
~ “Let me get this straight: werewolves exist. We caught a werewolf. The Queen just called to tell us that the Royal Family are werewolves and that we currently have the Prince of Wales stuffed into a large dog cage…Anyone know how he likes his tea?” 
“With Retcon.”
~ “So if I call for back up, and we take you in, you’re saying that time could unravel.”
The Doctor smiled at Ianto, “Exactly! So if you’d be so kind as to let me go on my way, the universe would be very grateful.”
~
“I’m making popcorn…”
“Well, why don’t you use the microwave in the kitchen?”
“Someone needs to clean it, it smells like popcorn.”
~
“We’re in the stairwell. We’re climbing up the stairs. I’m breathing heavily.”
“Ok, you really don’t need to be updating me as much as you’re updating me.”
~ “I don’t want to go to that stupid snake house anyway.”
“Your grandfather was a Slytherin.” “Yeah, and he smells like moldy cheese.”
~ “The architect prided himself on his sense of humor, but not as much on his sense of utility,” Grandpa said one day, when Sam asked why there were real live banana trees growing in the bathtub of the third floor bathroom.
~ Still trying to orient himself, Sam disentangled the sheets around his legs, annoyed. “How the hell did you get in here?” he demanded. Dean looked surprised at the question. “Door was open.” “No, it wasn’t.” Sam might be going crazy, but he wasn’t yet crazy enough to stay in a motel in an unknown town and not lock the door. “Let’s say it was,” said Dean, and what the hell was that supposed to mean?
~ “A hundred and ten million dollars,” Sam calculated, automatically. Then he paused. “A hundred and ten million dollars?” His voice got kind of squeaky at the end.
~ “Hey, listen, you can call me Dean—” He stopped, because Rimple was staring at him like he’d suggested Rimple could cut off his own head. “You can’t call me Dean?” Rimple shook his head, very fractionally. “Right,” Dean muttered. Sam was sniggering into his hand. Dean kicked him under the table.
~ “Er, that’s a bit odd, now. Their kind don’t usually go for boys.” He lowered his voice. “I, er, wouldn’t suppose—”
“Yeah, not by a long shot,” Dean said. “And I still don’t believe in you,” he told the unicorn, which ignored him and mumbled at his hair affectionately.
~ “Muggles did not burn your great-grandmother at the stake, I met her last year in Diagon Alley!” Clyde said.
“My other great-grandmother,” Wyndham said, injured.
~
“Absurd,” Caldwick said loudly. “I suppose that we are simply expected to take the witness’s word for—”
“Shut up, Caldwick, before you get yourself in a blood feud,” said one of the other examiners, a big guy with a ponytail of bright red hair. “Feklar of Ragnuk, do you give this testimony under your clan-name?”
“Yes,” Feklar said.
“Right-o,” the wizard said. “Examiners, can I have a word?” He whispered to the rest of them for a few minutes, and then he turned back and said, “The board thanks Feklar of Ragnuk for his testimony. No further questions for the witness.”
~
“You acknowledge debt? You wish opportunity to repay?”
“Uh, sure,” Dean said, a little warily. “Not in the handing over my firstborn kind of way, but yeah, if I can do something for you, say the word.”
~ “What are you even going to do with six kids for a month?” Sam said.
“What did I do with you when you were twelve?” Dean said.
“You taught me how to fire a shotgun, and we salted and burned my pet goldfish after it died,” Sam said.
~ The portrait said. “Password?”
“Huh, let me think,” Dean said. “Is it, open the fuck up before I cut you out of that frame and torch you?”
The portrait stared at him and said, “Er, remarkably accurate,” and swung open.
~
“The books know me now, they won’t give the alarm,” like that was supposed to make Dean feel better, that books full of dark magic knew Sam.
~ If demons could be in good moods, then Crowley was in one. It felt very… foreign. Almost sinful. It also lured him into a false sense of comfort. Because Crowley was caught totally off-guard when Freddie’s voice suddenly stopped singing “Fat Bottom Girls” and started addressing him directly. “… they make the rockin’ world go CROWLEY. CROWLEY, YOU THERE?”
~ “I’m not bloody baby-sitting again!” Crowley said, nearly shouting. If he were the shouting sort. On general principle, he didn’t shout. It wasn’t cool. “And I hate America!” 
“YOU HATE EVERYTHING, CROWLEY. YOU’RE A DEMON.” A pause. Then, Freddie said, in a slightly more suspicious tone: “DOES THAT MEAN YOU ACTUALLY LIKE ENGLAND?”
“I… well, I… Bugger.”
~ Crowley and Aziraphale got their briefings, each from their respective authorities, and the details and instructions were disturbingly similar. They all boiled down to: Keep them on the right track, and don’t bugger it up this time.
~ “Ow! Jesus Christ, I have a broken leg here!”
“Yeah, and I’m carrying 180 pounds of dead weight here. Do you hear me whining?”
~ “‘This’ll be an easy job, Landon,’” Landon says. “‘We’ll be in and out of there in no time, Landon.’” 
“You want to waste your breath on sarcasm now?” Alex watches warily as the soldiers creep closer, marching across the empty field with a kind of dogged, inevitable determination.
~ “I’m Sam and he’s Dean…and you’re Landon. I know. Can we do the meet and greet when there isn’t an army of ghosts riding our asses?”
~
“We’re not brothers,” said Sam, as if talking to a small, and not particularly bright, child. “We just met.”
“Not cool, subconscious,” Jo said in an undertone. “Not cool.”
“She talks to herself a lot,” Dean explained to Sam.
~ “That’s a flamethrower,” says Nathan, shocked.
Dean looks like Christmas came early for him. “Sweet,” he says as Ash hands him the pack. His eyes light up and he suddenly seems years younger. “I’ve always wanted one of these.”
“You made one in high school,” Sam says, and he seems amused at Dean’s unfettered delight.
“Yeah, but this one is legit,” says Dean. He turns the pack over in his hands, examining it. “Goddamn. We’re gonna test this baby out tonight.”
~ “And I apologize if Dean was, is, or will be an ass to you.”
~ “It’s our one vacation of the year, Sam,” says Dean vehemently. “We don’t even get Christmas off, for God’s sake.”
“Yes, we do—” Sam begins to contradict (Dean is convinced that it’s a reflex at this point), but he pauses. Dean imagines the memories of Christmases past parading across Sam’s brain. “Huh. Well.”
“Last year, mutant reindeer,” says Dean, ticking off the list on his fingers. “Year before that, Jack Frost went psycho. Year before that, man-eating Christmas trees.”
~ “Please,” says Dean, unimpressed. “Don’t pull that ‘you’re-scared’ shit on me. I invented it.”
Sam coughs into his fist, and it sounds suspiciously like “chickenshit.”
~
“You sure you want to be seen talking with me?”
“Half the school thinks I’m gay and the other half thinks I eat babies for dinner,” said Sam. “I don’t think talking to you can do much more damage.”
~ “I think you might be the most boring drunk in the universe,” said Dean conversationally. “One beer and you’re out like a light.”
~
“How do you feel about Eskimos?”
“The pies or the people?” Sam doesn’t look up from his copy of the Idaho Press-Tribune. “And if we’re talking about the people, I think they prefer to be called Inuit.”
~
“How will we make it across the border with a car full of weapons? And you being legally dead?”
~ “Knowing our luck, it’s some bridge troll that sucks on human bones for a nice midnight snack and then strings the skulls into necklaces for his butt-ugly girlfriend,” Dean mutters.
“That’s… scarily detailed, Dean.” Sam rubs at his eyes, trying to see something beyond multicolored flashes of light.
~
“You are not pregnant,” said Sam, exasperated. “You can’t be pregnant. You’ve only been a girl for a day and I’m pretty sure you haven’t had sex with a man recently. Or, ever. Unless you have something to tell me. Indigestion?” Sam suggested. 
“No. It’s not really the same feeling. It sort of. Aches. Like the muscles in my abdomen are all in a knot. I can’t explain it.”
Sam didn’t know much about these sorts of things, he admitted, but… “Dean. It’s the other thing.”
“What other thing?” But Sam clearly knew more than Dean did.
“You know.” Sam tried to force as much emphasis as he could into it, without actually saying it. “The other thing.”
“What?” A pause. Dean’s eyes widened again. “Oh. Oh. Fuck. But this is so unfair!” Dean wailed. “I mean, doesn’t this sort of thing only happen for like five days out of the entire month? Why today?! I’ve only been a girl for one fucking day!”
~ “Sam, did you just hear the wolf talk?” Dean asks out of the side of his mouth.
“I did if you did.” Sam looks equally bewildered.
~
“Phil? It’s ‘Superman Lives’ for the front page… They let Lois into the hospital room and he wouldn’t dare die on her.”
~
“We were betrothed, but I believe that shooting arrows at your fiancé is just one way of saying I would rather marry a snake.” He grinned ruefully. “Although she said that, too.”
~
“No one’s ever made you a present?”
“Anna gave me a migraine on my sixteenth birthday, as well as an interestingly shaped scar on my right knee, but I don’t think that counts.”
~ “Hi,” said Legolas, testing out the word. He looked awkward doing so. Harry received the sudden bizarre impression that elves were never meant to talk in slang.
~ “I didn’t know you had a headquarters,” I said. “I thought you guys had some sort of wrong-doing alarm implanted in your brains.”
“That’s just him. I think he’s a robot. One day, something is going to punch him in the chest and come out with a hand full of wires.”
“I can hear you, Ramirez,” Morgan said.
“Sorry, boss,” Ramirez called. He turned to me, widened his eyes and mouthed ‘robot!’
~ “I noticed the discrepancy,” Batman smoothly interjected. “And have prepared for that contingency.”
“Of course he has,” Flash observed caustically.
~ “Uh...” he looked at his watch. “9:30 am.” He tapped it. “It’s been 9:30 am for the last three days, though. I need to get it fixed.”
~ “I’m just a bit busy freaking out over my impending death,” I explained. “If there’s some sort of ‘how did you like your warden service?’ comment card, I’d be happy to fill it out for you.”
~
I kept my mind alert by trying to figure out how to say ‘it’s not my fault, please don’t kill me’ in Latin.
~ At one point, his arm moved in my direction and six pairs of disapproving eyes landed on me. I hunched down into myself like I was a five-year-old who’d broken an expensive vase and was relieved when the eyes moved back to Morgan.
~
“Wizard Dresden,” the Merlin addressed me. “Do you have any objections to your trial being conducted here?”
“Um...no, I guess,” I answered. “I have few objections to it being done now, though.”
“Your objections are noted,” the Merlin said. “Your trial will begin in fifteen minutes.”
~
I took an unsteady step away from the wall and fought against the urge to face plant. One step, two steps. “Red steps,” I muttered. “Blue steps.” I frowned at myself and drawled in a Bob-like accent: “Now is not the appropriate time for Dr. Seuss, Harry.” Bob, scarily enough, is often the voice reason in my head. Which is probably a good thing, since I seem to have misplaced my own somewhere along the way.
~ He hasn’t liked me since I insulted his tie when I was fourteen.
~ Morgan translated rapidly for him, believing maybe, that if he talked fast enough that the words wouldn’t be as offensive. It wouldn’t have worked–the Council all spoke English; they just insisted on Latin to make those of us who were born in the last hundred years feel inferior.
~ He was attempting to ignore Mai’s glare, but at any moment, the left side of his face was likely to burst into flames and melt.
“She’s going to eat me, isn’t she?” he asked.
“Sleep with one eye open,” I suggested.
~ “I’m sorry, sir.”
“What are you apologizing for, now?”
“It’s pre-emptive,” I explained. “I’m about to pass out on you.”
~ “Wait a minute, you checked his films? How did you get your hands on them?
“I know a guy.
“Any of these guys you know ever hear of patient confidentiality?”
~
“Don’t worry about my body temperature, either,” the Doctor added. “The frost will be perfectly normal. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to pass out. Please hold all questions, comments, and accusations ‘til I’m awake again. I’ll be happy to confuse you then.”
~ “…and we do not have a ghost.”
“And that’s all true, apart from the part where you have a ghost.”
~ “I hate ghosts.”
“You didn’t believe in ghosts.”
“That was before one threw a clipboard at my head!”
~
“The part where we renovated the press room? And tore out the floor, and poured about fifty tons of concrete into a big hole in the ground? Remember how we did that?”
“Not you personally, Josh,” pointed out Donna. Josh looked a little put out.
“I contributed.”
“If by contributed you mean you shouted at the contractors a few times.”
“I ...was encouraging them.”
“They hated you.”
“Yeah, but they loved me.”
“They wanted to drop a concrete block on your head.”
“That’s a sign of love in the contracting business.”
~
Josh scowled at him. “Whose side are you on?”
“I have no side. I am side free. I’m a circle.”
~ “We’d need a distraction. One heck of a distraction,” said Leo.
“And we’re back at burning something down,” said Dean, satisfied.
~
He snaps his fingers in slow-motion and she gets that it’s Rich Guy Code for, I apologize but I have completely forgotten who you are.
~ “They don’t know that we’re here? Nah, I bet they have all sorts of sensing equipment, some of which you probably developed!”
“Exactly!” Henry grinned. He held up a small, black box. “And what I developed, I can outsmart.”
~
“Hey!” Jack said, affronted. “That accidental satellite launch? So not my fault.”
~ “What are you doing, Shawn?” Gus hissed. “How are you going to find that woman?”
“No idea!” Shawn replied enthusiastically. “But did you see that thing with the frost? That is seriously bad ass.”
~ “This isn’t a date, Shawn. This is an investigation.”
“Yeah, but we’re going undercover.”
Gus looked at him sharply. “There will be no covers, Shawn. Under or otherwise.”
~ A demon would know his situation, and he was pretty sure aliens wouldn’t have played Metallica. So that left abducted by the government.
~ “Let’s take this indoors then. Come to think of it, I think I’d better take you home.”
“You know where I live?” Tony looked at Lex in amazement. 
“Not a clue. But I’m assuming you do.”
~
“Ow, damnit. Why did I do that? I knew it was hot. I could hear the sizzling and I took it out of the oven only a few seconds ago using extremely thick gloves. But, no, I just tried to move it out of the way using my bare hand anyway. Ow.”
~ After a few prostitutes, addicts, a transvestite and a midget, he wonders why New York seems determined to live up to its stereotypes.
~ Reed had thought that Captain Turner was skilled with a blade, but this man is more than dangerous: he is a weapon. In one smooth motion he thrusts the sword in his left hand through a man’s throat, slashes the sword in his right hand across another man’s belly, and reverses his first blade to spear a third man through the heart. He does not pause, does not speak; he merely kills.
~ “What would I do without you?”
“Have to learn Ancient Sumerian and make your own potions, I’m guessing.”
~ “Hello,” she answered. “I’d ask how you are, but —”
“But the answer seems a bit obvious?”
“I was going to say that you’d bypassed the portion of the visit where we indulge in social niceties.”
~ “You don’t know?” asked the Doctor. “You mean you never asked why? You never said ‘Oi, if I’m going to be blowing things up and killing people can I at least know what’s going on?’ Tell me you at least asked that.”
~ “Ah, there you are! I thought you’d managed to get lost between the door and the bar. Barmy’s done it before now, haven’t you Barmy?”
Bertie smiled cheerfully at the young man perched beside him who was studying his drink with a look of vague confusion.
“What?” He asked, looking up at Bertie with a slight frown. “Oh, yes. Hundreds of times – Bertie what is this?”
“It’s plum brandy, Barmy. You just ordered it a minute ago.” 
“…So I did.” Barmy said, his face lighting up with a smile of remembrance. “Oh jolly good!”
~
“You could tell they were getting along famously – after about fifteen minutes they didn’t even need words to communicate.”
“They sat in silence, sir?”
“Well…yes.” Bertie admitted after a pause. “But it was a meaningful silence, Jeeves. One that suggested confessions of love were silently taking place.”
~ “I always carry one.” Jack said. “Just in case – you’d be surprised how often you’d need one.”
“‘Just in case’?!” Rose echoed in disbelief. “When is an engagement ring ‘just in case’?!”
~ The Doctor swore. Bertie was about to berate him to mind his language in front of a lady when Rose echoed him emphatically.
~ ‘Let’s just say that I was in a rather... restrictive establishment. To remove myself physically had proved to be rather a problem, so I was forced to look for other methods of liberation.’
‘You were in prison?’
‘It lacks a certain poetry when you put like that, but yes, that’s essentially correct.’
~ The coat swirls some more, making Rhys think of those shampoo adverts where carefully directed breezes fan out models’ shiny curtains of hair around their shoulders. Rhys lifts his arms up, looking down at his own just-hanging-there jacket--the weather never conspires to make him look good-- then gives himself a little shake.
~
“Did you ever get resurrected from the dead? Because if not, I’m going to win.”
The Doctor strides forward, catching them up. “Nine times, so far,” he says cheerfully. 
“Nine?” says Jack. “Is that all? I lost count at around thirty eight. Did you ever bleed out after being poisoned and having all your major organs eaten by a pack of ravening Jharga beasts? Let me tell you, that one hurt.”
~
“So, Zhaan, good to see you again.” The Doctor leans closer, conspiratorially. “Do you mind telling me what I just took charge of?”
~ Being tossed into prison upon arrival was not new. Neither was their impending death. Though the godly sacrifice thing was rather original. ~
“I know that face,” The Doctor groaned. “What did you do?”
She looked down demurely but her eyes glittered with pure mischief. “I might have threatened to rain down fire and destruction if my consorts weren’t released.” She shrugged. “Had to go through with my threat, is all. Think they’re halfway to the next city by now.”
~
“And we are totally not going to break in and search the place,” he said sarcastically.
“Why, Wallace Fennel, whatever do you mean? Of course, if a door or window should happen to be open...”
“Don’t jive me, I saw you put the bolt-cutters and the pry bar in the trunk.”
~
“I’d chop off my own arms for you. Well, one arm, because once I’ve chopped off that one I can’t really chop off the other.”
~ My pairing doesn’t require photoshop. (Also, Torchwood, where your pairing doesn’t require Photoshop).
~ “I like carrots. Carrots don’t talk. They don’t judge you, or natter away behind your back. They are entirely without opinion or malice.”
~ Her name was a groan, a sound of suppressed longing, of long months and years of unrequited love. It was the sound of a man breaking.
~ “I think you’d make a pretty princess,” a dark haired boy said quietly. Lois looked up sharply and he ducked his head.
~
“I cannot carry him by myself.” His eyes widened, and she realised he had not considered this. That somewhere in the back of his mind he had seen Will walking out of the castle with the rest of them. 
~ “I’m not firing a guy for watching the wrong football game.”
“Why not? I have.” 
“And when the paperwork alleging illegal dismissal comes across my desk, I’m going to pretend I never heard that.” 
~ It was then that the thought had come: Had he, in fact, sat on an invisible person? 
~ “You trust me, don’t you?”
Rose smiled nervously, “Oh, this is never good.”
~ “What are you talking about, you prissy sod? You have gone completely daft.”
~ “It was a zeppelin. Then outer space happened to it. Now it’s more of a conversation piece than anything.”
~ “You’re doing a lot of breathing for a dead woman.” He couldn’t stop his smile, “And I for one am remarkably grateful.”
~ “I should probably let you breathe, shouldn’t I?” the Doctor managed finally, voice rough with emotion, arms tight around her.
“Don’t you dare,” she said wetly, but there wasn’t much of a risk because he hadn’t moved in the slightest.
~ The Doctor cleared his throat, pitching his voice to “addressing huge powerful entity” volume. “Excuse me ...” No change.
“It’s a kid,” Rose said quietly. Right. He shifted his voice, a father telling a child to drop it this instant. “Excuse me!”
~
“You wanted a word. What was the word?”
“Sussex…I want Sussex. Your treaty won’t go through without me, and I want Sussex. And some of Somerset.”
~
He beamed proudly at that. “Manly” he reiterated, liking the word, and deciding that it suited him well.
~ He mentally added ‘Cleaning the Pterodactyl Nest’ to the ever increasing list of Punishment Duty, and slammed the door in their faces.
~ Much supposed that God had His reasons, His own means of distributing life’s strange adversities in this way; but he wished, just sometimes, that He might be a little fairer in doing so.
~ I know it’s not socially acceptable to test this out, but I’m reasonably sure that, while there are probably several more or less accurate ways to transliterate the sound made by an oar handle plunging into a man’s solar plexus, “PUNT!” is probably not one of them. I will allow that “UHHFF!!” is probably a pretty good approximation of the sound one would make when so oared, however.
~
“Long time lackey seeking situation as assistant to thuggish crime lord. Skills include simpering, dodging shoes and crockery thrown in anger, Microsoft Office. References: Unfortunately all in prison and/or incinerated.”
~ Apparently even Margo can’t stand to see it, as she’s covering her eyes rather than watch herself hand over the phone. Of course, it’s possible that she’s rigged the phone to detonate in Eric’s hand, and is just trying to keep from being blinded in the process.
~
“Are you okay? Did you hit your head, too?”
“Maybe,” I said. “I was unconscious before I hit the ground, so I don’t really remember.”
~ “McCoy said you fainted after your trial- “
“Passed-out,” I corrected. “I passed-out in a manly fashion.”
~
“He ate the rest of your cookies and peppered me with useless questions. It was rather like having a younger, louder version of you here.”
“I do not ask useless questions,” I objected. “My questions are always very thoughtful and full of purpose and deep reflection… And he’s not that much younger than me.” Bob raised an eyebrow. “Shut up.”
~
“She discharged herself against advisement, you know,” he informed me, in the same tone of voice you might use to say ‘she murdered that puppy, you know’.
~ “You look very solemn. Should I look solemn too?” He put on a serious face. 
~ I steered well clear of Kirmani, who I could see was attempting to be both Kirmani and Murphy and finding it an understandably difficult task. He had his cell phone to one ear, Murphy’s landline to the other and was snapping his fingers at someone to bring him a file. I didn’t want to throw myself into the middle of that and have him shoot me on sight.
~ “It is not intended to be useful. It is intended to challenge and expand the mind,” he intoned.
“Seems stupid to me,” I stated.
“Yes, Harry, and that is why your career as a wizard will consist of nothing more than a long list of items which you have blown-up.”
~ “Kira,” Daniel begins, as he motions for me to stop. “You’re not crazy.” He gives me a genuine ‘I’m serious here’ look.
“You know,” I begin. “I’d have an easier time believing that if I hadn’t attended your memorial service three weeks ago.”
Ghost-Daniel sighs and shakes his head in frustration. “I really thought they weren’t going to have one this time,” he mutters. “I distinctly remember having this conversation with Jack, and he assured me that if I ever died again, there would be no memorial unless he had a body.” He had this conversation with Jack? How morbid. Suddenly, it hits me.
“Died again!” Daniel just waves his hands absently.
“It’s a long story,” he begins. “Well, several long stories, actually...”
~ “Listen, it is entirely against the laws of nature that you put on that dress and don’t get to dance. Seriously. We’re talking hurricanes, earthquakes, maybe even zombies. Do you want to start a zombie uprising, Murphy?”
~ “You know our official policy when it comes to Azkaban?”
Percy hazarded a guess. “All is well and missing prisoners do not exist?”
~ He looked immeasurably relieved when Percy cleared his throat, assumed Super Pompous Prat mode, and said, “What can we do for you?”
~
“Oh bugger off, you lot,” Percy said, very rudely, to the flock of Dementors.
~
“…the hell? That’s a spoon! What do you think you’re going to do with that?” 
“No, stop that!” Percy shouted, vaunting with his spoon.
“Are you duelling me with a spoon?” he asked incredulously.
~
“The network is under constant surveillance so, er….”
“Oliver?” Oliver prompted, in an undertone.
“No, no! You need a code-name! It’s how they do it in the books.”
“Osric Tattington,” Oliver supplied, a bit too easily.
~ “She means that he bats with the other team’s Beaters,” hissed Harry out of the corner of his mouth.
“Since when has Dumbledore played Quid—oh.” He blanched visibly. “Bloody hell.”
~ He thought the conversation was getting needlessly tangential, and decided that the quickest way to remedy this was by speaking in capitals.
~ Susan: What is the energy of the HOMO and LUMO?
Marize: What is the energy of the glowing gay man?
~
Not even Batman had managed to get his hands on one of those phones yet. And, for the record, I officially hadn’t either. (If I was speaking unofficially and off the record, though, the phone looked great and worked even better.)
~ “I’d be worried about your mental health, but it wouldn’t make me stop loving you.”
“What if I became a serial killer?” she asked.
“I’d help you dispose of the bodies and provide a convincing alibi for you.”
“And what if I lost my nose in a horrific painting accident and had to wear a prosthetic one made of metal?”
~
“Yeah, but you’re not exactly the most perceptive guy on the planet, honey,” Maggie reminded him.
“I resent that,” Fitz said stoutly.
“Honestly, Will noticed that I had morning sickness before you did,” Maggie said, “and you live with me.”
~ “I want a duel.” That was a bit out of proportion for the insult he’d just given…
“Well, I would like an all-expenses paid trip to somewhere—anywhere—warm, Minerva insists on hoping for world peace, and I’m sure Umbridge wants us all consigned to Azkaban just on general principle, so I’m afraid it’s going to be a disappointing holiday all around.”
~
Rose told the story of how she first met the Doctor. Jack finished the story of how he almost destroyed the human race.
~
You could not have been an astronaut. You’re afraid of heights, speed, fire and small places.
~ Beg pardon, Lady Bradford, but my choice in a wife is really none of your affair. Even if she had been a pauper, she would have suited me far better than one of those prune-faced terriers you have the unmitigated gall to have named Prudence, Temperance and Chastity.
~ “Thanks for coming out here. It means a lot to me. On a friendship scale of one to ten, one being -”
“Casting spells on you without your permission?”
“Yeah, and ten being, flying all the way across the country to sit by my bedside while I’m sick. This is a nine, nine and a half.”
“Nine and a half?” Dawn shouted.
“Well, technically you didn’t fly across the whole country. You only flew in from Chicago.”
“So if I was attending Cal Tech instead of UIC, I’d get a full ten?”
Xander shrugged. “I don’t make the rules.”
“Yes, you do! You made them just now!”
~ Willow gave Angel a strange look. “We were two states over--” She closed her mouth with a snap. “We were in the neighborhood.” It would have been more convincing if Ellen hadn’t heard him kick Willow in the leg.
~
“You reside in the countryside,” stated the laconic voice, assured of its own astuteness. It was not a question, and my nod of acquiesce felt unnecessary and stupid.
~
“To the Ring of Hugging! That’s something you don’t say every day. You know, the atrium on Level 3 of the TARDIS is sort of round. Maybe I should rename that the Ring of Hugging. Then I could say it more often! Although not sure it’d be an every day thing as I just don’t need to go to the atrium that much.”
~
“I’ve formulated a brilliant plan of strolling back to the TARDIS. I mean, they’re blobs, Rose. You see how slow they move? And it’s not like they’re armed. Or legged!” He laughed at his own joke.
~
Dumbledore dealt with the situation as he dealt with all uncomfortable situations-- by projecting an aura of incredible intelligence that bordered on the condescending and by smiling.
~
“Fawkes, some Mozart if you please. As applicable as ‘the Flight of the Valkyries’ is to the situation, I fear that it adds a note of unnecessary terror to the proceedings.”
~
The others laughed knowingly, and he gathered from that comment that “Selesteri’s wine shop” was one of those where the dancing girls performed horizontally as well as vertically.
~ “Now, Donna, I didn’t overthrow anything. Humans, you always over exaggerate. I just lightly chastised them.”
“By burning down their senate!”
~ “Don’t get into too much trouble without me. Without supervision you’d probably summon the devil or start a World War or something.” He thought it best not to mention that he had already done both of those, and with supervision.

“You can add sugar and while it will mutate the transportation potion so that only your skin travels while the rest of you remains, at least it will have a pleasing taste.”
~ “I was reluctant to try a journalistic endeavour that didn’t involve writing, but I like it. Capturing moments, telling a story through images.”
“Acquiring blackmail,” Lois tossed in.

He blinked a few times. “I’m sure I’ll have something witty to say in response any moment now.”

“What do we have ready if we need to order a massive and undetectable rescue mission?”

She’s never been one for the rules and games of courting and Will, bless his soul, couldn’t woo a woman if he spent years practicing.

The Doctor was in a prison. This was a normal turn of events. He was often in prison. He had a tendency to annoy people in power who shouldn’t have power. One of the Doctor’s hobbies was to topple evil empires. The evil empire of the moment was called, ‘The Dark Domain’ with bolded font; typically camp and grandiose. The evil emperor was a flamboyant fellow who made people think things like ‘that Caligula guy wasn’t so bad’. Suffice it to say he and the Doctor did not get on. Well, that’s not true—they got along like a house on fire; Screams, flames, people running for safety. It took the Doctor exactly three hours to arrange a rebellion. Then he composed, on the fly, a twelve stanza sonnet in honour of the Emperor. It touched on the man’s utter vileness, lack of personal hygiene, pathetic love life and absent fashion sense (this poem would later be carved on the Emperor’s grave). When the guards came and pulled him out of the communications hub he could be heard exclaiming, “Was that rude? ‘Cause that’s me. Rude and not ginger.” He went on in this vein for some time before he was knocked unconscious.
~ You can’t see me from up there on your dais but, I’m rolling my eyes. All tyrants are frustrated drama queens at heart. Why couldn’t you have gone into theater? You already have the puffy shirts.
~ “You either had a flashback or were possessed by a homicidal maniac,” Alastor offered. “Not sure I’d care to wager which.”
~ Grog is only to be consumed either straight from the barrel, or from a mug heavy enough to to kill a man.

She looks at them uncertainly. “Is this going to be like a movie, where you rush me one at a time as I dispatch you with skill and a witty one-liner?” A dozen of the hooded figures move in on her. “Guess not.”
~ “Plan B, ask very nicely?”
“I’ll make up a batch of nitro-9 anyway, just in case we need a Plan C.”
~ “They’re nuns,” said Jake slowly, as if he were talking to a very small child. “You don’t beat up nuns unless you want to go to hell.”

Rose hadn’t expected to be getting lessons in escapology from Doctor Shaw’s lab assistant (whose main function in the laboratory seems to mostly be in passing Doctor Shaw things) but she was heartily glad of it.
~ “I like to shovel,” he says merrily. 
I snatch the shovel from him, and dig for a moment before hitting a human-sized, wooden box. I look at him. “Who’s in there?” 
“There’s nobody in there,” Jimmy says incredulously. “I would never—” A muffled, angry, frightened voice sounds from the box. I give Jimmy an expectant look. He sighs heavily, so put upon. “It…might be Nigel.”
~ “I’m not happy about the way things went, but…you were ambushed, and you did the best you could. However, in the future? I’d appreciate it if you didn’t let Jimmy light places on fire.” 
I grin. “Right. I’ll just have Jake blow them up.”

“We were trying to kick down the door,” Mickey said, offended, “And it would have worked too!.” 
Jake looked at them as if they were daft. “This is oak, mate, tough wood, only a bleedin’ axe can break down this door!”
~
Then I would love you in any way I could. And if we could not touch, then I would draw strength from your beauty. And if I went blind, then I would fill my soul with the sound of your voice and the contents of your thoughts until the last spark of my love for you lit the shabby darkness of my dying mind.
~
Rose waved her hand, and three green creatures appeared in a flash. “No, no,” she said, flustered, as Mickey tried not to laugh. “I don’t need you. I was just making a hand gesture!” The creatures moved away quietly, bowing as they went. “Clearly, you need to get me out of this,” Rose said, pleading with her eyes, not daring to move any part of her body again.

“It’s worse than Ikea instructions, even without the English translation. And all the diagrams are for people with tentacles.”

“Lindsay—everyone thought I was Cowardly Lion. And every single parent told me how freakin’ cute I was. They didn’t get the fact that I was supposed to be the Ferocious and Deadly Lion. It was the most disastrous Halloween ever.” “Which only made things worse when you tried to tell them this, and they went crazy over the fact that you couldn’t say ‘ferocious.’”
~
No one, in all his years, has ever referred to him as a “very nice young man.” He decides not to correct her with stories of how he’s slaughtered zombies beside his father or watched a chupacabra eat a dog alive while his brother crept close enough for the kill.
~
“But about as close as I can explain. And hey, the good news is… I’m not crazy.”
“And the bad news?”
“I’m not crazy.”
Tony let the meaning sink in for a minute before responding. “How not crazy?” he asked carefully.
~
“So who are we today? Do you want to be FBI or ATF?”
“Put those away,” he grumbled, trying to hide his friend’s felony from the police that seemed to be swarming all over the place. 
~ “You’re too young to be Dean,” he finally muttered. “And you’re missing the scar he has at his hairline.”
Alec sighed. “Stay with me – I. Am. Not. Your. Son.
~
“Werewolves don’t kidnap children,” says Sam, almost involuntarily.
Dean shakes his head and replies, “Nah, there was that one case in Kentucky—remember? That kooky family that used to snatch kids from the playground so they could create their own werewolf pups? Crazy fucking people.”

“For some reason, I don’t process alcohol as well as I did when we were youthful sprites blessed with ridiculously hardy livers.”

“Maybe they’ll send you an owl saying ‘We have been watching you, we know where you live’.”

‘Quack’ said the duck to Bob, by way of explanation. ‘Quack-quack.’
“You cannot keep it,” Bob declared. “We have no room for a duck.”
“I don’t want to keep it, Bob, I’m not four,” I said.
~ It wasn’t until Kirmani’s shadow started to move independently of him that I was confident black magic was afoot.
~ “Do you mind focusing on the people trying to kill us?” 
“Ah, but that is part of my charm,” Ramirez said, loosing another volley. “I can multitask.” 
“Impressive—FUEGO!—I bet you can even walk and chew gum at the same time.” 
“I have trophies.”

“Upon approaching the subject for questioning he...” she struggled for words. “Turned into a bat thing and tried to eat your face?” I suggested. “Resisted arrest and in the ensuing confrontation, was -” “- killed by a bullet from Detective Kirmani’s gun,” I filled in. “No, but I don’t think we can say Dresden staked him through the heart, either,” I pointed out.
~ “That skull is hitting on me,” Rose told the men next to her, incredulously.
“Everything that’s happened today and you’re really that surprised we’ve met a talking skull?”
~ “We just haven’t shot it enough,” Jack objected. “You shoot anything enough, it has an effect.” “I know a cop you’d like,” I said. “Actually, remind me never to introduce you to her.”
~ “How is it fair that they’re trying to invade on Christmas!” He was a single octave away from whining, he walked a very fine line.
~ By the end of the day, Harry had a working list of suspects and motives – anyone and everyone who could and maybe would do something like this. Gods, demons, faeries (up to and including the Queens), wizards summoning gods or demons, wizards who wanted to take over the city or to keep other people out, wizards with other, ineffable motives… It wasn’t a short list. Unfortunately, other people had lists, too, and Harry himself was at the top of theirs.

The Doctor reaches down and a large stack of cards materializes in his hand. The first one says I can’t get the sound to work. He lets the card slide down to the ground, disappearing at his feet, and the next card reads A T-rex tried to eat the TARDIS. Always a simple explanation for a complicated situation. But Rose doesn’t care. The fact that he’s made the effort is enough for her. He drops the card to show the next one. With any luck, by next year I’ll be traveling with one of these people. The next card revealed pictures of Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and for some reason, Lily Allen. But for now, let me say, without hope or agenda, and because it’s Christmas (and at Christmas, you tell the truth... Written in smaller script near the bottom of the card was ...mostly, but really, sometimes it’s just easier to tell people that I’m the reincarnation of their river god.) Rose grins at this, remembering that trip. The cards continued: to me, you are perfect. Everything in Rose melts at this point. Tears fall, but she does her best to not make a sound. And my wasted hearts will love you until you look like this. The card falls to reveal a picture of the Face of Boe. Rose bites her lip and tries not to laugh, in spite of wanting to cry hysterically.

“Samuel Winchester, you stop this right now.” “Doesn’t even work for Dad.” “Samantha?” “Deanna.” Dean looks faintly revolted
~
“In the hut.” Dean sounds doubtful, the brusque tone forgotten as he tests the words for small print like ‘with the zombie horde’
~ It turns out that a concussion makes John Winchester much more likely to forgive an unlocked car door and Sam files this away under ‘useful information’ just on the outside chance it will come in handy.
~ He doesn’t seem to remember the stolen car and, for once in full and unspoken agreement, Sam and Dean choose not to bring it up.
~ “Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, you know.” “At least it’s wit, what’ve you got?”
~ Then they’re both looking back toward the bar, lifting their heads the same way I’ve seen batches of whitetail deer do it, all synchronized grace and muted alarm. Sam rolls up off my hood without using his hands, working on nonchalance because two guys have come outside. My boys don’t say another word but Sam is getting in the passenger side with an ease he never reaches when getting out, and Dean runs a hand along my hood and up my weather stripping as he walks around and slides in.
~ He knows about making yourself and the victims human to the perp, and he’s working hard at that because tonight he’s wearing both hats.
~ In their youth, they had learned to avoid hospitals however possible, but they’d also learned that when they did go to see a real doctor their lies had to be flawless. Broken bones had to be able to be explained exactly, but without too much detail. Cuts, bruises should never be linked to another person because that inevitably led to questions about parents, led to social workers or psychologists. Any wound could never, ever be self inflicted in fiction.
~
The younger of the two beams a smile which fails to distract her from the fact he carefully, and subtly, angles the laptop so she can’t see. The older grins at her words and she can practically *see* what he’s thinking (she’s totally not that limber) and he should be glad he’s hot.
~
“If prescient means lame, then yes,” said Dean, shovelling another bite of food into his mouth. Sam kicked him under the table. “He’s asking if I can sense things before they happen, ass.” “Then why didn’t he just say that?” “I know it’s difficult for you to understand, but some people have this special gift known as a ‘vocabulary.’”
~
“Ixnay on the isionsvay,” Dean whispered. “Wow. How on earth did you ever come up with that ingenious code, Dean? No one could possibly understand what you just said.”
~ “You’re such an asshole sometimes. He’s not going to try and destroy me.” “How do you know?” “I’m psychic, remember?”
~ “There’s nothing to control.” “Right. Hi, I’m Sam Winchester, I’m totally normal except for how I light things on fire with my mind.” “That could have been an electrical short.” “It wasn’t an electrical short and you know it. I was pissed and I set a lamp on fire.” “It was an ugly lamp, anyway. It deserved to die.”
~
“Guy wearing a full suit of armour just showed up at your front door with a feeling that you needed help. I think that means it’s time.”
~
“A magic sword of the righteous used to fight evil?” Sam asked. “Dean, if you turn that down you will be the stupidest bastard ever to walk the face of the earth. Fighting evil is what we do. Why the hell would you want to give up a weapon like that?”
~ So they’re stuck in a leaky cave in Virginia in January, with nothing but half a bag of trail mix (Sam), a third of a Snicker’s bar (Dean - “It’s practically the same thing as trail mix, except with creamy nougat. Who doesn’t like creamy nougat?”), and assorted weaponry (shared).
~
“Tell me you did not find those in this cave.” “No, Sam, I did not find these marshmallows in this cave. I created them with my brain. You’re not the only one with freaky powers; mine just happens to be more practical than yours. And tastier.”
~
Enter Sandman pt. II: Electric Boogaloo. An ode to Metallica which will never be released, for legal reasons. (The reason being, of course, that no matter how much they *wanted* to sign the paperwork, Lars Ulrich never stopped laughing long enough when presented with the contract to be able to produce a legible signature.)
~ Dad was not pleased, as the smell of burning hair does not come easily out of leather. Nor was Sam, having to start the sixth grade with a buzz cut, making his eyes even more enormous and Disneylike. Which, if you’re Dean (and Dean is), is pronounced “girly.”
~
Sam would just like you to know that when a can of hairstyling product says “Caution: flammable,” they really, really mean it. From, like, three feet away. Dean would like you to know that that sort of thing only happens when you use a) the cheap stuff and 2) enough of it to shellack an elephant. Also, one would think that, in this business, one would learn to read labels. Sam would like you to know that he is punching Dean now.
~
Okay, the third time really wasn’t an accident. But Sam will never know. Dean doesn’t like to talk about the fourth time. It makes him scowl and rub protectively at his own eyebrows.
~
I leave you alone for a couple of days, and you end up tied to a tree. As a sacrifice. A tree, Dean. And not even a very big tree. Kind of a decorative bush-tree.
~
They’re discussing gross vegetables. For future reference, we will no longer be serving arugula.
~
There were a lot of hollow death threats and something about his legions vs. someone else’s legions at dawn, Greenwich mean time. Then there was a small riot, but there was nothing to loot, and trying to set the place on fire was redundant, so the crowd finally dispersed.
~ Wish you were here. By the way, Sam is possessed, so shoot him if you see him. Oh, and Dean is a jerk – shoot him too.
~ “You have to cut their heads off. Is it too much to hope that you guys have scalpels the size of machetes around here somewhere?” 
“They’re on backorder,” JD said, rubbing at his throat, fingers coming away bloody. 
~ He slammed into the facing wall at the bottom and had second thoughts about being a bounty hunter, because obviously there was a lot of wall slamming involved and it got old very quickly. Also, there were vampires.
~
When the Winchester patriarch finally did make it home, it was to find Sam cuffed to the railings of the porch shouting taunts at his older brother, who was knee-deep in the neglected flower-bed, wielding a shovel and inventing new swear words with every other breath as he dug for his buried tape box.
~
Sam’s little mouth made a silent O and he squeezed both eyes shut quickly and then opened them again, which was the only version of a wink he could manage, despite Dean’s diligent training on the art form.
~
“See! You even know the name for possessed chickens! Who knows the name for possessed chickens? No, you see, here’s the plan: you stay out there with your war against the lokhas, and I’ll just hang in here for awhile before you decide to use me as bait for a demonic turtle or something.” There’s a long pause before Dean finally says, “Sam? Aren’t you going to tell me the official name for a demonic turtle?”
~
“He won’t join your army.” Sam leaves out the ‘you crazy bitch’, but knows she hears it.
~
“Blow it up? Sure, why not? Get up to it, super-glue the grenade somewhere vital, use a string to pull the pin, and run like hell. House is condemned anyway, and nothing’s immune to a grenade or two.”… “I can’t believe these freakin’ things are immune to grenades,” Dean muttered, opening another door and scanning quickly with the flashlight. “Quanta-whatsis-lock stupid bastard freaking angels.”
~
Sam tilted his head in the way that he’d been doing since forever, and Dean had long since realized that when Sam did that, tilted his head like that and focused his eyes just so, he was about to say something and be right about it, too. Damn him.
~
It wasn’t Dean’s something’s-here-to-murder-us-horrifically-in-our-sleep-so-anytime-you’d-like-to-help-Sam shout, so he didn’t scramble for a weapon or fling himself off the bed.
~
“If I really wanted to get laid, I could. Easy. Dean Winchester, Ghost Hunter. How often do we get to use that line?”
Sam coughed in a way that sounded suspiciously like ‘cocktail waitress, Tulsa, November of ‘99,’ as he grabbed his own plate.
“I’m not even going to ask how you remembered that, freak boy.”
~
“Big miscommunication in gym class. I assure you, it’s slander. A misrepresentation of events,” Dean said, smiling brilliantly.
“Coach says you purposely hit Mr. Brad Renshaw in the face with a football.”
“Did not. It slipped. And even then, he should’ve caught it, what with him being Mr. Star Running Back of the team,” Dean protested.
~
“What makes you think I’m considering doing anything besides going to…” Dean glanced down at a ragged slip of white paper with his schedule on it. “Classic lit?”
“Could be because it’s halfway through the semester and you still don’t know what classes you’re taking.”
~ “I hate California,” Dean grumbled, stabbing randomly at his cafeteria food. “This no season crap is really boring. We need snow.”
“I thought you hated snow. You know, ever since that car accident last year.”
“No, I hate ice because of that. Snow is still good,” Dean corrected. “Of course, after four months of staring at a landscape that looks suspiciously like every backdrop of a post-apocalyptic movie, anything would be better. Including the apocalypse.”
~
“No, you’re bad,” Sam assured him. “Just in the delinquent way, not the scary one.”
“I’ll take what I can get at this rate,” Brian grumbled. “Your brother has taken almost every reputation. The Hot New Guy, The Bad Guy, The Tough Guy, the Hot Car Guy, The Strong Silent Guy, the Brooding Guy…” 
~
“What the fuck is that?” Brad asked, too stupid to recognize a gunshot when he heard one.
“Winchester SXR,” Sam and Dean automatically answered.
~ “How the hell would I know?” Dean growled. “Judging by the gun, I’d say he wants to shoot someone.”
“Isn’t there supposed to be some type of security in the building?” Brad said.
“It’s called Pete, and he’s probably down at the lounge stealing coffee.” 
~
“Sammy, stay here. Someone will need to give me a decent eulogy, and we know it won’t be Dad.”
~ “I was having a bad dream,” Rae tried again. “It was about lots of people in their underwear watching my history presentation.”
Her bed shifted again as Dad sat back down. “Sounds disturbing. I’ll have to talk to Sam about his advice on public speaking.”
~ “You get all the juicy details from Uncle Sam’s date?”
Dad snorted. “Nothing juicy there. Your uncle is an idiot.”
~
“Next thing you know, she’s going to want to go on a date. A real date, no chaperones. I can’t do this.”
“It’s okay, Dean. I’ll try to find something for you to kill, make you feel better.”
~ He tried shoving his wallet back in his pocket, but could not seem to locate the pocket. “Sam? Where’d my pocket go? Somebody take it?”
Sam sighed, standing. He took the wallet from his brother and stuck it in Dean’s back pocket. “Found it.”
Dean grabbed him by the shoulders. “You’re a good brother, you know that?”
Sam shook his head, taking one of Dean’s arms to lead him out. “You’re drugged out of your gourd, you know that?”
~ “Well, I’m not going to believe your eyewitness if she’s female.”
~ And the reports made by witnesses Luke Skywalker and Han Solo set off a whole set of alarms. How had those aliases gotten past anyone?
~ He thought the answer to that was yes, but to tell the truth, he was having problems with logical thought just now, so he could be wrong.
Speaking of dying – he had been speaking of dying, hadn’t he? He thought so, but … Anyway. He was speaking of it now, by God, and it was sounding pretty good.
~ The thing inside him moved his arm up, swinging it in an arc that Victor had learned to associate with people flying into walls.
~ Sam stumbles against the table to the left of the door, turns the stumble into a smooth pivot and suddenly his left arm is around the neck of the thug seated there and his right hand is pressing a gun to the thug’s temple. He hisses something in the man’s ear and the man lets the gun he himself has been holding under the table clatter to the floor. Simultaneously, Dean has re-appeared from the hallway, locked down the second thug and appropriated his gun before he has a chance to react to his compatriot’s peril. He exchanges a look with Sam, a question posed and answered silently.
~ “Flying butt dresses!” a dark-haired boy yelled, and promptly fell over laughing. The conversation quickly disintegrated into accusations of “you’re a flying butt dress” and “your mom wears flying butt dresses.”
~ “It’s a damn good fort, boys.” They were impressed with the inclusion of a curse word to describe the appreciation of all their hard work.
~
“No, c’mon! My life cannot be this unfair!” Dean took a few steps closer to her. “You can’t be the bad guy, you were too…” he trailed off making curvy motions with his hands. “Aw man,” he sighed. “Are you sure you’re one of the bad guys?”
“I think the claws and spiked back and, you know, the fact that she’s eating someone gives it away, Dean!” Sam answered for her.
~ Dean saw one swing towards him, but could only think “Aw, man, tentacles too?” before he found himself flung off his feet.
~ Sam turned to Dean, looking stunned. “Are you telling me you spent two weeks staring at this necklace and you never suspected her?”
Dean frowned, thinking back. “You know that does explain the spider. Don’t these symbols need insect blood to remain active? The spider must have escaped. Well, whaddaya know.”
Sam continued to stare at Dean. “That’s it, Dean. I’ve decided, from now on, everything’s your fault!”
~
“Dude, I’m covered in my lust lady’s insides and I just watched a very big, scary, tattooed man get teary seeing you go. Weird doesn’t even begin to cover this hunt.”
~
“Do you even have a flashlight?” the other boy challenged. Dean looked at him like he was nuts and then shone his light directly in Frank’s face. “Do I look like some friggin’ amateur or something? Of course I have a flashlight!”
~ “Biff?” Dean cut in with a snort. “You actually know someone named ‘Biff’?” He started to laugh.
~
Sam tried to hide the knife, and succeeded in jabbing himself in the finger with it. Dean gave him a disbelieving look and snatched it from him, bringing Laura’s attention back to the knife.
~ ‘What the hell?’ Dean thought as he chased the moving shape through the master bedroom and it pretty much just threw itself out a window. Pausing only long enough to be sure he wasn’t about to jump to his death, Dean followed suit, cursing just about everything he could think of as his feet slipped before finding purchase on the roof outside the window. “I hate heights,” he growled. “I hate old houses. I hate old Victorian houses. I hate -” his litany of dislikes kept him occupied as he slipped and slid his way after the intruder.
~
“Yet?” Dean scowled but the look was wasted in the blackness. “What do you mean ‘yet’? I thought you had a plan. You gave me the ‘don’t do anything stupid I’ve got a plan look’.” He didn’t’ need to see Frank to know the incredulous look the sleuth shot him.
“What the- I did not! I don’t even know what that look is!”
~
“My dad told me not to talk to strangers.” They’d moved on to the mocking stage. Bypassed the ‘you can’t make me’ and landed knee deep in the ‘I’d like to see you try’.
~
“You going to keep quiet and let me tell you what I think about your family?”
“Depends,” Dean smirked nastily, “you gonna keep quiet and let me tell you where to shove it when you’re done?”
~
“Whoever made a mess of your face is going to find themselves very uncomfortable. Your father plans to beat them to death with his cast.” David wondered if the man would accept any help in the matter. He had a perfectly good baseball bat that probably wouldn’t miss…
~
“Of course it isn’t a bad idea. It was my idea, ergo it must, by definition, be the byproduct of my genius.”
~ “Besides, I don’t seem to remember you putting up much of a protest when I suggested it.”
Dean obviously had a selective memory. “Dude, I handcuffed you to the closet.”
“Exactly.” Dean grinned inanely. “If you’d really wanted to stop me, you’d have just gone straight for the chloroform.”
~
“Morning.” Sam obviously saw nothing unusual in his father destroying kitchen appliances before the morning news, and breezed cheerily to the Lucky Charms.
~
“Can I go out tonight? The guys from Shop are having a post ‘we-built-a-car-and-it-didn’t-explode’ party.
~
Oh god. The damsel in distress. John didn’t need to know that it had been a woman in trouble. When Dean landed himself in shit like this, there was always a woman involved. Two, this time. Sampson. Continuing his story, blissfully unaware of his father’s plans to have him join the Church and remain chaste for life, Dean pulled a face.
~ “You scared him away?”
“Something like that.” The inflection was dark and cold. He wondered if he’d have to spend the weekend burying a body.
~ Dean Winchester was a sadistic bastard. Sam wanted that underlined, printed in bold, and possibly highlighted by a flashing neon border. Along with the note that if God had intended humankind to spend several hours up to their eyes in mud, he’d have given them considerably thicker skin. Either one of those points would be welcome on his tombstone.
~ Sam, when mom and dad brought you back from the hospital, I told them to trade you for a baseball. I stand by that.
~
“Cheese burger, fries.”
“Something green?” Sam grimaced at her, and she grinned.
“Lime jello?” he suggested. She stared at him. “Fine. Green beans.”
~
“It’s OK with me if it’s…”
“Go check…” Jacob ordered his brother even as he tore around the hood of the truck.
“I’ll go!” Tommy shouted over Jacob’s instructions, making a dash for the back door.
~
From the half-hearted smirk on Dean’s face, Jo suspected that she was about to get a smart-ass response as to how he’d gotten shot—well, there’s this thing called a gun—but the expression on her own face seemed to stop him.
~
“Just so we’re clear; if you hurt her or the boys, Sam and I will kill you.”
“Understood. You’ll have to get in line, though. I think yours is the fifth death threat I’ve had.”
~
“How is it you didn’t strangle me when I was going through that phase?” he asked conversationally.
“I actually suggested drowning you a couple of times. But you know Dad. All, ‘How’s he going to learn, if he’s dead, Dean?’”
~
“Not even a black eye,” he’d mumbled. “Nobody’s going to believe I was there.” Disgruntled.
“I’ll hit you,” Michael grinned, almost serious, mostly sympathetic.
~ The boy stomped toward Tommy, who was dancing in terrified glee around Luke, trying to keep the bulky man between himself and his brother.
~
Luke scratched the back of his head, squinting at her. “We blew up the cave.” There was a stunned silence.
“You what?” Jo asked incredulously. The men looked slightly guilty for a second before huge, self-satisfied grins blossomed on their faces.
~
“Dean gave me that talk a few times already. Updated it as he you know... found out more.”
~
Injuries on a normal person appear gruesome and agonizingly painful. Injuries on one Dean Winchester ran together like a watercolor painting, somehow enhancing the beauty and mystery continually cloaking his figure, and appearing as effortless as an accessory that one might carry, such as a handbag.
~
“Well, the freakin’ foot-high, bright pink ‘DO NOT TOUCH’ might’ve been a clue that something bad would happen if you touched it.”
~
“You got me a tie?”
“You like ties.”
Wilson studied it. “Wait. This is the tie I gave you.”
“That’s how I knew you’d like it.”
“Not just the same style of tie but the exact same tie.” He loosely folded the tie, then picked up the bag. “It’s even the same bag.”
~
“I lost a bet.” He unzipped his coat. “Did you knows that ears of corn always have an even number of rows?”
“He’s making random bets on vegetables?”
~ “See, all that crap in the parenting books you’re supposed to tell your kids? This is what it gets you. My son wants to be a radioactive lizard, and my daughter wants to be a Johnny Depp role.”
~
A new voice broke the tension with a derisive snort. “‘Enter if you dare’? You’ve gotta be kidding me.”
~
Of course, the highlight of the entire evening was Alastor opening his gift—with his wand and from a distance of nearly two meters after casting several hex- and curse-detection spells on it which Severus supposed was what you got for giving a paranoid lunatic a wrapped present even if he could see through the paper
~
“What did you get me? It’s not a cat is it?” Xander gave him a suddenly wary glance. “Because whatever the girls said, they’re lying.”
~
If I loved you, then I would love you in any way I could. And if we could not touch then I would draw strength from your beauty and if I went blind then I would fill my soul with the sound of your voice and the contents of your thoughts until the last spark of my love for you lit the shabby darkness of my dying mind.

CROWLEY, said Freddie Mercury with an air of vague irritation, YOU’RE LATE ON YOUR REPORT. Dean looked at the tape warily as if it were going to bite him. YOU WILL SUFFER MIGHTILY, CROWLEY. YOU WILL BURN IN FLAMES OF AGONY AND -  “Who the fuck are you?” Dean interrupted irritably.
~
When Shawn grabs onto Dean’s jacket tightly and presses his face into Dean’s neck, Dean crosses seizure off his list. He adds psychopath, circles it and underlines it three times. That’s all the list he needs.
~
“You bugged me.”  
You make a thriving business out of inspecting your nails. “I might’ve done a lot of things.” “You bugged me,” but his cheeks are full from grinning and it’s spreading, your own mouth shifting, losing the battle in haste.
~
“Nobody’s shooting anybody,” Danny stated, giving Dean a look. “You two don’t know each other that well, do you?” Bela replied, glancing back and forth between them.
~
“Then why are you here?” “To shoot the people you tell me to shoot, sir. And occasionally to blow shit up.”
“I see. And do you care where, exactly, you do those things?” “No, sir.” Dean had never seen a general grin before.
~
“It might be worth peeling potatoes for a month to get away from you.” “Oh, I think you’re underestimating Lorne. It’ll be for a hell of a lot longer than a month, and I’ll be right next to you the whole time.”
~ Ronon gave him a knife, which was the norm. Ronon gave him knives for every holiday in which gifts were given. He’d even got one for Hanukkah even though he’d explained that he wasn’t Jewish.
~
Jack blinks at him because he didn’t realise they were negotiating, but apparently, there it is. 
~
One of the perks of being a General is Jack can have ideas and just run with them without having to run them through any kind of approval process. At least, that’s what he keeps doing. He’s got some underlings who constantly look harassed and would like to inform him that this isn’t particularly true.
~ Dean reaches across the table to the plate of muffins that are in the center and proceeds to eat only the tops of five before he brushes off his hands and nods. “Proceed,” he invites, managing to sound magnanimous.
~ Dean makes a show of looking through her resume but isn’t too sure what he’s supposed to see. He’s never actually hired anyone before and he can’t tell whether the three pages on electric blue paper and smelling faintly of flowers is what he should be expecting.
~
“If by evil you mean head spinning, pea soup spewing? Then no,” Cordelia confirms. “Wait, you worked for an angel?”
~
Cordelia grins in a way Dean recognises. It’s the ice-cream for breakfast grin that Sam had tried on him when he was seven.
~
“Apparently, we’ve become the dumping ground for weird alien crap.” “His name is Ronon,” Sam corrects from his perch on Cordelia’s desk, a file open in his lap.  “He’s a guy with a tracking device embedded in his spine who is being chased by space vampires,” Dean adds, crossing his arms and furrowing his brow. “I only just got used to the whole vampire thing. Now I gotta add space to it?” “I’m sorry, was this an actual meeting or did you just want to vent?”
~
One hundred years plus of immortality have taught you what a lynch mob looks like. Once you’ve been buried alive, you learn to pay close attention whenever anyone starts shouting about abominations.
~
“…Of course, there was that one time in college.” “Hands up if you want to hear that story.” Four hands went up, and he stared accusingly at Monica. She shrugged. “I already know the story.”
~
He gives her a look, and she can tell he’s wondering if “I own an inn” is a euphemism.
~
Dean Winchester was in this office just as much as Principal Larry Schaffer was in this office. And it was his frickin’ office. God, this little demon was going make Larry pick up the bottle again. He had been sober for a good two years, seven months, and fourteen days. Larry had pulled out his calendar to count because of Dean Winchester.
~
“Mosquitoes.” Sam looked at Dean quite matter-of-factly. “They have forty-seven teeth. And a baby kangaroo? That’s called a joey.” “Fantastic. I can die happy knowing that.” “Welcome!” Sam exclaimed brightly. “And, Dean? A bumblebee? It has five eyes.” Just because Dean didn’t allow other people to beat up Sam didn’t mean that he couldn’t.
~ “Hello,” said the tiny voice on the other line. “Is your refrigerator running? If it is, you’d better catch it!” The little voice erupted into peals of laughter, as another voice could be heard saying, “Sam, you are such an idiot. You can’t prank call someone who calls you.”
~ Sam sat on the floor as he coloured another picture for Daddy. He had been angry when Dean had told him that Daddy wouldn’t be coming home for Christmas, but Dean had explained about how a shape shifter had impersonated Comet and how Daddy was riding with Santa this year, just to make sure that nothing bad happened. His daddy had to save the day, again. Sam knew that his dad could do anything, and he understood that he couldn’t be selfish. He also understood that if the shifter killed Santa, he wouldn’t get the really awesome action figure he wanted. Dean had helped him write five letters to Santa, carefully detailing the toy. Sam wanted to make sure to get that toy. It was only the very bestest toy in the entire world.
~
“You do realize if they kill us, turn us into zombies, whatever...this will be the most humiliating death in history. Cheerleaders!”
~ “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” he asks as they head out on Montauk Highway. “I think so, Brain, but lederhosen make my calves look fat,”
~
“Words cannot express how I feel about you. Stand by for rude gestures.”
~
“I don’t like it when you sound like that. I end up in handcuffs every time you sound like that.” “Hey, do you really think I’d get you arrested at a time like this?” “If my birthday were on Christmas and I decided to get married at noon, I think you could have me in a jail cell at eleven fifty-five.”
~
Walter Braintree knows a guy who can get you a thousand pounds of heavy explosives without batting an eyelash and hasn’t asked Walter for a single thing in return for ages, which is why Walter parks in the middle of the darkened drive-in on the outskirts of the city and waits.
~ The dozen different ways he can think of to disarm her run through his mind and only five of them don’t involve breaking a bone.
~
So he’s in this warehouse in Pennsylvania, right, trying not to get caught by the deceased and rather pissed-off janitor haunting the fucking place, and his cell phone rings in his pocket. He thought he’d turned it off but apparently everything on this goddamn job is going to go wrong, which is exactly what he’s thinking when he flips open his phone to stop the ringing and hears DJ whisper, “Uncle Dean, duck!” When John Winchester raises you, you hear “Duck!” and don’t even think about the why. You just do. Dean drops like a stone, as if a heavy hook on a rusted chain’s really going to do everlasting damage anymore when swung at his head. 
~ Sam can’t remember a time Will has ever woken up before nightfall on a Sunday. It’s possible he’s in a coma, but Sam can’t summon forth the energy to check.
~ She looks exactly like one of the Olsen twins, if they were both stuck on a deserted island, one had to eat the other one to live and the surviving twin ballooned up to the weight of a normal girl.
~ Hunting a werewolf pack is not really as hard as you’d think. You just have to make sure you have guns and silver bullets, and after that it’s just like any other hunt, except if you go hunting whitetail and make a wrong move, you don’t turn into Bambi.
~ They don’t see Robin that morning. They do, however, find all four tires on the Impala leaking air. So it’s probably a good thing that they don’t see Robin that morning, because Dean probably would have throttled her.
~ There’s certain things you just don’t expect to come barreling at you as you enter a werewolf’s den. The short list includes elephants, banana cream pies, the Dallas Cowboys, a cement mixer, and a tidal wave of molasses. Most of those will come as a great shock and perhaps throw you so completely off your guard as to render you incapacitated when the werewolves finally do attack. Come to think of it, it’s a wonder more werewolf dens don’t have more security systems that look like that.
~ Sam would say something, but when you’re grinning like an idiot to keep from laughing like a lunatic, speaking comes in a distant third.
~ She’s pretty sure if you dropped him off in the middle of the desert with a Swiss Army knife and a prayer, he’d find his way back to civilization in two hours with a water bottle made out of a cactus and eating a hot dog he made out of rattlesnake meat along the way.
~ Look, it’s not like they’ve never switched bodies before. In fact, Sam and Dean have switched bodies with one another seven times, once for two straight months. Dean’s been turned into a baby, Sam’s been turned into an old man, and they’ve both been turned into girls a grand total of twenty-one times. Sam’s been turned into a hamster, a dragon, a yak, a block of mozzarella cheese and a pile of dung beetles thanks to a younger Dean’s unfortunate attempt to get himself a puppy and rid himself of a little brother at the same time. Dean’s been turned into a donkey, a rocking chair, a chimpanzee, two tickets to a Knicks-Lakers game and an Australian complete with the accent and a strange new craving for Vegemite.
~ Also, they play Dean and Sam on some TV show. If you think that throws Dean and Sam at all, then you’ve obviously missed out on the three times they had tails, the six times they had wings, the two times they had horns, and that one time Sam woke up covered from head to toe in bright pink monkey hair that was too thick to shave or cut and took a week to shed off.
~
They’d come up with some bullshit story if they had to, he said, something about carpal tunnel if he wasn’t that late, something about hookers and coke and the questionable presence of a monkey in a diaper if he was.
~ It’s hilarious when Kate or Alice or any of the other women she knows ask her what her exercise secret is. Mary knows “Last week, John and I ran at breakneck speeds for a mile and a half to escape a werewolf” wouldn’t go over so well, but that doesn’t stop her from being horribly tempted to say it to them anyway.
~ “So do you have a name, or should I just call you She Who Inhales Her Breakfast?”
~ Beth had a boyfriend who’d been eaten, a mother who’d been eaten, a pet Labrador that had been eaten, and a very nice neighbour lady who’d been the one that ate them all.
~ “If she made it through the first time, what’s to say she couldn’t the second time?” “We’re not talking about a mine field here. We’re talking about a zombie horde.”
~
John’s almost a professional when it comes to liquor and “connisseur” sounds a hell of a lot better than “alcoholic” any day of the week.
~ He is not Jake Peterson, and he didn’t fuck the quarterback’s girlfriend. He’s never even met the quarterback’s girlfriend, and if the quarterback is any indication, he wouldn’t go near her without some serious body armour and disinfectant. So when he says he’s not sorry for sleeping with the quarterback’s girlfriend, it’s because he wasn’t stupid enough to touch her in the first place.
~ Fairy tale. A noun. A story you tell children to make them believe there can be a happily-ever-after when a witch tried to eat you or a spell kept you in a goddamn coma for a hundred years. See also: Lie.
Sacrifice. Noun. The act of giving up something or someone very important for the benefit of someone else. Permission from everyone involved not required. Feeling like a real asshole and wallowing in guilt afterwards optional.

Perform. A verb. To show off a skill or talent before a select audience in an attempt to get them to give you a cookie.
Courage. A noun. Standing in front of a big monster with blood-stained teeth, having only a book of matches and muttered prayer for protection, and being too stupid to run in the opposite direction. 
Pawn. A noun. A chess piece. Also, a noun. What you are when someone gets you to do certain things for some sort of fucked-up master plan. Also, a verb. When someone gets rid of something valuable to them by giving it to someone who royally shafts them in return.
~ His brow furrows and he concentrates once again. He’s starting to feel like the bad guy in that Superman movie, the one who’d narrow his eyes at something and grunt and come up with nothing in the lasers-from-the-eyes department. He gives the spoon another dirty look and thinks about how bad that last Superman sequel was. Nope, still nothing. “Have you tried saying ‘There is no spoon’ yet?” Sam sighs and closes his eyes before saying, “Dean, stop helping.”
~ “Are we… allowed to know that?” Willow asked. “No, and if you let anyone know I told you, I could go to jail, so do me a favor and keep your mouths shut.”
~
“Planes are no fun and the other passengers get weirded out when we start talking about dismemberment and viscera.” “Which probably happens more often than you might think, sir,” Riley put in.
~
“You know, you’ve got the same name as…” she trailed off as she got a better look at him as he sat next to her. “Or you actually are him.”
~
“Don’t take this personally or anything, but I’m not saying a damn thing until I see what’s on your surveillance tapes, cause I like my reputation for being the sane one. “
~ “Pah, try to arrest me for this and I’ll turn you into…” she eyed Benson a moment then continued, “…a badger. Yes, I think so. A badger.
~ “You can’t end a sentence like that without an evil laugh. Bwa-ha-ha. Now, you try it…”
~
“Your piece of paper allows you to search the building, you grotty little man. It does not give you right to bully children and I assure you your superiors, which I imagine includes most of the mammals in the western hemisphere, and not a few of the reptiles, will be hearing a detailed list of your petty brutalities….” ~ “I rep you no partee, my friend. You know how this ends, you make big plans and get all threat-happy and doom-talking, and then the slayer kicks ass, you RIP and we party. Same old, same old. Or we could skip all that, you surrender and we go for pizza. It’d be different. You could really break the mould here.”
~
“Enough! You think you can just come into to our….” and then his forehead sprouted a dagger, his chest developed a sudden stake infection and he stumbled and fell over and Carla felt iron fingers gripping the back of her neck, which was totally unnecessary because she hadn’t even thought of running, while the slayer’s other hand waved a sword in lazy circle eights.
~
“I’m thinking it’s not a croc and it’s the world’s biggest pet newt…but then I’m prone to unfounded optimism.”
~
“Please don’t run over the nice paper boy.” Dawn pleads. 
She swerves back onto the road. “Oh, I missed him by a foot at least.” “He had to dive off his bike.” Dawn says slowly. “He was just being dramatic.”
~
“Eight bloody hours.” Giles glares at them. “Eight bloody hours of silence and you two watching like bloody hawks and you talk to her?”
~
“But dad’s back on that ‘Giles is corrupting and taking advantage’ kick again and if we don’t go, he’ll probably think Giles is holding us hostage or something.”
~ “As sweet as that is, will someone kindly find my glasses?” Giles says. “And my spine, if it’s not too much trouble.”
~ “You left me in his care in your will if something was to happen. Remember, you said I would grow up all repressed and full of tea.”
~
“Does he owe you money too?” Dawn asks. “A few hundred pounds.” Angel replies. “And two virgins….which I won’t be collecting, of course.”
~
“It was the first spell I ever did.” Willow stands up and pats him on the arm. “I’ll never forget how to do it.” “And I’m sure you just have an orb….”  “I brought three.” Cordy interrupts. “I ordered them off E-Bay.”
~
“I say wild party down by the pool.” Elliot glares at him. “Less wild party on the roof?” Elliot shakes his head. “Quiet party in the living room where we give them presents, ice cream and those funny hats we can take pictures of them in and later mock?” 
~
“Sure, if by ‘catch up’ you mean ‘rend limb from limb’.”
~
“Watch your words! The Demon-King Lohesh is a great and wondrous being, and you are no more than a flea to it!” “Lohesh?” Faith asked, incredulous. “Dude, Lohesh has been dead for centuries. Oh, come on, surely you know the story? Raised in Siberia by a sorcerer who wanted to Ascend, laid waste to a village, was killed when a hedgewitch performed a spell that dropped an avalanche on its head? Really kind of a sad way to go – I mean, a four-winged soul-sucking demon killed by a heavy snowfall?”
~ Now when they drive anywhere it’s in the convertible, the baby in her lap playing with the ends of her ponytail and Meredith’s hand warm and comforting in his. If they need to escape, he wants to be able to grab his family in an instant and taste the safety of the sky.
~ Parkman takes one look at it when they walk into the room and frowns, makes that face that says, “The things I put up with to save the damn world.”
~
I heard about this guy who broke into a lion’s den at the zoo and got mauled. People were talking about how there should have been better defenses put up to prevent people getting into the cage. A friend of mine suggested setting up some kind of deterrent: for example, putting some sort of fierce animal in the cage, which would attack anybody who climbed in.
~ They forbid weapons on the CPA entrance exam because if you can’t kill your enemies with a No.2 pencil you don’t deserve to be a CPA. 
~
“Sweetie it’s not nothing. I don’t care if you stubbed your toe; if you’re hurting, you call us.”
“Do not call me if you stub your toe,” John stated flatly. Mary backhanded him in the chest without looking.
~
“Who was that? That, that young man a minute ago. The one who just spoke to my parents, and was outgoing, friendly, and everything. Who was that? What did you do with my introverted, bookworm boyfriend?”
He looked away, a momentary smile causing his cheeks to dimple again. “That was ‘Meeting the Girlfriend’s Parents Sam’.”
“Are there any other Sams I need to know about? I didn’t know I got more than one.” Would he ever cease amazing her? She hoped not.
“A few actually. There’s ‘Get Down to Business Sam’, uhm ‘That’s Not What Really Happened Sam’, ‘Surely You Could Let That Pass This Once Sam’, ‘No This Guy is Not My Brother Sam’, and a couple of others. They come in handy on occasion.”
~ “I’m going to vomit.”
“You vomit and I win.”
“What if I die?”
“I still win.”
~
“You made toaster waffles?”
“Told you he’d find out,” the ten-year-old smirked, grabbing a couple of waffles and sliding them onto his plate.
“Well, if someone had hidden the box like I told him to half an hour ago,” Dean hissed, “he never would have noticed, would he?”
~ “Now, let’s clear this up,” Sam began as he eyed a potential car, “this is not stealing-” 
“It’s just borrowing,” Dean finished, “without permission and with no intent to return. I know. Just grab it already.”
~ “We were sitting in the living room, watching TV, and I was catching up on all the school gossip—good thing to do when you first move into a school, you know, find out which teachers to avoid, who the bullies are, that kind of thing—and Dean comes in, all in black, looking like a refugee from a bad Marilyn Manson video—he’d even stolen some eyeliner from somewhere.” Giggles. As if they could appreciate the sheer horror that was an overly-macho, seventeen-year-old Dean Winchester in eyeliner. “Anyhow, he had—” Dad’s favorite machete “—he was carrying this gigantic butcher knife, and he’d—” dipped it in blood “—been using it to carve up some meat for dinner, so it was all bloody, and he had this expression—he looked terrifying. Like he was going to rip Nick’s guts out for snacks. And he’s a strong guy, so it’s entirely possible he could. And then—” Sam smiled at the memory. “He started reciting Latin in his best deep voice, and waved the knife so it flicked blood at Nick. At this thirteen-year-old whose only crime was being nice to the new kid.”
“Your brother knows Latin?” He didn’t recognize the voice, but it sounded impressed.
Sam made himself shrug casually while his mind raced for a decent excuse. “Dad taught us. It was one of his things.” Latin and self-defense and 101 uses for holy water, but no point in bringing all that up. “So. Dean’s standing there, looking like a serious Satan worshipper, and I’m trying to remember—” where the nearest knife is stashed “—trying to think of something that’ll get him to behave, which of course is pointless because when Dad was gone, Dean was in charge, no questions asked. Poor Nick is sitting there looking like he just accidentally wandered into The Addams Family and he doesn’t know if he should be polite or if he should run screaming out the door and call the cops, and all I can think is that I’m never going to make any friends.
“So I started yelling at Dean. In Latin. Only my Latin is way better than his.” That’s why I did all the chanting at exorcisms. “And he has to stop scowling to pay attention, and in the middle of me yelling at him that I just want a few friends I’m not related to and he’s killing my chances of having friends—” or getting laid, because that’s the kind of reason Dean would understand “—he stops short, looks at me, and says ‘What the fuck verb was that?’ Only he can’t glare and ask about verbs at the same time. So he drops the whole persona and starts arguing with me about Latin. Nick’s still sitting there, paralyzed with terror, while Dean and I are arguing over the finer points of Latin conjugations. At the top of our lungs. With a knife in the middle of the conversation 
~
“Jackson won’t buy regular food and if I have to eat that sushi and fish egg crap again…well, let’s not go there.”
Laughing as they walked off, Dean heard Sam’s comment. “I seem to remember us both being accused of being uncultured louts.”
“Damn straight. If I’m going to eat eggs, they better be big enough to fry.”
~ Immediately after what would come to be called “The Job We Never Ever Tell Dad About” Sam drove the Impala, with his brother still stuck to the hood, through a local car wash. Dean nearly drowned. The car wash operator got pissed because the crap coming off of their car (literally) clogged all the drains. He started to get in Dean’s face about it until he realized that almost drowning made Dean really cranky and when Dean was really cranky he liked to shoot at people.
~ Where in the hell does it say ‘dirt road?’ All I see is ‘grunt bus’ and a blob of ketchup! Turn at the ketchup? What the frell is a grunt bus?”
~
“What are you crazy? You could have flipped us!” Dean shouted his voice getting louder with every word. “What part of the, ‘I’m not going to hurt you’ conversation that we had like three seconds ago didn’t you get?”
~
“That’s complicated. Well, ok it’s not complicated. The answer is just going to make me sound really crazy.”
~
“When I come back, we’ll have a password, so you know that it’s really me.” “Dad just says, Let me in, Dean.”
~ “We’re not naming them until we know they won’t eat our souls in the middle of the night,” Sam responded.
“Yeah, sure, of course,” Dean said. “I think that one should be Angus Young.”
“Possible soul eaters, Dean.”
“Fine, that one can be Possible Soul Eater Angus Young.” Dean pointed to another one of the small creatures. “That one can be Possible Soul Eater Malcolm Young, and that one can be Possible Soul Eater-”
“Let me name one,” Sam protested.
~ “No, wait. Go back and explain the thing before the ‘one last thing’,” Dean said.
~
Well, Dean assumed she was adopted, and unless it had become possible for two black guys to give birth to a Chinese girl he’d say it was a pretty good assumption.
~
The guy’s name was Brent, and he was a writer (or maybe he’d said pastry chef) and his partner’s name was Michael (or had it been Mario?) and he ran a web site (or maybe it was a dojo). Dean hadn’t paid much attention during introductions.
~ “Think. Have you done something that would warrant you getting turned into a girl? Pissed anyone off?” he mused aloud, voice ricocheting off the walls of the tiny bedroom and bouncing back to smack him in the ears. He winced at the high pitched tone, and considered becoming a selective mute until the curse, or spell, or whatever the fuck it was, was lifted.
~
“How come I can’t have Fruit Loops?” Sam asked.
“Because you had M&Ms for dinner,” John answered.
“What does that have to do with it?”
“You only get one multi-color meal every twenty four hours,” John said. “House rules.”
~
Jess watches as Sam glares down at him, and wonders if the sheer force of his hatred could be enough to set the drunk on fire.
~
“You’ve got a calendar?”
“The motel’s got a calendar, whatever. Dude, it’s the twenty-second.”
“What year is the calendar, Dean?”
~ He had the urge to lean over and type himself, because the guy was slow like he was freakin eighty and Dean could see from where he was standing that he kept spelling Winchester wrong.
~
“Hey,” Dean said, an urgent tone clear in his voice as he fumbled to unlock the car doors . “The second you pass out I’m gonna tell Jess about the time you found that bottle of nail polish at that motel and decided that hot pink really was your color. I mean it.” And even though Jess knew the purpose behind the remark, she laughed anyway, loud and strong.
“Oh come on,” she said. “I’m sure he just didn’t know any better. How old was he? Five? Six?”
“Eleven,” Dean returned with a smirk.
“Oh God,” Sam groaned as Dean eased him down lengthwise across the back seat of the car. “I hate you both.” But Jess could see the small quirk of a smile on his face.
~
“You’re volunteering to let us kick your ass?”
Doug glared. “We’ll fight back.
Dean looked at him, then back at Tom. “Like I said, you’re letting us kick your ass?”
~
Sam’s a picky eater. “Eat it or wear it” has become Dean’s mantra.
~ “Honk if you’ve never seen a gun shot from a moving vehicle.”
~
“My mind is like a steel trap. Dirty and illegal in most states.”
~ Ms. Horson shook her head, her watery eyes going glassy. “Oh, it hurts me to tell the parents of our dear students the truth, knowing that they often hold their children in such a high regard-”
“What’d he do now?” inquired John flatly
~
“You’re lucky I don’t believe in patricide,” Dean snapped, and crossed his arms.  John raised an eyebrow. “Have you been helping Sam study again?”  “You wouldn’t believe the crazy ass words they give him on his spelling tests,” Dean said.
~
“If you want to live, don’t ever say that word again,” Dean said. “And also, you should beat that Jeremy kid up.”
~
“You really don’t do normal very well, do you?” Sam asked. “How about quiet, can you do quiet?”
~ “I’m not happy about this. I think me and Calvin Klein are gonna have to have a talk.”  “You can’t kill Calvin Klein,” Dean said.  “I said talk,” John said.  “When you say talk you mean kill,” Dean said.  “He’s right,” Sam agreed. “Talk means kill in dadspeak. Kind of like I’ll be there right at five means I’ll be twenty minutes late.”
~ “Do you even know what that means?”  “Hey, I watch soap operas,” Sam said.  “Not anymore you don’t,” John snapped. “What the hell are they putting on TV these days?”
~ “Dude, who knew werewolves had fleas?” Dean grins, gently coaxing him, till Sam snorts softly and sighs. “Friggin werewolf cooties.”
~ “I went to the dollar store,” Pam says, getting the rings out of the baggie. “I think they’re going to turn our fingers green.”  “Excellent,” Jim says, and reaches out to take the bigger one.
~
“Nice index cards,” she’d said. “Very eighth-grade book report.” “Look,” he’d said, twitching them away when she tried to read them. “We can’t all turn to Mussolini in our hour of need.”
~
“Wow, blow our cover. When did you get so committed to your life of crime?” “Shut up,” Pam says, and slings her backpack down onto the bed.  “Besides,” Jim says. “Maybe we just don’t sleep in the same bed. Maybe the romance is gone.” Pam rolls her eyes at him. “Maybe,” Jim says, “you kick. Maybe you have the jimmy legs.” He picks up the phone and starts dialing down to the front desk. “The jimmy legs?” Pam says. “How come I have the jimmy legs? Maybe you hog the covers. Maybe I couldn’t take one more night of you turning yourself into a human burrito.” The front desk picks up. 
“Yes, hi,” Jim says. “This is Jim Halpert in room 505? My wife and I were mistakenly put in a room with only one bed, and she has the jimmy legs.” Pam makes a noise of outrage.
~
“I don’t want to bore everybody, but I am talking about selling office supplies, so it’s a little inevitable.”
~ There was a structural engineering textbook lying on counter, beside a couple of mugs they liberated from a diner in Wisconsin. It was carefully placed to look casual but impossible to miss, and Dean mentally rolled his eyes at Sam. He picked it up anyways, out of curiosity, and by the time Sam came out for breakfast, Dean was yelling at the textbook, saying stuff like why the extra support beams when a perfectly good keystone would do.
~
Dean was already moving towards the door, and Sam got out of his chair, catching the Glock Dean threw at him and saying “Just a minute!” at the door with the same breath.
~
“This end of the world shit is pretty damn boring. All the television stations are broadcasting the damn emergency broadcast system. Humanity is dying out and I can’t even watch some decent soft core porn.” “First, there is no such thing as decent soft core porn…”
~
“No way! You’ll drive us into a ditch and we’ll be eaten by sunflowers.” “I don’t think sunflowers are carnivorous, and you didn’t sleep last night.”
~ He woke up when the car stopped suddenly, tires squealing. He had a calm, sure moment of so this is how I die, letting Sammy park us in a tree and then he was scrambling up and looking forward at the deer standing in the middle of the road, antlers high, white in the headlights.
~ Dean pushed against the woods but the woods pushed back, verdant and overgrown, vines everywhere, eating up the trees, covering the treeline. Dean swore. “How the hell am I supposed get through here?” Sam gave him a look that said you are a sad fucking retard, and motioned to the machete in his hands.
~ “I know you know this already but you’re going away and I can’t watch out for you any I know you have that blade in your duffle. No, I’m glad. It’s a good one. Always keep a fine edge on it. Use flint when it’s wet, not matches. If you find yourself into a girl, and she smells like a mix between peaches and milkweed, back the fuck off. Attack first. Keep your fists low, head up. And white lights in the woods can be all kinds of things: reflecting headlights, streetlights, fireflies. But blue lights are never normal-”
~ “Well, when it came time to choose between ‘Controlling Your Psychic Tendencies,’ and Intro to Finance, dumb old me picked Finance.”
~ Dad didn’t even know the psychic thing had kicked in for Sam and somehow, Dean didn’t think texting ‘Sam psychic now. Brain apparently exploding. Helpful hints greatly appreciated’ was the way to impart that particular message.
~
“All I have to do is put my hand on your forehead and extend my arm. Fighting you off is hardly the challenge it was when I was seven.”
~
“You have got to be kidding me,” Dean said before he was finished with the first paragraph. “Soul-stealing cats? That’s older than ‘the call is coming from inside the house!’ Besides, man, it’s a nursing home. There’s hardly anything supernatural about old, sick people dying.” Sam conceded the point with another shrug. “Yeah, but the numbers don’t add up. I’m mean, the last ten years, the mortality rate for their critical care patients has been constant--a standard deviation of plus or minus, like, an infinitesimal number.” Dean thought about if for a second, then threw out, “The population is getting older. More old people, higher mortality rates, right?” Sam shook his head. “It’s considered one of the best facilities in the state--beds always filled to capacity, so the statistics are about as clean as they can be. Federal regulators have been in three times, in the last four months, but they haven’t found any glaring violations.” Dean made a sour face. “Which obviously points to the critical care ward being stalked by a soul-stealing kitty cat.” “Residents reported seeing a cat wandering the hallways almost every night that someone died. It’s the only link I could find.” “Good thing we don’t have to worry about any of our witnesses being senile or anything, huh?” Sam laughed. “Man, I swear, there is nothin’ else going on in that town. I mean, nothing. The lead story in the afternoon’s paper was the high school abstinence club unsponsoring a couple of penguins at the local zoo because they just found out the penguins were both male. And, apparently, not exactly practicing abstinence.”
~
“ESPN is rebroadcasting the KU game,” he continued “And if you know, don’t tell me who...” “KU won by three,” Sam said on top of Dean’s words. He looked up with a guilty wince. “Oops, sorry,” he said.
~
Sam glared at the juice glass. “It’s got pulp in it,” he whined. “It’s like drinking a paper towel.”
~ “All the scenarios Dad and I batted around after you left, neither one of us ever thought to worry about you becoming a gigolo.” “Yeah that would have been an interesting call home,” he said. “Hello, Dad? I think I might have accidentally trafficked in human flesh.” Dean laughed at the image. “And we all know what Dad would have said.” Sam imitated his father’s booming voice. “Dean! Talk to your brother!”
~ “You’re like one of those idiot savants without the savant.” “That’s just stupid.” “And yet I never accidentally became a prostitute.” ~
“I offered to hire a housekeeper, but no, you apparently like doing your own laundry, even though I’ve told you time and again that we can just buy you new clothes after the old ones start to smell—”
~
Veronica squinted at the brush. “Is that-- for grout? Logan, do you even know what grout is?” He gestured expansively. “We are buying things for the house, and I am helping. Look at that brush! Definitely for the house. And if it becomes old and worn out? Probably available online.”
~ “How was I supposed to know she was some sort of amateur hydrangea freak?” “The picture on her shirt wasn’t a big clue there?” “I didn’t exactly know what a hydrangea looked like.”
“Then why’d you even say it?” “The Manchurian Candidate was on the night before.” Sam shook his head, blanking at that one. “Hello, non sequitur.” “You know, there was that scene, where they’re being brainwashed, with the annoying woman going on about the stupid hydrangeas. What? Why are you looking at me like that?”He flexed his face into something less incredulous as Dean glared at him. 
“It just really scares me how much you absorb from popular media.” “It was a good movie! It’s not like I could have told her we were making our own bombs. Hydrangea was the next best thing.” “Except for the part where it was the wrong fertilizer for hydrangeas.” “And again, how was I supposed to know that? I mean, c’mon, what are the chances that I’d get trapped by the one freakin’ person in the place who’d know that? But it’s me, so of course I do and then I get lectured and have to be rescued by Dad.”
~ “I did not steal your freakin’ childhood joy.” “You did! Dad lets us indulge in one, count it, one holiday activity and you go behind my back and take it away from me.”
“Yeah, Sam, that’s exactly what happened.” “It is! I had it all planned out, sketches and everything.” Dean snorted. “Seriously. Even at twelve you were a nerd.” Sam ignored it and glared. “And what did you do?” “I helped.” “You usurped my pumpkin.” “Usurped. Okay, you get how silly that sounds, right?”
~ They’d been reduced to drinking rainwater collected from the gutters and if it didn’t rain soon, they were going to be risking dehydration. He might actually have been concerned about it if it wasn’t so obvious that they weren’t going to be around long enough for it to be a problem. 
~
“What the hell is this?” he says. His face wrinkles with distaste. “It tastes like grass.”  “And you would know,” John remarks. “You ate it by the fistful when you were three.”
~ “You think she’s right? I mean, wouldn’t someone know or something? There’d be some sign, right? You hit puberty, you sprout wings?”
~ “They blinded him. How do you think he’s doing? Running into furniture and swearing all the time.”
~ “Sounds like something your dad would say. Always fine. Bet he’d say that if he lost a limb. ‘I’m fine, Aaron. Just missing a hand.’”
~ “I know I’m in no place to tell you what to do –” “‘Then don’t,” interrupts John. Al shakes his head as John lifts himself off the bed, struggling against –- something. He frowns, confused.  “Yeah, that’d be the hit to your back,” Al supplements. “Gonna listen to me, now?”
~ “If the siren’s on, he’s still alive,” John replies as evenly as he can. “They don’t turn it on if someone’s dead.”
~ “I…have not read that,” he says blankly. “Good choice,” she tells him. “They’re doing boob-enhancing exercises. And chanting.” “Wait, boob…what? Chanting? Are you just screwing with me again?” He pulls the book from her hands to look at it himself.
~
“And that’s when the Chief Justice will tell you to raise your right hand and put your left hand on the Bible.”
“What do I do then?
“You raise your right hand and put your left on the Bible.”
“And will there be someone who will tell me when it’s time to do that?”
~
Dean pointed a finger at him. “Is that crazy-talk, Sam? I thought we discussed this. There will be no mental breakdowns in my car.”
~
“Your dad said not to…”
“So?” Jack says like Sam’s mentally deficient. “He also says that computers run by gerbils on little wheels.”
~ When Jack turns ten, he goes on his first hunt and explodes a vampire with his mind
~ Sam had actually spent an embarrassing amount of time devoted to this theory. He’d been pretty shocked his first year of college at how many girls seemed to get drunk and show up in his dorm room in their underwear. He’d needed a theory.
~
“Sammy, you been fidgeting around there for a mile. Either you wanna share your feelings or you’ve got crabs. If it’s the first, spit it out already. If it’s the second, get the fuck out of my car and bleach your crotch.”
~ Sammy is four and he is already an evil genius. Which is how John came to spend four hours tracking his missing son, whom Sammy had said ran away to join the circus, and Dean spent four hours locked in the trunk in the worst game of hide and go seek in the history of the world.
~
The men have apparently decided that a football game requires the use of garden tools, but her brother seems to be holding his own in the spontaneous rake-hoe-shovel fight that has erupted on the grass.
~ “If you flew into a moon, everyone back on base would just say, oh, that fuckin’ Winchester, we saw it coming.” Fordham’s grin turned evil. “Hey, I bet there’s a pool going somewhere on when and how weirdly you die. Gotta get in on that.”
~ Parrish was as close to the fire as he could safely get him, lying as comfortably as possible on the emptied pack, and if his confused expression was any indication, badly concussed
~ “You’re not going to tell any ghost stories, are you?” Parrish asked groggily. “I’m only kind of conscious, and you’ll give me nightmares.”
~
“You’re telling me you have prophetic visions?” “He can bend spoons, too.” Sam finally looked up again to huff, “I can not.” “Well if you’d just apply yourself like a good little geek…” “Once. I used telekinesis once.”
~
Then again, with this conversation, would death be so bad?
~
“You are a liar. Or you tried it on a guy and you’re trying to get around it by being female-specific. Oh, I just had a horrible thought: I drive and give you lots of time to ogle guys out the window. You’re not, you know, doing that are you?” Holy God, he was going to kill his brother. No jury would convict him.  “Five seconds ago you were practically drooling over the idea that I could feel up some chick’s boobs and now you’re all horrified that I might do it to a guy. Do you know what you are? A hypocrite. Also, possibly homophobic. I haven’t decided.”
~
Dean just sat there, tossing a knife from hand to hand, discussing Sam’s utter humiliation like it was something they did every day. Actually, this week? Pretty much.
~
“Look, you have powers for a reason,” he said, like that was so reasonable it was just obvious Sam should agree with him.  “Yeah, a bad reason. A very bad, death-dealing, brain-eating, I-want-to-drink-your-blood kind of reason.”
~
“Oh, don’t get all ethical on me. Think of it as an issue of liberty. You’re liberating the beer, Sammy. It wants to be free.”
~
“It’s not a dress. It’s a gown. Judges wear them.”  “Women wear them. Our society has elevated cross-dressing to a sanctified ritual. We should definitely insert mud-wrestling into it somewhere.”
~
“I’d rock that tutu, I have you know. I’d make it manly. And hot. Your classmates would swoon.”
~
His voice took on that stern note that he got whenever he was about to lecture about “appropriate” and “blending in” and “living in the world not above it.”
~
“It’s your present,” Dean said, just in case that wasn’t clear. Entirely possible it wasn’t. The Irish car bombs might have been a bad idea.
~
The last thing he remembered—well, he was vertical back then, he was pretty sure.
~
“You alive?” Sam asked lowly, opening his eyes and turning his head at a speed molasses would own because he knew how head injuries worked and maybe, just maybe, he could avoid more pain to write home about.  “Do I get a choice?” Dean grunted. “My head hates me. My head is currently building toward a blood feud with me,” he whined. Dean lay on his back, such as he could, glaring at the ceiling like it had insulted their mother, and most assuredly not moving.
~
“On a scale of one to ten my head is at about a fifty-seven million and climbing to infinity,” he grumbled, rolling over and onto all fours and breathing shallowly.  “You can never reach infinity,” Sam said, picking the most important part of that statement to comment on. He fell back, gritting his teeth and sucking in a breath at the way motion seemed to scrape some very sharp object across the base of his skull, spreading little white dots and oh, yeah, pain across all his nerve endings. “Thought my head was impressive like that,” Dean muttered, still on his hands and knees and looking at the floor like it could give him strength, just give him strength and he could get through this. Or possibly that was Sam projecting. Sam huffed out a belated laugh—synapses not firing right now, obviously, and did there really need to be a humiliating middle-ground in head injuries? Couldn’t it just be unconsciousness or death?
~
Sam turned back to the bars of the cage and the cave beyond. “What is this thing?” Sam asked. He shook his head at the bizarreness of his life. Because, yeah, cage. Dean waited for a beat, looking at Sam obviously. “A cage?” he asked. He waved a hand in front of Sam’s face, like he was making sure Sam was still with him in the land of the sight-enabled.
~
“Others? What, you kidnap girls and then watch?” “Yeah, doing it from a cage just heightens the experience. Bars frame you so perfectly.” Dean held up his hands in a frame and winked at her through it. “What he means is we’re prisoners, too,” Sam said, trying for soothing again despite how much Dean was helping. “Prisoners of what?” she asked. Worried eyes blinked at them, even as her hands continued working at the manacles. Good point. “Bigfoot?” Dean asked Sam, like an offering. “You ever heard of a white Bigfoot?” Sam shot back. “Maybe it’s really old and all its fur turned grey.” “Oh, yeah, let’s go with that theory.” “Wow, I’m so not depending on you two geniuses to get me out of here,”
~
“You’re not going to make me wear an apron, are you?” he asked, watching Sam warily, like Sam could magically snap his fingers and a frilly pink apron would appear on him. Because if Sam used magic, that’d totally be what he’d do first.
~
“Cheese pizza, questionably-cooked mutant turkey, and hot sauce? Dude, worst combination ever.”
“Don’t be such a downer. You haven’t even tried it.” “Because if I do there’s a good chance I’ll die afterwards.”
~
“I thought I said no talking unless you were in a better mood?” “That’s working out really well for you, isn’t it?”
~
If he ever needed confirmation that his brother was in ridiculously good shape, this would be sufficient, Dean attacking a series of push-ups like some rabid Energizer bunny, all glistening muscles and that one hand held loosely at the small of his back, like real push-ups were for lesser mortals, watch as Dean effortlessly scoffed at them.
~ “Would you stop being petulant?”  “I could if I knew what that meant.” “Now you’re just being deliberately obtuse.” “And now you’re just using bigger words to prove you can.”
~
“You know what I think?” Dan asked. “That the prop people should have checked to make sure the handcuffs were fake before they gave them to us?”  “Well, that too.”
~ The demon does the math in his head, thinks of a devil’s trap on the car and that damn Colt in the trunk and Sam’s power leaving a dark vacant smear in the air, as if the boy’s psychic abilities had slammed the door on their way out of existence with a shouted, “You think I can’t? Well, just watch me.” He adds it together in his head and wonders if sheer force of will from the battered mind of a dying man can turn a car into a weapon.
~
Blaine isn’t in the room just then, because theoretically he’s in class but realistically he’s probably out throwing glowsticks at random passersby in the quad while downing Jager bombs. Sam has more faith in the latter being true than that Blaine would ever approach a classroom voluntarily. Sam really hopes Blaine doesn’t plan on sleeping any time soon, because if he does go to sleep, Sam plans to smother him with a pillow. what he can see is Blaine turning on his CD player and adjusting the photo of him with the Hilton girls and Sam’s never wanted to throw a Russian literature book at someone’s head so much in his life.
~
Yeah, it was nice. I had a real nice time... Yup, she was cremated.
~
“So, I thought I might like him, and we went on some fun dates, but then he shaved his head and now I can't go out with him.”
“Wait, what's wrong with him shaving his head?”
“Well, nothing in theory, but now he looks like a terrorist.”
~
“So, that club she got turned away from? It was for not having on two pieces of corduroy clothing. You know what kind of club that is? A club full of poorly-dressed people.”
~
“And you know one of those guys is going to wake up tomorrow and be like, 'Why am I wearing a kimono?!'”
~ Book-hawking hobo: “And this is my new book, 'If You Don't Beat Your Children, They'll End Up Like Me'!”

Blonde tourist #1: “I think we have plenty of time before our train leaves. What time is it?” Blonde tourist #2: “I have no idea. My cell phone is dead. [To passing suit] Um, sir? Do you know what time it is?” Suit, rolling his eyes up at huge clock, then at blondes: “Nope.” --Grand Central info booth with four-sided clock on top
~
“I don’t know…it’s like, for the first time in a long time, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.”
“It’s hellfire, Dean.”
~ "That'd be very helpful, ma'am," Young interrupted, staring at the low point of the vee in her secretary's sweater. Unprofessional, but she couldn't really fault him. Beverly had never discussed appropriate office attire with her secretary because the support staff always came by to make sure they had a full supply closet and working light bulbs on days Viv wore her pink cashmere top.
~
"Officer Calder is here," said her assistant, who was probably as pleased by the prospect of never saying those words again as she was about not hearing them.
~ "Name's Calder," Rob's father told him anyway, looming in and using to full advantage the height and bulk his son was inheriting. "Do you know what your son did to my kid?" Winchester planted his feet apart, chin tilted up. "Nope," he answered cheerfully. "Is he the concussion or the broken wrist?"
~
“So. How are we going to do this?”  “With dull clichés, I guess. You know, I have something you want, you have something I want, I’m here to trade.”  “It’s the twenty-first century, man. Move past the barter economy.”
~ He took the paper from Sam’s hand, stifling a grunt of surprise when he saw the design. Whatever book Sam had found had misidentified the protective circle, and it couldn’t possibly be effective anyway: over generations of recopying the runes had grown distorted and misshapen, and part of the drawing was lost entirely. Somewhere back in the sketch’s ancestry, though, someone had seen the real deal, and there was the remotest chance that someone with the right knowledge and resources could reconstruct it. Note to self: burn Penn’s Rare Books Library, slaughter Religious Studies faculty.
~ He snarled, jerking around to turn his back to Sam, nostrils flaring as he brought under control the annoying adrenal responses that came with emotion when he possessed these creatures. “If there was ever a ritual that could destroy me,” he said, turning around and sounding as neutral as he could after that embarrassing display of weakness, “it’s been gone for centuries.”
“Not gone,” Sam answered, kneeling just outside the circle. “Rare.”
~ “You want to know the worst of it?” Sam asked after another shot. “He didn’t trust me enough to give me one last order. You know, like, ‘Sam! Don’t turn evil!’” His voice rose to a bark on the last line, then dropped again. “How hard would that have been, Dean? What could it have hurt?”
~
It took Sam two seconds after entering the bar to realise this might be one of Dean’s less brilliant ideas, it took him four beers and seven tequila shots to forget that completely.
~ ‘Why aren't you answering the question?’ Her mouth swung into a smirk, and she leaned over across the bar crushing her lips onto his and hungrily nibbling on his lower lip. ‘Does that answer your question?’
Sam frowned. ‘It depends…What was my question?’
~ Had he been sober then he’d have known not to reply to her question. ‘What the hell do you mean by that?’
But Sam wasn’t sober and he’d never been good at ignoring women. He leaned closer over enunciating each word, ‘Well what I mean is I don’t know how many other men you’ve been with.’
Her voice had developed an edge now, ‘WHAT?’
Sam sighed. ‘Do you have a hearing problem? I’m sorry I just mean that you could have been anywhere, you know?’He didn’t feel the slap until a good five seconds after he heard it. ‘OW!’ He reeled back, dizzy, ‘you just slapped my face.’
~ ‘Oh kid, that was some performance.’ A big blurry shape that looked suspiciously human smiled from the barstool next to him.
‘May the power of Christ compel you.’ Sam shot back squinting at this new foe. Suddenly something was thrust into Sam’s hand and he found himself staring into another bottle of beer. He brought it right to his eye and peered in suspiciously. ‘This is a beer.’
~ Sam smiled as the fuzzy shapes danced before him, heh, they were funny, all different colors and pretty…color was cool. It made things pretty. The sun was yellow…yeah that’s right…yellow like Dean’s hair and cheese…wow cheese was good…he could have some cheese right now…
~ "It was aliens," said Gwen.  Martha nodded, having already guessed that.  Of course it was aliens.   It was always aliens. 
~ Substantive Charms of the Polish Magical Renaissance sounded vaguely familiar but it turned out to be printed in Latin, which was enough to discourage her from further investigation of its contents. A slim volume entitled A Horse of a Different Colour proved to be exactly what the title suggested – instructions for brewing potions that would turn your steed various bright colours, should anyone ever think of a remotely sensible reason for doing so. A Victorian book called Jolly Japes For The Jovial Jinxer looked like fun, but since most of the jolly japes seemed to require their targets to be wearing crinolines or driving carriages, it was understandable that it was now out of print.
~ “If I had to guess…” Grizzly’s answer was interrupted by the slamming of a door and heavy, hurried footsteps. “He’ll be here any time now,” the man finished, taking a step back from Dean.
~
“Hey. You’re awake. How do you feel?”
“Like shit.”
“That’s a step above the way you look.”
~ “How’s he doing, Buzz?”
“Nearly took my hand off when he woke up, so I’d say the immediate danger has passed.”
~ "You can't help me," she said in a harsh voice, "I'm dead."
"Right... you noticed. That's... good." Sam shifted awkwardly in his seat and heroically resisted the impulse to pull at his hair. This was one of the more bizarre conversations he'd ever had and given his life, that was really saying something.
~ Dean had a cover story all worked out by the time they got to the hospital. It was a brilliant and heroic tale in which he single-handedly fought off five guys—muggers—Hell's Angels—who had dared to attack his baby brother. He was just working out the last few corroborating details in his head when Sam shoved him into a chair and said, "he crashed his dirt bike" to the cute redhead at the admissions desk.
"'Crashed his dirt bike?'" Dean hissed under his breath when Sam sat down next to him with a clipboard and a handful of forms. "What kind of stupid cover story is that?"
"The kind people actually believe," Sam said calmly. "As opposed to the epic bullshit you were going to tell her."
"You don't even know what I was going to tell her!" Dean protested. Sam didn't look up from his scribbling, but one corner of his mouth curled upward just enough to make the dimple in his cheek show up.
"You know that nobody actually buys your stories of taking out whole biker gangs single-handed, right? All those girls who smile and nod — they're just humoring you."
"They do a lot more than smile and nod," Dean smirked. Sam ignored him and kept on scribbling on the forms.
~ "There are herbs to facilitate astral travel. Those 'flying ointments' used in the middle ages weren't really for flying. I thought we could—"
"Whoa, you are not smearing anything involving wolfbane or deadly nightshade on any part of your body. That's non-negotiable."
"I know." Sam gave him a crooked smile. "The fat of unbaptized infants is right out, too, in case you were wondering."
"That's good to know."
"There are modern variations on the formula. I'm sure if we poke around, we can come up with something that doesn't involve toxic substances or dead babies."
~
“God, this is weird, you know? I can’t hear myself talking. I don’t even know if I am talking. I don’t know if you can hear me. But if you can, tap me on the right shoulder.” Dean reached out and tapped. There was a long pause. “...OK, that was my left shoulder, but I’m gonna assume that that wasn’t deliberate.”
~
“OK, so my idea is that I can ask you questions and you can tap me on the shoulder, one tap for yes, two for no. Got it?”
“That’s your great idea? Jesus, that’s pathetic,” said Dean, and tapped once.
“Good,” Sam said, smiling excitedly. “OK, so, did you get the police report like I said?” One tap. “Did you find out anything new?” One tap. “What did you find out?”
Dean closed his eyes. “For God’s sake.” He tapped fifteen times on Sam’s shoulder, just to mess with him.
Sam’s smile turned into a frown. “Shut up,” he said. Dean wondered what the tap-symbol for this system needs a bigger vocabulary was.
~
Sam had always seemed to him to have two basic settings: angsty and silent, which was annoying because damn that kid knew how to do emo, and demanding and needling, which was annoying too because God did he ever shut up? Now he had only one, mute and afraid, and Dean wished that he could just hear Sam telling him he was a jerk or questioning his orders, just once, just once.
~
“Wait a second, I’ve just got to finish my coffee,” Sam said, and the cup flew across the room into his hand. Sam stared at the cup. Dean stared at Sam. After a moment, Dean strode to the courtesy coffee-making set that rested by the old TV. 
“Bend this spoon,” he ordered, holding out the implement to Sam. Sam stared. 
“Dean, you know I can’t--” and the spoon bent in Dean’s hand.
 “You think that thing might have flipped a few extra switches while it was screwing about in your brain?”
~
Dean cleared his throat and wiped the blood off his lips with the back of his hand. “What’d I tell you,” he said, grinning and feeling his ribs to see if they were broken. “Easiest job ever.”
~
“I mean it, man. You’ve got to calm down. Unless you want the furniture to go postal on us again.”
~
“I have potentially lethal telekinesis that I can’t control,” Sam said tiredly. “How is that not a big deal.”
~ “But Dean, my vision...”
“It can wait.” That was the least of their worries right now.
“No, no it can’t. People could die.”
“Yeah, Sam, and your head could explode.” Or worse, this damn gas station.
~
“People get nosebleeds from doing too much coke not from seeing the future. Are you seriously trying to tell me you think this is normal?”
~
“Loud,” he whispered.
“Sam,” Dean said, and Sam winced at the sound, and outside the window there was a muffled pop and a shower of unripe sweetcorn kernels rained onto the hood. Dean stared out of the window in consternation, but the field of corn that bordered the road just stood there, innocent and ordinary.
“Sam,” he tried again, trying to pitch his voice lower, and there was another pop and more flying kernels.
“Loud,” choked Sam again.
Dean drew a breath and spoke, barely letting his vocal cords vibrate. “Sam, are you blowing up corn?”
Sam gave a soundless laugh. “Yeah, guess so,” he whispered. “Better than the tires, right?”
“Dude, corn.” There was another pop. Well, if this isn’t the most ridiculous situation ever.
~
And it was at that moment that the demon fell to the ground with a thud, and the sound and light drained away like water through the cracks in the floorboards, and Sam made a small noise, slumped forward, and lay still. Then Dean noticed that the house was on fire.
~
Sam was different. It wasn’t major, just a few little things. He didn’t remember a childhood incident that they had joked about just a few weeks before. He had trouble with words for simple things like water and gun. Sometimes he said things that didn’t make any sense and then stared at Dean like he expected him to understand. Of course, that last one was nothing new.
~
“Maybe she’s just... more attuned to the supernatural than we are.”
“More attuned? What are you, a politician? Just say psychic, for God’s sake.”
“OK, maybe she’s psychic.”
“Don’t be an idiot. There’s no such thing.”
~
He knew as soon as he’d said it that it was absolutely the wrong thing to say, that he might as well have stood up and announced to the entire world that he liked to eat kittens for breakfast (which, gross), and now the cop was looking at him with undisguised suspicion.
~ “I don’t see a ghost, Dean,” Sam said quietly, and Dean felt his flesh crawl. Ghosts could be visible and they could be invisible, and they could be something in between, which was freaky and annoying, but as far as he knew they couldn’t be visible only to certain people.
“You don’t?” Dean looked at Waistcoat Guy. Waistcoat Guy looked at Dean and smiled smugly. “Dude, he’s right there.”
~
Dean’s beginning to wonder if he has a drinking problem; there’s a hell of a lot of beer bottles out back, waiting to be recycled, and the first thing Dean thought when he saw them was wow, I recycle, but now he thinks wow, I drink a lot of beer.
~ “Where’s Sam?” Dean shouted.
“After I finish you, I’m going after him.” It was all the information Dean needed. The man had no idea where Sam was, hadn’t gotten to him, didn’t have him tied up or trapped somewhere. Shouting, Dean brought both fists up and slammed them down as hard as he could.
~ “Hey Sam, maybe next time you come to visit could you not be possessed or kidnapped or anything?” Bobby said, slight smirk on his face.
A slow smile spread across Sam’s face, lingering a bit, which made Dean feel warm. “Yeah, I’ll work on that.”
~ “You go out for burgers and get possessed, you go to a video store and get kidnapped by a deranged psychopath…I’m seeing a pattern here.”
“That I can’t have burgers or see a video again?” Cause really that was how Dean’s mind worked.
~
“Oh sure, cheating on a test actually ends the world one time, and you just can’t let it go."
~ “Or what if it just pisses it off more?”
“Sam it’s a tree,” Dean reminded dully. Sam’s head tilted with a flat, pointed look. Dean glanced at the black, twisted branches again and conceded, “Alright it’s a very resentful tree. But I know for a fact we don’t have time to go researching a cleansing ritual to perform and I’m not too keen on setting fire to something that’s had a habit of spawning gumball grenades in its offspring.”
~ Sam tried to wipe the stream of blood trailing down his face with his jacket sleeve as his hands were already too covered in blood. He let out a frustrated sigh as another explosion rocked the truck slightly. “Hey Dean,” he said conversationally, “remember when I told you about that cursed tree that dropped exploding gumballs… and you laughed at me?” Another explosion off to their left; Dean ignoring him as he yanked the hose free and began trying to un-bend the lever. “It’s just a tree Sam,” the younger Winchester casually imitated, gesturing with his bloody hand as his brother smacked the bent lever against the tank. Another explosion, behind them this time. “Holy water will kill it for sure Sam,” he added flippantly, lightly patting the water tank with his hand, leaving bloody handprints behind. “Let’s get on with it Sam, I don’t wanna miss lunc-”
“Are you seriously gonna bitch while we’re getting gumball grenaded?!” Dean yelled incredulously over another explosion.
“You do realize there’s a tree shooting exploding missiles everywhere…” two explosions both on the right side, “and we’re hiding behind a diesel-fueled truck leaking gas.” Dean paused, his head lifting slightly from his work on the hose. He comically glanced around at their bomb shelter. “Freakin A!” he suddenly bellowed.
~ Dean spit out a mouthful of dirt and painfully lifted his head, his eyes widening as he took in the huge crater where the tree once presided. Dirt practically rained from the sky; some of it slowly drifting down like snow, the rest dropping in large chunks. Absolutely nothing of the tree remained, not even a single gumball that he could see from his position on his stomach. A gargantuan, mushroom-shaped plume of smoke filled the sky, signaling half of Texas to their victory. “Woo-Hoo-Hoo!” Dean hooted through a beaming smile as he pushed himself over onto his back. “That was freaking awesome,” he exclaimed loudly with a laugh. He lifted his head to gaze happily at what was left of the smoldering crater once more. He openly laughed again in smug triumph. “How’d you like them gumballs, bitch,” he loudly taunted with delight. He finally released a happy sigh and let his head drop back and then roll to the side to check out his partner in crime fifteen feet away. “Sammy, how you doin,” he asked casually with a content smile.
Sam lay flat on his back, arms and legs splayed out, his eyes tiredly staring straight up. “I hate you - so - damn - much.”
“From now on,” he pointed an enthusiastic finger at his sibling, “we kill everything with Holy water.”
“Does that include your ego?”
~
“Dodge Dart Demon. Which narrows the model year down to ’71 or ’72.” Dean chewed the inside of his cheek thoughtfully for a moment. “I’m gonna say ’71. 340 package. 275 horsepower.”
Sam stared at his brother. “I thought you couldn’t see the car?”
Dean hopped off of the bed, titling his head and wincing slightly. “No, but I could hear it.”
“And you could tell all of that?” Sam sounded genuinely awestruck.
“Dude,” Dean said with a frown, still awkwardly pulling his jacket sleeve over his casted wrist. “There’s no way you’re not a chick.”
~
“You dig like a girl.”
“That’s original.”
“Well, it’s taking you so long to dig that hole that I’m out of insults.” A shovelful of dirt suddenly flew up out of the hole right in front of him, and Dean ducked to the left, dirt raining down on him. “The hell, Sam?”
Sam looked up with an innocent smile. “Slipped.”
~
“Dude. Person’l space.”
Sam’s grin widened, that knot in his stomach slowly starting to loosen. “Yeah, well get used to it. Ambulance is on its way.” Dean groaned and struggled to shove up on his elbow, trying to sit up without an inch of success. He fell back and continued to blink hard at Sam. “Why?” he breathed.
“Because I’m not moving you and I don’t have a medical degree.” Dean’s eyebrows rose and fell with a wince. 
He tried for a smile, and it came out a pained, crooked quirk of his mouth. “Get t’ work on that.”
Sam sat back on the center console, patting Dean’s leg. “First thing in the morning, man.”
~
"You should've just given me the skull," John went on.
"I know, I'm sorry," he apologized, trying to sound sincere. "I didn't realize you could hold onto a skull the size of a volleyball, protect yourself from a murderous ghost, and reload a frickin' shotgun, all at the same time. My mistake."
~
After a tense, quiet moment, Dean finally looked up, his face impassive as he eyed the two of them. Then he let out a low whistle. “All right, that didn’t work,” he said with a slight smirk. “Time for the lightning round. What was my first car?” he asked them.
“’67 Chevy Impala,” Sam told him with a frown. This was his new plan? Now they were playing who knows Dean better?
“It was Dad’s,” George added, and Sam had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep his anger in check.
“First hunt?”
“A ghost in Missouri,” George said quickly.
Sam grunted in annoyance. “You were nine,” he jumped in, refusing to be outdone.
“Boxers or briefs?”
They both rolled their eyes. “Boxer-briefs.”
“Favorite band?”
“Led Zeppelin,” Sam replied instantly.
“Birthday.”
“August 12th, 1979,” snapped George before Sam could open his mouth. Dean’s plan sucked.
“Coffee.”
George answered first. “Two sugars--”
“--No cream,” Sam finished for him.
“Who's the black private dick who's the sex machine with all the chicks?" Their frowns were identical. 
“Shaft,” they replied in unison, and Dean’s face split into a wide grin. Then without missing a beat, he asked, “Favorite color.” 
Suddenly, Sam blinked and stumbled. He felt blood drain from his face and his stomach fall when he realized his mind was blank. “Black?” The word had barely left his mouth when George jumped in with triumphant glee. “Silver,” he answered confidently. Even as his heart jumped into his throat, Sam immediately started to protest. “Oh, come on, Dean!” he complained. “That’s not even a real co-” But then he saw the flicker of alarm that swept across George’s face – and at the same time, in one swift motion, Dean spun and aimed his gun at him.
~
“Is it really that bad?” Sam asked, wincing because his voice came out more raspy than he intended.
“No, no, of course not,” Dean rushed to assure him. “You just have a frickin' hole in the middle of your body.”
~ “Generally speaking I don’t like lines of work that need euphemisms like ‘their kind of work.’”
~
“Teal’c’s in there now, getting him ready.”
“Tying him up,” the archaeologist corrected absently, still poring over the ritual.
~
The man surveyed the group. “Ah.” He turned to his companion. “You owe me a fiver, Lucie. I told you they were real.”
The young woman sniffed. “All I see is a buncha blokes with funny eyes,” she said. “And that could be a lot of things.”
“Mmm. Not a bad point.” He turned a sunny smile on the watching abominations. “I wonder if you could clarify something for my skeptical friend here. Are you, by chance, demons?” They stared at him.
~
Demons moved damned fast when they wanted to–inhumanly fast. But what began as the blonde demon moving in a blur toward the Doctor’s throat as she came behind him ended with her suddenly dangling several inches off the ground, his hand wrapped around her throat. He was smiling again–though it was only a smile by loose definition. 
“Who said I was human?” said the Doctor. “And I’m not playing any games. Don’t,” he added, not turning his head. Another demon, thinking to ambush him, froze. His friend grinned, and aimed another kick at her captor’s shin.
~
“Just Ka’r? Not Ka’r, the high and mighty? Ka’r, lord of whatever? Ka’r the magnificent? You really should take a look at the handbook.”
~
“Either one of your neighbors is possessed or there’s a dead chick in the yard,” Dean said, completely deadpan. “Neither is good.”
“We don’t have any neighbors,” Annie replied breathlessly.
“Well, that answers that.”
~
“Post hole,” he grit his teeth. “Didn’t see it.”
“Yeah, I guessed that,” Sam muttered. “It was kind of a clue when you tried to beat the dirt into submission with your face.”
~
“Probably won’t do anything, but you never know,” Bobby shrugs. “I always subscribe to the ‘Can’t Hurt, Might Help’ school of thought.”
~ “What did she look like?”
“I don’t know,” Dean snapped. “She was too busy trying to carve out my brain.”
~
“Are you boys really this stupid?”
“Is that a rhetorical question or are you expecting an outright denial?” Dean asked.
“I guess that answers my question.” 
~
“You can wait by your vehicles…,” he said. They looked collectively humiliated. “Actually, I don’t want you here listening to me puke.”
“Speaking of, the puddle next to the stairs here is from Lykken. It’s not evidential to the case.”
“Noted.”
~
In his mind, John sees his boys with guns in their hands with smooth, comfortable lines to them that flow from wrist to barrel, like the damn things grow from their skin and listen to their wordless commands, and somehow that makes him sleep better at night.
~ "Does yours do that thing when it's all quiet where he starts singing under his breath, and then he gets louder and louder, and then when you say something about it, he's like, 'No, no, I have no idea what you're talking about!' and then he insists he never does it?" "All the time! And does yours do the little dance, too?" Rose asked, bouncing a little. "Oh my God, the dance!” Martha squealed, and then they both broke into a strange little dance that was mainly tiny arm flails combined with an odd sort of shake to their heads. Despite the fact that they'd only met a few hours ago, their dance was perfectly in time.
~ “If you’re going to lie to me have the decency to be convincing.”
~ “Run like hell is not the default battle plan.” “Uh, just to be clear, I shot first, then ran like hell.”
~
“You know why I like Indiana so much?” Dean asked.
Sam only raised an eyebrow in response.
“It’s the scenery. It’s always changing. Sometimes the corn’s on the left. Sometimes it’s on the right.”
~ “Exactly,” Dean said, looking almost panicked that the man was going to explain further. Sam knew neither of them was going to be able to keep a straight face if he kept it up.
~ Tom came to with a gasp, dragging in great gulps of air. He took one look at Dean and then promptly passed out again.
“I’m going to try not to take that personally,” Dean frowned and sat back heavily.
~ “You are avenging angels,” Joe said. “You were sent here to help me.”
“Hold on there, buddy,” Dean said, looking stunned. “I’m pretty sure every preacher in town just sat up and said, ‘heck, no.’”
~ “I said don’t touch him, Joe. I wasn’t kidding,” Dean’s voice was calm and even. It was a standing family rule. Try not to yell at the ghosts. It made them cranky. Sam was just surprised that Dean was sticking to it. That was normally rule number one to go.
~
“Ok, quick recap,” Dean said. “This is Joe, the guy who supposedly disappeared your senior year of High School. Only he didn’t really disappear. Simon here,” Dean pointed helpfully with his flashlight, “locked him in a silo so he could put the moves on you. Joe died,” he moved the beam of light to Joe, “and instead of owning up to it, Simon here,” back to Simon, “buried him out in the field and never told anyone. Insult to injury, putting the moves on you seems to have worked, since you two are married. Joe’s ticked now and he’s possessed our nice sci-fi geek friend, Tom. Note the freaky, glowy eyes.”
~ “Just don’t blame your hair on me,” he said. “I tried to take you to the barber.”
Sam snorted. “You threatened to shoot me if I didn’t go. That one time you even went armed. You were like the opposite of a bodyguard.”
~
“The good news is that the gas station coffee is actually pretty good. The bad news is that you made the front page of the paper.” ~ “He’s on the floor,” Dean answered. “And either he’s dead or he’s doing a really thorough inspection of the carpet.”
~ “Sorry,” Dean growled, his voice still perfectly calm. “I have a no touching rule. Maybe I should have warned you about that earlier. But to answer your question, this is your fault because you murdered…” Dean looked up at Sam frowning, “What was his name?”
“Andre,” Sam provided.
~ “Sam, why is it that I save ‘em and they’re always thanking you?” Dean asked.
Sam raised an eyebrow, still rocking the oblivious woman. “It couldn’t possibly be your prickly personality.”
“Prickly?” Dean snorted. “Dude, who uses a word like prickly?”
“Exhibit A,” Sam said dryly.
Dean shook his head. “It’s probably the hair. It’s soothing. Reminds them of their mother.”
“Exhibit B.”
~ “Hello, Peter,” Dean said distantly. “I should have realized it was you.” Sam’s eyes widened. Not Dean. Definitely not Dean. His brother didn’t sound like that. Dean was a lot of things. But this cool, smooth-faced indifference to what was happening...
~ “I hate being possessed,” Dean muttered and promptly passed out.
~ “Remind me why I’m here again?” Dean whispered.
“Cause you’re a humanitarian,” Sam answered, barely paying attention to him.
“That’s funny. I’m pretty sure you called me an anti-social bastard just yesterday.” Dean held his breath and swung around a corner.
“Fine. You’re a closet humanitarian.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“An anti-social bastard who helps people he can’t stand. Now shut up or it’ll hear us,” Sam snapped.
“Like it matters. It can smell us before we get within 200 yards,” Dean said, pausing while he glanced into one of the open doors.
~ Dean blinked in surprise. Everyone knew you didn’t ask someone to hand you the gun. It was way too easy for them to shoot you while they ‘handed’ it to you. You asked them to put it on the ground and back away from it. It was in the how-to-disarm-your-opponent handbook. Dean was sure of it.
~ Dean knew he should say something. Tell Sam it was all right. That it had been an accident.
“So,” Dean cleared his suddenly dry throat. “Something tells me we need to go over those gun safety rules again.”
~
“Sammy, you shoot me on purpose?”
“No!” Sam said, horrified. “I…”
“Then why are you sorry?” Dean asked, annoyed at how breathy and rough-voiced he sounded.
“I didn’t mean to…” Sam trailed off. He looked grief-stricken, stunned, frozen.
“Dude, how about you not let me bleed to death and we’ll call it even,” Dean offered weakly.
~ “None of that,” Doug said and in an instant the four men stood down, obeying him as if it were automatic.
~
“Why break with tradition now? We fumble around, nearly get killed and then figure it out,” he shrugged. “It’s what we do.”
~
“Jail is mostly concrete,” the mayor answered irritably. “Wouldn’t burn.”
~ “Fine,” Dean ground out. “So much for trying to be polite. You clubbed the polite brother. I’m the angry bastard.” ~ Dean leaned over him so he could study his face. “How many fingers am I holding up?”
Sam blinked owlishly. “Fourteen or fifteen.” He blinked again in confusion. “It’d be easier to tell if you’d quit moving them around.”
“And it’d be easier to tell if you were actually looking at my hand,” Dean observed. “That’s my nose, dude.”
“Then in that case, only one.”
~ Dean might have believed him if Sam’s voice hadn’t sounded like a six year old trying to be brave.
~
“We got it, already,” Dean yelled. “What is it with the ghosts and the repetition? I take it Pete blames you?” Dean said unnecessarily.
~
“Why would he blame your whole family?” Sam asked in confusion.
“Because he’s a bastard!” Bob shouted.
“I think we know that,” Dean snapped. “It kind of goes along with taking a girl on a con job and getting her killed.”
The mayor rolled his eyes. “Not that kind, you half-wit.”
~
“I would like to take this opportunity to say that we are in no way affiliated with law enforcement,” Dean said. The ghost cocked its head to one side, matching Dean. Sam grimaced worriedly as his brother’s smirk appeared. “Not. Guards,” he said as if talking to an idiot.
~ “I’m fine, too,” Sam said quickly. “Nothing that hasn’t happened before.”
“You’ve been hit in the head with a shovel?” Dean raised an eyebrow.
“Peoria.”
Dean smiled involuntarily. “Oh, yeah. The deranged yak looking thing.”
“Glad to see you’re just as sympathetic now as you were then,” Sam said, pursing his lips.
~ “And apparently, I’m uncouth, whatever that is. I think I should put it on my business cards. Sounds cool.”
~ “Can we call you a tow truck?” Sam asked, using his own version of the voice, but she shook her head.
“I’d prefer Hannah actually.”
~ “Do I look stupid, kid?”
Dean blinked and couldn’t help a grin from forming. “Ya know, you really shouldn’t give people an opening like that.”
~
“Hello, Mrs. Mueller? This is Deputy Timmons with the Sheriff’s Department. I’m calling because we received a report of two suspicious looking men taking your car from your home.” He paused, listening for several seconds. “Sam?” Dean pointed helpfully toward his brother. “And Dean?” Dean pointed a thumb at his own chest.
~ “Stop giving Kane the eye, kid,” Deputy Timmons said. “Your brother’s already done it plenty.”
“Sam? He couldn’t give a kindergartner the eye.” Sam joined them and glared at Dean to show him just how capable he was.
“See?” Dean pointed. “Would you be afraid of that?”
~ “I still can’t believe you made me go on a cave tour,” Dean grumbled.
“You could have stayed in the car,” Sam replied.
Dean waved his hand at the dark expanse of cave around them. “And miss all of this damp, moldy fun?”
~ “You kept saying ‘have to save her’. You tried to get out the door and when I wouldn’t let you leave we had a… difference of opinion.”
“I punched you?” Sam said.
“That too.” 
~ “I’m on the ground again,” Sam observed, exhaustion in his voice.
“It was kind of necessary.”
“You’re sitting on me.”
“Also necessary.” He rolled so that he was sitting beside him. “Dude, if I ever give you another gym membership, just shoot me,” he said.
“You told me that was against the rules,” Sam said, his voice oddly hoarse, almost as if from disuse. “No shooting Dean. That’s the rule.” He rolled onto his side, grunting with the effort, then looked up. “You’re bleeding.”
Dean put his hand to his head and hissed. “You hit me with the tray.”
“Sorry,” Sam said simply.
“Dude, who uses a tray? I mean honestly?”
~
“Yeah, well, Sam and I’ve got matching tattoos. I won’t tell you where, but if we make it through this, I’ll show you.”
Kinirsky laughed. “Sometimes I’m glad I can’t see.”
~ “We… Uhh…” He shifted uncomfortably, chagrinned. “Yeah, I got nothin’.”
~
“After Auntie Annie accidentally pushed Grandpa Nigel out the window during a fight over who got to be my namesake, Mum just decided to name me after all our female relatives. Plus Grandpa,” she added after a short pause, “to cheer him up, ‘cause he broke his leg.”
~
The President turned to the General with a grin on his face, “Jack, stay out of trouble. I mean it.”
“You wound me, Sir. I haven’t been nearly killed in at least two months,” the General replied.
~ “Why Cassandra Frasier, I am shocked and appalled that you would think I could abuse my rank in such a manner…” Jack started.
Daniel slyly interrupted, “Says the man who declared that every Wednesday should now be Double Fudge Brownie Wednesday. The same man who told security that anyone caught parking in his spot was, and I quote, to be shot on sight and then brought in for questioning.”
~
“I am not missing. I know exactly where I am…” he yelled into the phone.
~ He'd have thought she was sleeping, but he’d seen enough corpses to know the way all muscle tension left them.
~
The mystery of who kept stealing your newspaper. Answer: me! The mystery of what we're doing this weekend. Hint: it involves dragsters.
~
“What's your dental plan?”
“Don't get cavities.”
“Health plan?”
“Same, but with hepatitis and shingles.”
~
I'm never doing anything blindly with you again, I learned that at the Mexican border. Twice.
~
“You named your fake detective agency Psych? Why didn't you just call it 'Hey, we're fooling you and the police department; hope we don't make a mistake and somebody dies because of it'?” 
“First of all, Gus, that name is entirely too long; it would never fit on the window.”
~ Proudly, I have never heard of any of these words. I file these words under 'What to say when I want to be ridiculed or kicked out of bed'.
~
“His responses to my interrogation were hostile at best.”
“Clarify hostile.”
“Use my tone now as a guide.”
~ No, no, no...that’s only if we break something and then enter something. Entering is just entering.
~
“No, Maggie,” he said, in what struck him as a commendably even tone. “We were not there two minutes ago, and we are not there now.”
~
“It hurts that badly?” He asked, panicking a little bit because he’s not like a doctor or anything but he’s pretty sure paper cuts are supposed to sting like the devil but not cause abrupt explosions of inconsolable tears.
~
Clark’s grin was markedly unrepentant as he explained, “He’s missed you. We discussed the issue, and we decided that there’s no way you can be allowed to spend the entire holiday by yourself. So we thought we’d come by to see how you’re doing.”
“And this whole time, you weren’t in the least bit concerned about the fact that you were conducting a two-way conversation with a dog?”
“I’m gifted,” he replied happily.
~
His eyes watered as the vaguely eggnog-flavored rum seared its way down his throat.
~ Then, she threw him a suspicious look. “You do know you're dancing, right?” she asked, as if it could have passed his attention.
“You know, it’s moments like this that make it hard to believe people have accused you before of not grasping the astonishingly obvious.”
~ She was in the kitchen, muttering softly, to no one in general, “Please don’t burn. I am actually begging you not to burn on me!”
~
He knew he had only a matter of seconds before her amazement faded into what stood a good chance to be unholy wrath.
~
She was a prefect. Or, as he’d preferred to think of it at the time, an untouchable, unreachable goddess.
~
He put his chin on his palm and beamed at her, giving Lana the annoying feeling that he knew perfectly well how irresistible he looked.
~
“Responsible seventeen-year-old girls don’t sneak into bars with fake IDs and make their grocery money playing pool against guys who can’t play in the presence of underage cleavage.”
~
She cleared her throat and said, “Ladies, this is Richard White. He’s…”
“I’m Lana’s boy-toy,” Richard said, sliding his arm around her waist and beaming.
“Richard!” Lana turned to look at him, blushing, utterly scandalized, and just a bit delighted…
“Well? My own paper printed it, so it must be true.”
~ “I’m a guy,” he replied. “I don’t buy clothes for women. It’s like asking a snake to buy shoes – we don’t get it.”
~
“Richard White! That was the least romantic proposal I’ve ever heard. ‘Let’s go find an all-night jewellery store.’ Honestly!”
~
“You don’t want to go all the way just to get attacked by a snarling, yapping menace that wants nothing more than to chew your leg off.”
“And her dogs are murder, too,” Lois interjected, completely deadpan. There was one beat of silence, followed by a lot of snickering.
~
“Everything in the break room fridge gets stolen… Then again, if any normal human tries to eat this stuff, it’ll probably melt their brain. 
If it sits here any longer, it may eat the desk. I’m dropping this in the fridge – if anyone leaves early because their mouth caught fire, 
we’ve caught our lunch bandit.”
~
“Like the time the power had failed and the party was held by the light of thirty laptop computers…”
