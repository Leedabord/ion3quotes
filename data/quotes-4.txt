“Are you talking about me?” Rodney demanded. Sheppard threw a power bar wrapper at him. 
“Yes, McKay. We have a secret code. When we say ‘Bates,’ ‘Wraith,’ or ‘Surface-to-Air-Missile,’ we actually mean you.”
~
“That is the stupidest thing you’ve ever said,” Rodney hissed, “because if there was ever, ever, a situation that called for panic—”
~ 
“We are accustomed to differences among our people,” Teyla assured her gently.
“Really,” Rodney muttered, mostly absorbed in taking energy readings. “I don’t recall any incompetent transvestites with head injuries in our little community. Of course, there’s Dr. Pierce in Biology, but I certainly wouldn’t call him incompetent—” John said, equally low-voiced, “If you screw this up by insulting someone, I’m going to give you a head injury.” Rodney snorted in annoyance. “Please, my head is too valuable and you know it. Threaten something else if you want to be convincing.” Before John could move on to a better threat, Ford leaned in to ask incredulously, “Dr. Pierce is a man? Are you serious?” and the incident was forgotten.
~ Anoch, the male village elder, showed them around a bit, and John relied heavily on Ford’s ability to say things like “That’s a really nice plough,” with a straight face.
~
“Look at it from my perspective,” Rodney said, “Now that I’ve seen your underwear, my fantasies will be much more accurate.”
“There is more lace than I’d always pictured,” John admitted.
“I will make you rue that comment later, Dr. McKay. And you, Major,” Teyla eyed John critically; “I look forward to our next sparring session. Now help me find my shirt and tell me what has happened.”
~ “You people just lead lives of quiet desperation, don’t you? I’ve been a fugitive for six hundred years and I’m not that cynical.” “Then you’re doing it wrong,” Rodney told him.
~
“We could only blow it up with a naquadah bomb, and that might be problematic, in the ‘planet go boom’ sense of problematic.”
~ Teyla shook her head at them all, smiling in the way that meant “you are all very silly people, but I love you anyway.”
~ Of course he’s crazy. Of all the things you could use a Quantum Mirror for, kidnapping someone from another universe had to be at the top of the Plans Only Insane People Would Seriously Consider list.
~ Keeping his voice low and emphatic, John said into his ear, “Look, Skippy, you didn’t shoot us when you had the chance, so I’m going to do you a favour. Instead of putting a bullet in your leg and then asking you questions, I’m just going to beat the crap out of you until you tell me what I want to know.” Fake Rodney’s voice came out an octave higher. “Or I could just tell you now.”
~ Rodney glanced up, did a double-take, and went white, his eyes widening. In a low choked voice, he said, “They told me you were dead.” “They lie a lot. Come on.”
~ Then Rodney said stiffly, “Before you get too set on trading up, you should know I activated the city’s self destruct. You have twenty minutes before the naquadah generators explode, causing a chain reaction which should destabilize the naquadah in both the stargate and the Quantum Mirror.” As if that wasn’t plain enough, he added, “This city is going to be in lots of little pieces.” Startled, John stared at him. “Seriously?”
“Yes.” Rodney lifted his chin. “That’s the issue I mentioned. It bothered me a little for a minute there, but I’m over it now.” Weir stared at them, incredulous and still amused. “We don’t have a self-destruct.” Rodney assured her, “You do now.” The amusement changed to impatience. “The computer we gave you didn’t have access to our system—” Rodney snorted. “Please. I used it to initialize and activate the Ancient network, then hacked your system from there.”
~ “You could have said something,” John pointed out, exasperated.  “When? During the frantic running and shooting?”
~ “You can’t honestly be this boring. So you’ve got to be hiding something.” 
“Nice leap in logic.” 
~ “I can hear you thinking from here,” says Dean, waving a strip of bacon instructively. Dean’s apparently decided to have two plates of breakfast this morning, and Sam feels nauseous just looking at it. “It’s not good for people to think as much as you do. By the time you hit thirty your brain’ll explode.”
~ Sam’s voice is hoarse and his tongue hurts from too much Latin, but Dean’s still just sitting there in the middle of the circle of salt. Dean started off looking freaked, then he looked bored, and now he looks like he’s trying not to laugh.
~ Sam stopped and turned, pinning him with a look. “How could it possibly have been worse?” he asked, incredulous. Dean opened his mouth and worked it for a moment; Sam just rolled his eyes. He snapped his fingers in triumph: “She could have poured the gasoline on us. You know, instead of just leading up to us. Then we’d really be hurting.” “Wall of fire! Coming at my head!”
~ “Hey, if you didn’t want me to be stubborn and irrational, you shouldn’t have made me pregnant.”
~
“Your mom? Your mom taught you to be a diehard survivalist in a post nuclear war zone?”
Connor spread his hands. “I know; what possible use could I have for any of that?”
~ Oh, God. No party was worth this hangover. Dean shook his head gingerly, feeling his brain slosh around inside his skull. It cleared his senses a little, though, enough that his position started to register. And his lack of clothing above the waist. And the ropes. Awesome.
~ “For an hour, I sit in this booth where people come along and pay money to throw balls at a target. If you hit the target, I fall into a vat of…who knows what. They want to surprise us.”
~ “Do you think I could make you avoid boys until you’re forty?” he asked his daughter, mock-seriously.
She shook her head immediately. “I like boys already.”
~
“You have about as much chance of going out with Penny as the Hubble Telescope has of finding that at the centre of each black hole there’s a little man with a flashlight trying to find the circuit breaker.”
~
“Oh, well, this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.”
~
“Oh, I’m sorry. Did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?”
~
“There wouldn’t have been any ass kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.”
~
“I’ve spent the past three-and-a-half years staring at grease boards full of equations; before that, I spent four years working on my thesis; before that, I was in college; and before that, I was in the fifth grade.”
~
“Look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics–the sign’s been changed! Doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having?”
“Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you–hey, look, that fixes the problem I’ve been having!”
~
“You have a TV in your room; why don’t you just have breakfast in bed?”
“Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day.”
~
“I don’t know how, but she is cheating! Nobody can be that attractive and this good at a videogame.”
~
“Wait, Sheldon. Come back. You forgot something…this plasma grenade. Hey look, it’s raining you.”
~
“We tried kissing but the earth didn’t move. I mean any more than the 383 miles it was going to move anyway.”
~
“Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn’t, would you want me to tell you?”
“That depends. When I learn that I’m a robot, will I be able to handle it?”
“Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your side.”
“Uh, let me ask you this: when I learn that I’m a robot, will I be bound by Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics?”
“You might be bound by them right now.”
“That’s true, have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction, allowed a human being to come to harm?”
“Of course not.”
“Have you ever harmed yourself or let yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would’ve been endangered?”
“Well, no.”
“I smell robot.”
“What’s going on around here?”
“The internet’s been down for half an hour. Also, Sheldon might be a robot.”
~
“Do those sound like castanets to you?”
“The box says “kitchen.”“
“So? Do cocaine smugglers write “cocaine” on the box?”
~ “Yes well, I’m polymerized tree sap and you’re an inorganic adhesive, so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns to its original trajectory and adheres to you.”
~
“Hi, I’m the small package good things come in.”
~
“I’m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it’s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.”

“You know, I’ve given the matter some thought, and I think I’d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.”

“It’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and—as it always has—rock crushes scissors”

“I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion”

“I am not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I’ve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.”
~
“You don’t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a super villain.”
~
“Oh, I can’t take the bus anymore. They don’t have seatbelts, and they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.”
~
“If it’s the things you love that make you who you are. I guess that makes me large breasts.”
~
“Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.”
“I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own. In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux with that very time machine. In Back to the future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.”
“Those are movies.”
“Of course they’re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real-life time machine? That’s absurd.”
~
“I want to go back and keep myself from buying this ridiculous time machine.”
“You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present - travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.”
“Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?”
“Same paradox—if you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.”
“What if I knocked you unconscious right now?”
~
“You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.”
“Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years and that there’d be an asterisk next to his name because he’d be a cyborg.”
~
“Do you have any idea what time it is?”
“Of course I do, my watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It’s accurate to one-tenth of a second, but as I’m saying this it occurs to me once again your question may have been rhetorical.”
~
“Leonard, please don’t take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassels on flying carpets.”
~
“Well, there’s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam’s Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.”
~
“I didn’t know you played the cello.”
“Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough.”
~
“Well, you did call him a “glorified high school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.”“
“In my defence, I prefaced that with, “with all due respect.”“
~
“I just gave you a reasonable explanation.”
“No, no. You gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.”
~
“You did not break-up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.”
“To mend her broken heart!”
~
“Also, I am given to understand that your mother is overweight. Oh, snap. Now of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony then I withdraw that comment.”
~
“Way to think outside, but press right up against the box, Sheldon.”
~
“I’ve calculated that there are 487 potential partners for us within a 20 mile radius. I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.”
~
“Go to the comic book store and just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we could pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size? Or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude? Or pick out his breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feeling about little marshmallows?”
“Spiderman. Get him Spiderman.”
“Amazing Spiderman? Ultimate Spiderman? Spectacular Spiderman? Sensational Spiderman? Spiderman 2099?”
~
“A superb choice…provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52 and is familiar with the reestablishment of the DC multiverse.”
~
“Blink twice if you’re here against your will.”
~
“Just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdoes. Stuart’s an architect.”
“Ok, what about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?”
“Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make.”
~
“Very wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.”
“Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say a tomato’s a vegetable. It’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge.”
~
“Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’etre.”
“You can throw all the French around you want, it doesn’t make you right.”
“Au contraire.”

“Don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when to hunt.”
“Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.”

Susan: “He promised me that if we were old and both not married, we’d get married and have cats.”
~ I should just throw caution to the wind and write a book about an alcoholic lesbian ninja gunslinger with superpowers who hangs out with the ghosts of pirates, rides a dinosaur, and fights zombies.

~ The Flaming Box of Fiery Doom: In which Gerard is a magician, Bob is his assistant who refuses to wear sequins, Mickey builds contraptions that don’t usually kill people, and there is Terrible Danger from rival magicians with Nefarious Plans. “Bob didn’t actually know that he was applying to be a magician’s assistant.”
~ Parallaxverse: In which everyone is in space and some people are cyborgs.
~ I’m trying to get me some exercise. Hey, I have cable, and on cable comes FitTV. So why not utilize it? This is my second day and yesterday I felt pretty good afterward. Of course, I didn’t actually do all the exercises that Gilad was doing, but what can you expect? I’m totally out of shape and Gilad works out four times a day. Also felt like a complete moron doing the moves, but I was in my underwear (yes I exercise in my undies!) so that kinda helped. How, you ask? Because I already felt ridiculous just hanging around in my undies for no reason, so what’s a few lame dance moves? Anyway, we’re on day 2, and I thought of a brilliant idea. How about an overweight exercise teacher? Seriously! I can’t keep up with the fitness gurus; I haven’t exercised since freshman year of college! So I feel like a fat slob trying to follow Gilad through fifteen reps of 150 ab-destroying crunches. What I want is a fat guy up there panting along with me! Someone who can’t do the Pilates positions because his gut gets in the way. Someone with horrible balance like mine. When I get better at things, then I’ll go see Gilad. But to start with, give me John Goodman! As an aside, how great would it be to work out with John Goodman? He’d be all “Yeah, this one’s too hard. Let’s just walk in place, ok? That’s easy enough.”
~ Christianity: The belief that life and all of the universe is a gift from an imaginary magic spirit who lives in space and is angry at all humans because a woman he made of spare ribs was talked into eating the fruit from a magic tree by a talking snake. This is the same magic spirit who later came down and impregnated a virgin so he could have a son who would be killed and turned into a zombie. This was so that people could eat the meat and drink the blood from his zombie body and be saved from the stigma of what that rib-woman did by eating the magic fruit that made the magic spirit mad in the first place. Only by eating this magic zombie flesh and blood, and telepathically pledging their lives to him, can the descendants of the spare-rib woman be forgiven and follow his son whom he sent to save them from himself.
~ I’ve got one of those Ten Plagues Stuffed Toy Sets and I never made sure they were all there. They’ve gotten spilled all over my floor and I was gathering them up. There’s seven. And a Batman antenna topper. I don’t think Batman was one of the plagues. Then they would have just needed one. Maybe I’ll improvise. I’m missing frogs, pestilence, and hail. My leopard print rubber ducky can stand in for the frogs. Pestilence can be...um...a My Little Pony or Wolverine? Or my pen with a shiny skull surrounded by black foofoo stuff. That’d work. NO WAIT! CTHULHU! Cthulhu can be two plagues! Darkness is now black Cthulhu. Green Cthulhu is locusts. Which I also don’t have. Wait. How do I have 7 of 10 and I’m missing four? Is the cow supposed to be Pestilence? Yeah, it is. I suck at this.
~ If you give Claire a Venti coffee, she will try to find a place to put it on her desk. Realizing she has no room on her desk, she will clear away a spot for the coffee by throwing a good portion of garbage away. Some of it will fall on the floor as she brings it to the garbage can on the other side of her room. As she stoops to pick up the garbage, she will notice that there is an awful lot of stuff cluttering up the floor. After hanging up her clean clothes, starting a fresh load of laundry, and putting all her College books away, she will focus on the coat of grime sitting on the floor. Disgusted with her lack of personal hygiene – and realizing that all this dust and particles on the floor can not be helping her allergies – she finds the vacuum and furiously cleans the floor. To see if she got it all, Claire will open the blinds of her window, and will see that there is a spider colony situated in between the shutters and the window itself. Quickly, she will vacuum up the webs, and get a shot of fear through her veins, when she thinks of what might have just fallen onto her bed. She will rush to go get clean sheets, but stops at the sink in the bathroom to rid her hands of the spider stuff with a hefty amount of soap. While washing her hands, she spots all the water gunk and grossness all over the bathroom counter and mirror. Hurriedly, she will scrub and scour the hell out of the little room. After, she will wash her hands thoroughly, and remember that she needed clean sheets. When she finishes making the bed, Claire will flop down on it, sleepily, needing a quick boost of energy. That is when she remembers that she has a cold Venti cup of powerful coffee…
~ And if you feel the need to shoot several people along with shooting yourself, could you please shoot yourself first? That way, if you like it you can share, and if you don’t like it you’ll know to stop before you commit a faux pas. It’s like sampling the appetizers before you send the plate out. Just common courtesy.

Will that convince you?”
~ 3:20 pm: Walk to bus stop. 3:25 pm: Walk past bus stop because I have glimpsed a pub that claims to have something called Terminator Stout, and if there’s a combination out there between beer and killer robots, I need it right now.
~ My debit cards are, evidently, made in Outer Mongolia, on a machine that only works on days when it can be powered by the divine light of the full moon. It is then shipped by camel to Uttar Pradesh, where it’s lost for six days.

“I have a logical explanation,” I said, which was true, for a given local value of logic.  “You always do,” he muttered, and went and got a hammer, which he was careful not to hand to me. “Now, what do you want me to do with this?”
“I need a chunk of rock small enough to fit into a shot glass.” There was a brief moment while I could see him trying and discarding hypotheses, moving past “art project,” lingering briefly on “unusual mixed drink,” and then finally settling on “probably something involving the fish tank.”
~
On the other hand, this was coming from a big black woman, and I don’t mean “big” as a euphemism for “fat.” She was a good six feet tall and built to scale, and although she was probably upwards of two hundred pounds, the impression was less of obesity and more of an Amazon experiencing some slight middle-age spread.
~
Me: “So, people go to Castro to stare at the gay people making out?”
Kari: “Because the gay people feel more comfortable making out there… because people aren’t staring at them.” ~ Mt. Fuji was formed when he piled up all the bodies of his enemies. What you call ‘orbit’ is actually the force of his charisma drawing objects closer at the same time as he intimidates them away. You do not have a girlfriend; you have a woman he hasn’t met yet. Jail is where they put criminals to be safe from him. He makes his tea by first chopping the water from the tea leaves, then boiling the water with an angry stare. Technically, he does not cut anything— reality simply gives way to his sword.
~ Also, I want to see Titus Andronicus, because that is not Shakespeare crossing the line. That is Shakespeare jumping the line and twelve school buses on a flaming motorcycle in a studded leather jacket while flipping off the audience with one hand and biting the head off of a chicken with the other.
~ Meat is murder!...Sweet, yummy, delicious murder, full of tender succulent homicide and dripping with greasy slaughter! Served hot and cruel with a side-order of bloodbath on carnage. Fuck, I’m hungry.
~ I wasn’t actually aware that there were so many jokes about chicken bestiality that could be made. I know better now. I also wasn’t aware that I could personally come up with as many of those jokes as I did. But, as it turns out, you need to make them for a while before you actually get to “Which came first, the chicken or the carnival barker?” It’s not a matter of thinking of that one up since it’s fairly obvious. It’s a matter of getting yourself to a point where you’ve lost all shame already anyway, so you might as well say it.
~ “What is the most difficult book I’ve ever read? Probably Harry Potter y el Prisionero de Azkaban. For obvious reasons.”
~ “Mould demons,” I confirmed, impressed, as I folded myself into the driver’s side and turned the key in the ignition. “You know, you’re the first person that’s guessed that right away.”
~ Dean heaved a sigh. “Is this going to be like that time I put lemon juice in your breakfast cereal, and you spent the next week switching cups with me and then waiting for me to take a drink before you would?”
~ “Spin around widdershins three times,” Sam said. Dean turned to look at him silently. “It’s true!”
“Give me that,” Dean snapped, snatching the papers off him.
~ “Wolves are awesome, admit it. Loyal and true and beautiful – look at her – and can rip your throat out in a minute.”
“It explains a lot about you, this little monologue,” Sam said. Dean just grinned. Wolfishly.
~
“It looks kinda unstable,” Sam said doubtfully, flashlight beam dancing over the rotting wooden doors, the crumbling stone. 
“So does my sanity right now,” Dean said out loud. “We’re going in. Will you come with us?” This last, quite politely, to the wolf. She lay down. “But you’ll wait for us.” Brief movement of that bushy tail. She was too dignified for Dean to call it a wag.
~ Sam cleared his throat. “Stop at the next barn you come to,” he read. “Enter through the window in the back; there is a ladder there. Defeat the occupants and force their leader to tell you his secret.” The silence that filled the Impala after that was thick as treacle. 
Finally, Dean sighed. “Better get the machetes,” he said.
~ Susan: “He agreed that you look good. You have man-approval!”
~
“What does Google Maps say?” Dean asked, trying and failing to keep the sarcasm to a minimum. Sam consulted with the cursed papers by the glow of the headlights. His mouth twisted into weird and wonderful shapes as he did so, inventing whole new aspects of the Bitchface. Finally, he looked up and sighed. “I’m not going to like it?” Dean said. He had a foot inside the car, leaning on the driver’s door. Elbow on the roof, fingers tapping on the metal. Sam shrugged resignedly. Dean gestured at him to get on with it.
“Knock three times on the farmhouse door, wait one minute exactly, and then knock twice more,” Sam read. “Jake will open the door to you. If you show him the key, he’ll put you up for the night; if you tell him the password, he’ll tell you how to continue.”
“Will he, perchance, do both?” Dean asked.
Sam shrugged again. “We could ask,” he said.
They did so. Jake shook his head regretfully. “Sorry, fellas. One or the other.”
~ Hermione, on the other hand, kept insisting that it was already mid-March and she hadn’t caused a time paradox yet, which meant that she had to be worthy.
~ Amazingly enough, that threat had actually worked. The rat gave one last terrified squeal and subsided. Harry halted his steps to stare at the rodent: did he speak some other animal language, like the rat equivalent of Parseltongue? Because this was kind of disturbing.
~ He left without waiting for permission. Finding an unused classroom and hexing everything inside it to smithereens seemed like an exceedingly good idea at the moment.
~ “Hey, history is interesting!” Blaise protested. Everyone stared at him; even Hermione looked sceptical. “Well, not the way Binns tells it, but it really is. You’re just a bunch of illiterate morons.” Hermione made an indignant noise, but it drowned in the cacophony of arguments. Neville was saying something about his Gran and interest in Herbology, Padma was claiming a long string of very literate Ravenclaws in her ancestry, and Millie was explaining why Blaise would die alone and eaten by werewolves.
~
“Heads or tails? It’s to see who speaks first,” Jessie explained, in roughly the same tone my mother uses when she ‘explains’ the need to do dishes or de-gnome the garden.
~
“Now: whether or not it is plausible—indeed, the less plausible the better, perhaps—you will find a way to blame Harry for what has occurred. You will be quite vicious, even for you. Take as many points as you like, I will find a way of returning them later.” Dumbledore’s eyes grow distant, considering. “A few detentions may be in order as well. And a great deal of ranting. The ranting is quite the material point. Nobody observing you should be left in the slightest doubt of your feelings for Harry. You have free reign to be quite as unpleasant as you possibly can.”
Snape blinks at him, feeling as though the world has shifted on its axis. “You do realize,” he says, “that my birthday is not until January.”
~
“Ah.” Dumbledore clears his throat. “As it happens, Vernon Dursley did not return to Surrey.”
“No?” Snape arches an eyebrow, not daring to say more.
“No.” Dumbledore refills his tea cup. “He is in the hospital wing.” Snape blinks at the Headmaster, and it is only with the utmost effort he prevents his jaw from dropping. Dumbledore stirs his tea, a perfectly neutral expression on his face, but Snape can just catch a glimpse of something fierce in his eyes.
Well, if Dursley had provoked Dumbledore sufficiently to land himself in the hospital wing, there is only one logical question to ask. “Is he still alive?”
~
Harry wrinkles his nose. “Snape’s been weird. Twitchy. Like I’m about to turn a corner and get killed by Voldemort at any moment.”
Hermione arches an eyebrow at him. “Oh?” she says sweetly. “You mean ‘protective’?”
Harry flushes, and Ron shudders. “I like Harry’s word better,” he says, pushing his plate back too, as though his appetite has suddenly vanished.
~ “I realize that your powers of textual analysis are limited,” Snape says, and Harry can already tell this isn’t going to be a real answer to his question, “but did it entirely escape your notice that in that letter, your uncle issued a credible threat to betray you to the Dark Lord at the first opportunity?”
Harry blinks at him. “Well, no, not really.” At Snape’s irritated expression, he adds, “I mean, yeah, I know he said that, but...he calls him ‘Lord Whatsit’, so I didn’t think there was any point taking him seriously. I mean, I don’t really see Uncle Vernon popping round to the Malfoys’ to plot my death over tea and biscuits, do you?”
~ “It is not a foregone conclusion that death and destruction will follow you wherever you go.”
Harry snorts, and looks away again. “Say that again with a straight face.”
~
“I have written many letters of this nature to the parents of my students over the course of my tenure as Headmaster, and after a great deal of trial and error I have come to believe that the best way to prevent unnecessary anxiety over the sort of news I must give you is to begin by wasting a moment of your time with a long-winded sentence that says very little about anything in particular. This is because I am sure you will realize that if I had anything terribly dire to relate, I should not be so unkind as to draw the experience out in such a way.”
~
“He’s right, I remember that. Ginny kept giving you a hard time for the phrase ‘alerted peril’ while Terry kept insisting ‘hereguarded’ wasn’t a word.”
~ “Did you insult Phineas? He’s rather,” he searched for the word, “…pouty. Hermione kept encouraging him, while he’s wailing about ‘miscreants’ and ‘unfair treatment’. Needless to say, he won’t talk to you.”
~ Thanks to fortune cookies, he now owns 127 pieces of Confucian advice, none of which will help him save the world from the machines.
~
“Why’reyoucarryingme?” To John’s ears, his words sound slurred. That’s wrong, he thinks. Future leaders of mankind should sound crisp and authoritative and something that he can’t remember. His brain doesn’t seem to be working right. He hopes he didn’t say that out loud.
~ “You might mess up your dress,” Morris protests, but only feebly, because hey, she might know how to fix it, and he’s pretty sure he actually doesn’t.
~ The Wonder Woman Foundation was a massive charitable organisation founded and run by the most charismatic and influential female of all time. One of their most visible branches was Women’s Shelters: direct line to the police, medical staff on 24 hour standby, permanent rotating councillors on staff, and armed Amazons who were an order away from exterminating every living thing with external genitalia.

Also, this Phantom was much more Murder! Doom! Mayhem! I’m really kind of crazy! than others I’ve seen, who’ve been more of the hey baby hey baby let’s make music together ooo ooo music variety.

“Apparently, actual pirates are back. So, good news for fans of scurvy. Bad news for those who copy movies and music illegally; you must now go back to your original rank: thieves.”

“Now, the freighter was seized off the coast of Somalis while it was carrying, I kid you not, donated relief food for starving Africans…Quick word of advice for aspiring modern-day Robin Hoods out there. Um, stealing from the poor to give to genocidal war lords in charge of child armies doesn’t have the folk-hero ring you might be looking for. I don’t see a Disney movie in your future.”
~ The woman known collectively as, ‘Oh Merlin, it’s her – run!’ smiled brightly at the two of them.
~ “Sirius,” Remus said lightly. “Please tell me you’re not going to do something foolish.”
“Moony.” The voice, full of mock-hurt and devilish humour, continued. “Why would you ever think I would do something like that?”
“Well, there was the incident with the Fire Crabs in our fourth year, and then the time you got your hands on Muggle duct tape.”
The shrug lifted Harry a little, but he just hung on tighter. “Isolated incidents,” his godfather maintained.
Remus lifted a brow; Harry couldn’t help his grin. “And I seem to remember one of Filch’s cats as a massive, peanut-buttered glob—”

“Excuse me!” Daniel exclaimed catching their attention. “Hysterical anthropologist with a gun here! What is going on?!”
“Daniel, this is all just a bad dream.”

‘Oh,’ replied Dick, his face locked into the careful frown of the heavily sedated. ‘I don’t think I’ve seen you cry before,’ he pronounced.
~
“His man-boy. His helpmeet. His consort. The one who is graced with the privilege of fulfilling his needs. His lover, perhaps?”
“Uh, no, dude, I’m—we’re just roommates.”
“Oh.” He brightened. “Good, then that position’s still available.”

“I gotta tell you, at this point, the length of this conversation is totally disproportionate to my interest in it.”

“You know, to save my life I couldn’t name five teams that play in the MLS? I know there’s Luxembourg.”
“The MLS is an American soccer league.”
“Luxembourg doesn’t play in this league? So I don’t even know Luxembourg. Alright, nobody move. Name five teams that play in the MLS. And Casey says it’s an American soccer league, so you can’t choose Luxembourg. Go.”

“It’s a broken ankle, Danny. Why aren’t you concerned that I have a broken ankle?”
“Where does it hurt?”
“In my ankle, Danny.”
“Well, don’t move it around.”

“So, we’re all set then.”
~ It used to be better. When they wanted to talk from different rooms, they would send their maids back and forth between them. But then they caught on to how time-consuming it was to rely on messengers and so resorted to screeching instead.

“Hey Jeff, we’re going to this place where you wear a thing and something happens for $2 less than it would have before.

She shifted, moonlight hitting her at a different angle, and he saw the land itself swear fealty to her.

“Ed!” exclaimed Peter, rounding on him, but he stopped abruptly when he caught sight of the alarmed and confused expression on his face. Peter faltered for a moment, then asked perplexedly, “Wait, did you mean yourself? Or me?”
~
“Nothing,” said Susan quickly, shooting her sister a look. “Lucy put too much sugar in her tea, that’s all. Eat your grapes.”
“I h’vn’t h’d ‘ny tea,” Lucy protested through the peaches, to which Edmund added helpfully, “And I don’t have any grapes.”

“I can’t tell you,” he said, sounding frustrated. “I don’t know myself. It’s not like I ever sat down and thought to myself ‘ooh, today would be a good day to work out what frequency my brain works at’!”

“Got you that.” He said, awkwardly. “Just thought you might like it. Y’know. To remind you.”
“Of the time I got shot in the leg and had to be taken several thousand years into the future to get it healed?” Alex asked wryly, holding the bag a little gingerly.

~ Don’t plagiarise your paper for this class. Trust me when I say we will catch you. Why am I so certain? Because we are scholars. We study groups that call themselves things like ‘People of the Book’. We prove our arguments by running back to documents whose ancientness you can’t imagine, picking through dozens of translations and codices and fragments. We care about things like word frequency statistics and whether a character is written on or above the line. Even the most secular, practice-oriented, modern among us has surely spent hours, days, months, years on one text. And if by chance we don’t care about the texts themselves, we care about the people who care about the texts—which, by some commutative property, means we eventually care about the texts. We write entire papers on single words. You do not want to mess with us.

~ “What am I talking about?” Barney repeats, staring at her in disbelief, which turns into relief. “I am talking about - I am talking about nothing in particular, because Lily didn’t tell you about that joking thing I said to her a few weeks ago that she really believed. For a little bit. Because then I told her it was a joke. And she knows that.”
~ “Yeah, you’re a regular Jason Bourne, Barney.” “Since I love that movie, I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear any sarcasm in that comment.”

~ The Doctor’s attempts at hugs and friendly greetings are brushed aside as Sarah Jane assures him it’s lovely to see you too, Doctor, but hurry up, it starts in five minutes. He’s dragged upstairs without being told what “it” is, and the next thing he knows Jack’s friend - Ianto, is it? - has materialised out of nowhere to stick a carnation in the Doctor’s buttonhole.
~
“For heaven’s sake, Doctor, no-one’s asking to marry you,” Sarah Jane scolds him. The Doctor’s a bit put-out by this, and he’s half-debating whether to turn on his heel and make a run for it, but Sarah Jane and Jack are too quick for him. Grabbing an arm apiece they take hold of the Doctor and proceed to frog-march him down the corridor, while Ianto follows behind, quietly bemoaning the lack of time to pop out and buy the Doctor some more appropriate shoes. Really.

“Marriage is a wonderful institution,” says Rhys with alcoholic philosophy, “but who wants to live in an institution?”
“How about you, you daft great lummox,” says Gwen.
“Fair play,” agrees Rhys. “But you know I’m mad with love.”
~
“I think I might get married,” says the Doctor. 
“Did you have anyone particular in mind?” Jack looks as though he’d like to add a few pertinent questions about the Doctor’s thoughts on open, polyamorous unions, but a significant look from Ianto is all it takes to pull him into line.
“Well, not yet, no, but be fair. I’ve only just decided about the marriage part. I’ll need a bit longer to decide about the rest.”
~ “You’re all,” Jack sketched a loose outline in the air. “Illegal. I don’t know what I did to deserve this.” “You were either very good,” said the Doctor, finding the mug and twirling it idly by the handle, “or very, very bad.” He set the mug on the grates and lifted himself rather awkwardly out of the gap. “Knowing you—” “Bad,” Jack agreed, without really listening. “So bad.”
“I’m not any more flexible in this body than I was in the last one,” the Doctor said. A beat passed. His ears turned a magnificent red, and he backed away several inches. “I mean, socially. Concerning attitudes about— parts. My parts. Historiographically. You know what I mean.” “Your loss,” shrugged Jack. “Lunch?”
“Oh yes, please.” The Doctor grinned. “I’ve got such an appetite.” His eyes widened. “For pizza.”
“I hate you,” said Jack.
~ “It’s obvious, isn’t it? You need to figure it out without my help. I’ve already figured it out, back when I was you, so I can’t figure it out again — that’d be circular logic. The process has to happen, it needs to be figured, and you need to do the figuring, because I already know.”
~ “Oh,” is all he says, though he manages to make it sound more like Donna, you’re completely mad.
~ “Are you talking to yourself?” Dominique asked, carrying the box of wedding items from the crawl space with her.
“I’m thinking out loud.”
“So, you’re talking to yourself?”
~ “Actually, you would know. How many Jobberknoll feathers would you add to a super infused Memory Potion?”
“It depends on the strength of the potion.”
She smirked. “Which is why I said super infused.”
~ Jessica from the geek club in the basement says that he’s no Gibbs and Ziva lays her out with just one blow. “Oh, sorry,” the ninja says, standing over the cowering girl as she tries to plug her bleeding nose. “My hand gets spasms sometimes. I can’t control it. It is probably a result of the years I spent as a trained assassin.”
McGee stretches out a hand and helps Jessica to her feet. “Or it could be from that time that you killed a man using only your pinky.” He leans in. “As a matter of interest, how any ways can you kill someone using just…I don’t know…this?” Probie pulls a paperclip off of the folder in his hand and hands it to Ziva; she looks at it speculatively. 
“Eighteen,” she decides after a moment of silence, “But I have a nineteenth that I’m interested in learning.”
~
“That’s the most ridiculous question I’ve ever heard. If I knew then what I know now, then I wouldn’t have to do it again, because I’d already know!”
~ “I’m going to cut you off there, because I know Auntie Dru wouldn’t approve of the word that was about to come out of your mouth.”
She laughed. “She also wouldn’t approve of the name ‘Auntie Dru’.”
Sirius grinned, sitting up straighter in his chair. “I know. Isn’t it great? I’m going to try it out at Christmas, and see how many shades of purple I can make her face turn.”
“I’ll give you a Galleon if you make it up to six.”
~ The man looked worried. The doctor was never supposed to look worried. It was a cosmic rule or something. When the doctor looked worried, it was usually a signal to start with the panicking. Dean didn’t approve of panicking.
~
The only thing Dean hated more than witches were man witches. Sam pressed that ‘they’re called warlocks’ crap, but Dean thought the word sounded too cool for dudes doing the work of haggish broads.
~ “You don’t look much like a genocidal maniac,” she says.  He shrugs. “The bloodlust comes and goes.” ~
“Oh my god.” Her forehead meets the closed door with a soft thud. “Your hair is fine. It’s better than fine. It’s gorgeous. Heavenly. Choirs of angels celebrate it in three-part harmony while grown men weep. One day, it will end world hunger.” She jiggles the doorknob. “Now will you please get out of there so I can shower and go to work?”  The door opens, and a cloud of steam escapes. He pops his head out, and she can see that he still hasn’t shaved. “Not quite done yet, I’m afraid. You are, of course, welcome to join me at any time.”  “Are you naked?” “As the day I was born,” he says cheerfully. He thinks about this for a moment. “Well, I should say, as the day I grew fully-formed from a spare hand in a jar. If you want to be technical about it, which I generally do.”  
~ “It’s my own fault, I suppose. I should have been clearer. You see, when I said ‘I love you’, what I really meant was, ‘I think you’re a babe and would very much like to shag you on a regular basis for the rest of my life.’” She grins. “Well, you can see how I might have been confused.”  “Oh, absolutely.” The hand at her waist moves to her arm, and he laces his fingers through hers. “Thought it would be best to tell you flat out. You’ve failed to pick up on my more subtle advances.”   “Like that time you set all your clothes on fire and had to spend the rest of the day walking around the flat stark naked?”
~ “Oh, neither did I.” He pauses. “No, sorry, that’s a lie. I wanted very badly to rush into things. All sorts of things. Some of them require stretching first.”
~ His brother, who had never yet reached a level of drunkenness at which he could not keep an eye on Sam, pointed his index finger at the ceiling.  One, his expression said.  You drink more than one, and I’ll kick your ass. Three could maybe be equivalent to one, Sam thought a while later. Three could definitely equal one. It wasn’t like Dean was objecting.  Dean was…huh.  Somewhere.  Somewhere not visible from the bed in the girls’ room where Sam lay sprawled.
~ “I shall inform—” begins Arthur, in attempt to recapture their conversational thread, but this time interrupts himself. “Are you cutting it off?”
“Some great prat seems to have mashed the buckle, so yes I am,” his servant informs him, and he does seem to be sawing at the leather strap with a knife. Then he looks up, and flashes a smile past Coveros, at Vedica. “That was you with the stasis spell, right? That was tremendously clever; I wish I could figure out how you did it.”
Vedica stutters, after a moment, “It’s— it’s a slowing of certain, um, biological— for difficult pregnancies, you see, sometimes, to stop her from bearing early, it’s—” and he’s heard her explain this dozens of times already, so he knows she’s just clamped her mouth shut on “very useful in lambing time.”
“Brilliant!” the deadly sorcerer enthuses. “I wonder if you might be willing to—”
“Merlin!” interrupts the King. “I can handle it myself from here. Go interfere with someone else’s diplomatic process.”
“Don’t be an idiot,” disagrees Merlin. “You can’t even get your mail off without help since you broke that rib. Hold still.”
~
“Tristan? Oh, your messenger. I’m afraid he’s back at Caerloyw. He had some minor injury—”
“Broken ankle,” interjects Merlin, muttering,
“Yes, thank you shut up, broken ankle, so he’s resting it until he can ride.”
~ “You’re bleeding again,” he says, in a reproving tone, at some blood that Coveros can’t see.
“Yes, I do it to aggravate you,” says Arthur, in an annoyed tone he seems to reserve for servants, or sorcerers, or perhaps just Merlin.
~ “I think maybe it’s all about patterns,” she says. “My granddad says that God does not play dice with the universe.” He laughs, and wishes he hadn’t. “Your granddad is Einstein?”
~
“I need a prescription for sleeping pills. My neighbour’s dog’s been keeping me awake and seems to be unusually invulnerable to poisons.”
~ Tim looks down, as if he only just noticed he’s wearing fetish gear. “It’s Dyneema. It’s stronger than—” “Shinier—” Kon knows, he really knows, that he should shut the fuck up. ~
“He’s a big guy – I figured he’d take the hit but stop. Didn’t factor in how drunk he was, which is probably why I knocked him out. Didn’t count on him being made of brick, though… think I’ve cracked some bone in here,” he added, holding up his right hand to show off the still blossoming bruise.
Gibbs looked at it for a moment, acknowledging the injury with a smile. “Maybe not brick… just marine.”
“Human freaking tanks,” DiNozzo said bluntly, with a look that said it all meant the same thing.
~ “Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS,” the man greeted blandly, pulling out his ID and flipping it to show his badge and identification.
Tony blinked again. “I have three questions,” he said finally, keeping his gun up.
“Naval Criminal Investigative Service.”
“That wasn’t one of them.”
~ “Hi, Special Agent Gibbs sent me down here to…” He stopped, suddenly remembering he didn’t really have a reason to be down here. “I don’t actually know what. I figure I must be pissing him off somehow.”
~ “So I’ve been thinking about it,” he says. “The establishment’s clearly not set up to handle this situation. Nobody even brought me a casserole. Aren’t people supposed to feed me while I’m coping with my bereavement?”
“You weren’t bereaved, you know,” she responds, the roll of her eyes clear in her voice. “I wasn’t dead. I was just temporarily misplaced.”
“At least I’m not the only one who sucks at this military spouse gig.” That, he thinks, sounds a bit more normal.
She laughs in response. “Jack, I’ve got some news that may come as a shock to you. We’re not married.”
“Yeah, I’m thinking we should fix that.” In the pause that follows his unplanned but not-exactly-flippant remark, Jack has what feels like a very long time to consider the effect of the coffee he’s been drinking all night on the filter between his brain and his mouth. While he waits, he counts the beeps issuing through the phone against his ear. He gets to eight before the sound’s abruptly cut off, and if it weren’t for the continuing hum of the other equipment in her lab, he’d think she’d hung up on him.
The silence stretches for several more seconds before she speaks again. “Really?”
Jack clears his throat. “Well, if that’s why I’m not getting casseroles—”
~ Now, historically, certain people - let’s call them ‘women’ - have harangued me for being a cloth-headed dullard when it comes to getting presents for her. The accusation hurled into my startled eyes is that I’d easily be able to surmise what she’d like to receive, if only I were sensitive, and empathetic, and could create life in my womb rather than endlessly starting wars. OK, then, armchair critics - if you’re so emotionally intelligent let’s see you intuit this. I actually asked (‘Ask’. verb. Meaning to insist, repeatedly, against determined resistance, as though it was a burdensome demand I was making of her rather than an attempt to fulfil her wishes) Margaret to write down what she wants me to get for her.
~ Surely complete tranquillity is terminal? All things, if they’re alive and vital, roil and retain inner tensions and probably have bits where they shout at each other in a bathroom for forty-five minutes solid. Still water is stagnant water: Margaret and I, therefore, are merely ‘extremely well aerated.’ Fizzy, even.
~ Margaret has a pension. What’s more, she’ll probably end up drawing it for years because it’s quite likely that even death is scared of her.
~
So, when I get killed by lingual mucormycosis or several leopards, then Margaret will get a lump sum just about sufficient to buy a medium-sized car and a selection pack of cheeses. Anyway, that’s the context in which Margaret and I were sitting around one evening recently imagining each other’s sudden death. (We do have Pictionary, but it’s nowhere near as much fun and you’re forever losing the pencils.)  “There’s no way around it, Mil. They refuse to recognise anyone except spouses as partners. So, if you suddenly, um...” “Choke to death on a vole?” “Choke to death on a vole, yes, or get your ear caught fatally in a wind turbine, then we lose out. And the same if I...” “Drunkenly pass out in a kiln.” “Yeah - that. You know...” Margaret flicks piqued fingers at her pension document, “You might have to marry me.”
A cheery tut clicks from my teeth. “No... but I might have to marry someone - someone with a better pension than you,” I quip. Really, you can’t imagine the searing scale of her response to my charmingly jocular throwaway comment; the Taliban would love her - she’s apparently got explosives strapped to the inside of her body. So, there’s a tiny batrachomyomachia during which I am, ironically, too busy ducking and weaving to tell her that she won’t get even the small one-off payment from my pension if she’s the thing that kills me. 
~ Simon blinked, looking confused. “I said walked, what? What are you on about?”
Ted smiled and shook his head. “I need to be as drunk as you are right now.”
~ “You know, you’re too lilleral when you’re drunk,” he slurred happily. 
“What the hell does lilleral mean?”
~ Luna nodded gravely. “The Quibbler did a feature on you last month. Is it true that you used to sing in Beijing opera until you were nine?”
“I – what?” Harry choked on his next breath and stared at the girl.
~ “Because we’re secretly investigating—” Neville began.
“That’s a secret, too, Nev!” Harry reminded him hurriedly.
~ “Fame isn’t everything, Mr. Potter,” Padma said and then added dramatically, after a moment’s thought: “You cannot buy my affections!”
“That’s right I can’t,” Harry agreed. “The amount of sweets and jewellery you require could clear the debt off of a small Third World country.”
~ That cranial damage made Sam cranky was quite true. He bounced off the windshield and upon recovering from being quite literally star struck, he turned to Dean and yelled. “Damn it, Dean! What the fudge?!?!” Only he didn’t say “fudge.” “Your car broke my freakin’ head!” Sam pointed to the cut over his eyebrow which was oozing blood. He did not actually say “freakin’” either.
~ “I don’t know if it’s registered. It was my Uncle Bobby’s gun.” Now to the authorities, Sam’s use of the word “was” was quite significant. They immediately jumped to the conclusion that the weapon had been left to the family by the unfortunate Uncle Bobby, obviously now deceased. Ironically this conclusion launched a somewhat amended version of Play #1 as they were moved to feel sorry for Sam and stopped asking him questions. In truth, Sam’s use of past-tense simply meant the gun had belonged to Uncle Bobby at some point in time, but did no longer due to the fact John had wrestled it away from him before Bobby could fill his ass full of buckshot. Since the next gun Bobby produced could have proved to be more lethal, John left the premises with much haste, taking the shotgun with him.
~ Max grunted. “Someone who used to answer to a number shouldn’t make fun of other’s names.”
~ “Sorry, Harris, I don’t fight people under five foot,” Will sneered.
Tom’s fists clenched, but he kept his voice level as he replied, “And I normally try to not to beat up people under a certain IQ, but I’m willing to make an exception.”

“Is Pogom the one where you build a Sucoat?”
“No, that’s Sucoat.”

“I’ve developed what I’m calling ‘roving’ office hours.”

“I’m not running a background check on your daughter’s date, Castle.”
“Oh come on. She says he’s quiet, keeps to himself and lives with his parents. Doesn’t that sound like a serial killer to you?”
“He’s fifteen. I’d be more worried that he’s a teenage boy.”
~
“So, this cleaner that I bought for my CDs managed to wipe all the memory off them, my laptop decided to stop working, my work computer erased all the songs off my iPod and now my X-box is broken. Seriously, WTF?”
“It’s a curse. Put your cell phone in the safe and don’t touch it for a week. Your alarm clock is in peril, and your camera is having bad thoughts. Act swiftly.”
~ Lily blinked at her Not-Quite-Granddaughter, who dropped out of the official Intrepid Hero Stance C (described in detail in the Auror Trainee Manual) and casually added, “Or, you know, we could go to the Order. Whatever floats your magic carpet.” The girl looked suddenly shifty, and quickly added, “Not that Mum got us all illegal magic carpets two years ago, or that I’d know anything about how to make them float. Because that’s a minor felony. And Dad certainly didn’t make us bribe him with good behaviour and proper grammar for a full two weeks so he wouldn’t take the carpets away. Not that we ever had magic carpets in the first place.” She tapered off a little helplessly, then rallied with a strong, “Yo.”
“I really could not care less about your criminally-insane family’s stockpile of contraband carpeting,” Lily sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose and closing her eyes.
“That hurts, Fake Grandma,” Little Lily said in tones of relief. “That really hurts.”
~
Parker had fallen asleep with other people around. They’d moved her while she slept, and she hadn’t noticed, hadn’t even stirred, and she freaked so hard she was fleeing through the lobby before she realised she was barefoot, and then she had to go back up to get her shoes. Alec gave her coffee as she walked gingerly back in, and there was an omelette waiting for her, and Eliot was hardly smirking at all, so she stayed for breakfast.
~ From what Scorpius could hear, it sounded like they were both discussing what barbarians boys were. That was an absolute lie; Scorpius knew that his manners were impeccable, and Asp’s were all right and would improve with a few reminders.

Clark looked up, to where Kala had just raced by, wailing like a fire siren and leaving Jason in her dust. The boy was carrying something, but it wasn’t a jellyfish and it wasn’t a shark, so Clark ignored him for the moment. 
~ “Not like they haven’t seen them before,” he opined as Lois sat up. “You breastfed. I have the video.”

“What are you…?” she began, just as he opened the box towards her.
As soon as he did it, he realized he was doing something wrong. “Oh, wait, I forgot. I’m supposed to—” He went down on one knee. With a nervous smile he held up the ring box, looked back up at her, and said the first thing that came into his head. “Hi.”
Her eyes had gone wide. “Are you serious?” she asked, though a small laugh of nervous disbelief had escaped her. She looked away for a second before looking back at him. “You’re serious?”
~ “I’ll be an angel,” Rick declared.
“Not the most reassuring promise when you’re riding a motorcycle.”
~ “Yeah, well, you know Mama. You see one boy, she sees sex and drugs and babies and the complete moral decline of America.” “It’s a shame you can’t get glasses to fix that.” “That’d be really cool. She could put them on, and suddenly chips would be tasty snacks instead of death in a bag, and rock music would be harmless entertainment for the masses instead of one of the machinations of the devil.”
~ “Mrs. Kim actually used the word funky?” “No. She said unsavoury and unchristian and various other un-things. I just summed them all up as funky. I thought you might prefer the short version.”
~ “I had a vision.” Dean sighs. “Was anyone being killed in it?” “No, but—” “Then tell me in the morning,” Dean interrupts, but Sam carries on talking.
~ “Better make it a glass of water,” she says. “Never know when Mom might show up. She’s got this sixth sense about me consuming anything that’s not organic and tasteless. It’s her super power.” “Some super powers are suckier than others,” Rory says sympathetically. “You can share my muffin — that way we can pretend it was just me eating it.”
~
Dean pulls out a machete and runs his fingers along the blade, as though he doesn’t already know it’s honed to perfect sharpness. “Ah, you beauty, you’ve been wanting some action,” he says to it, like Sam’s not standing right there listening to him talk to his knife.
~
“Dean, you’re holding a machete. You can’t walk into a diner with that in your hand.” “I’m not going up against a zombie unarmed,” Dean says belligerently.
~
“Gained at great cost to Dean’s dignity.”
“Will pop tarts and cocoa be sufficient repayment for the loss of dignity?” “Did I mention she pinched my butt? Repeatedly.”
“Marshmallows in the cocoa? You won’t get a better offer,” Rory points out. “And we even have chocolate pop tarts left.” “Dignity comes cheap these days,” Dean says sadly.
~
“I mean, what language is this even in?” he asks, pointing at the next book on the pile.  Rory peers at it and sighs. “No idea,” she says. She flicks through it. “It’s got pictures,” she says, a forlorn attempt at seeing the bright side.  They look at each other. “Rock, paper, scissors for it,” Dean suggests. “Loser gets it, winner gets a book in English.”
~
“Yes, it is. Very urgent. Life or death.” Sam’s going to cut off Dean’s balls, fry them, and feed them to the zombie if Dean doesn’t cooperate. Apparently his plan comes through in his look. 
“Oh, yes,” Dean suddenly agrees and picks up his duffel. “That urgent job. You should have said. We’d better get going.”
~ He likes to think that maybe Spock Prime would give him some arcane clue as to how he can make his own Spock stop treating him like a co-worker and more like, say, the best and truest friend in the universe. Unfortunately, he’s pretty sure that clue would be something along the lines of spending years bonding under the extreme conditions of combat— and that’s not the remedy he’s looking for here.
~
“Yeah, okay. Phasers ready,” Kirk says, resigned. Resigned to what, Spock has been unable to ascertain.
~ Still, he’s hardly going to tell anyone about it— and he’s not the kind of asshole to demand results his timeline has not produced of its own volition. He quietly makes sure that Uhura and Spock have similar duty schedules, hopes those two crazy kids can make it work. After all, if they stay together, then it’s almost certain that he won’t have to fight Spock to the death at pon farr o’clock, and that would be awesome. “The less fighting to the point of death, the better,” he says to himself, deciding it makes a nice motto. Not the most illuminating of mottoes, perhaps, but nice and serviceable. “You and Spock seem to be getting along better,” Bones says, suspicious. “Is he drugging you?”
~ “You’re impressed I know the word ‘yenta’, admit it.” “Slightly,” Spock admits.
~
“Seriously. Did you know the other me was obsessed with classic literature? Try picturing that before you worry about our mutual destiny.”
~ We had an earthquake this morning. Fortunately, I live in a windowless underground bunker, so I am fine. /However, my periscope isn’t working so I can’t tell whether the rest of Los Angeles is still standing or not. /I’m glad you all think it’s so funny. I’m 120’ underground with nothing but my laptop and stacks of gold bullion waiting out aftershocks. /Right, yes. I’m down here with my computer and my gold and my pony. And I’m tweeting and cleaning my guns./The laptop is powered by the pony on a treadmill. I planned it all out very carefully. /Minions, the pony gave out. I consumed the haunches while still warm. Very little power left on my laptop. Very little oxygen. I’m so weak.. / I’m back out. I was turning the doorknob the wrong way. Now I see…I left the lens cap on the periscope. Man, I’m covered in pony blood. / Minions (Mignions in France), one of you must have ratted me out on the Pony sushi—2500 PETA protesters are holding vigil in my front yard.
~
The thing is, the book is immensely enjoyable. It’s like watching a really fascinating train wreck. I simply cannot tear myself away from reading it, and I’ve gotta tell you, I eagerly await the next issue as much as any of my favourite books. Perhaps this is all part of some brilliant DC marketing scheme. People are having so much fun laughing at how bad the book is they’re willing to keep buying it just to see how much worse the next issue will be.
~
Arthur holds up his hand. Merlin thinks it’s the signal for be quiet. Or it might be the one for take ten paces forward then drop to the ground. Arthur has signals for everything. The fact that Merlin’s never bothered to learn them doesn’t seem to perturb him.
~ “Someone,” and Tony manages to put all the contempt in the world into that word, “someone has stolen my secret chocolate stash.” “It clearly wasn’t a very good secret then,” McGee points out, as though he’s being helpful. “That isn’t the point. The point is that it was you. You’re the dirty, thieving McThief.”
~ “Of course, I’ve noticed!” Natalie retorted. She paused, screwing her nose up as she thought, then looked up. “What haven’t I noticed?”
~ “Is there any way I can—persuade—you to tell me?” Natalie smiled. Jeremy wasn’t sure if the smile was primarily sultry or if evil edged ahead, but either way, he was doomed.
~
“How bad is it?” Jack asked, taking the coffee to prep himself. “You made your The World Is Ending coffee blend.”
~
“Actually, I said that I had no idea what it was. You were the one that suggested fairies. Anyway, that’s less logical how?”
“Well first of all, the incidents weren’t nearly close enough to any wooded areas. And they were aimed at specific people who don’t exactly fit the usual guidelines for fey targets.”
Shawn chuckled. “Only you could actually provide a logical defence in fairies versus ghosts.”
“Not true. Sam could. And he’d probably get you charts and crap.”
~
“You want some help with that?” Dean asked, his grin downgraded to a half-smirk.
Shawn glared. “I don’t suppose there’s a mockery-free option?”
~
“I’m making you fly despite your fear, Dean. Buying you the alcohol so you survive it with your dignity intact is the least I can do.”
~
Spock didn’t dare speak first. He eyed Kirk warily, waiting for his reaction. He wondered if he would be upset that Spock had interfered. Instead he asked rather unexpectedly, “Do we even have security?” Perplexed, Spock could only nod. “Good, because I was bluffing,” said Kirk with a slow, stretched-out smile that seemed too tight for his face. .
~
Instead he held the man’s fist firmly in mid-air. “You realize that I’m trained in five kinds of combat, all of them lethal,” he said lowly.
~
The door shut behind them with a merry little jingle. She ignored the fact that it did that for everyone.
~ She gets this feeling like Pam’s secretly mocking her, and similarly that Jim’s secretly mocking her, and that Pam and Jim are communicating telepathically, mocking her together in their minds. This is what happens when you find out you were the last person to know that Jim and Pam have been meant for each other since birth, that each other’s first words had been the other’s name.
~
Jim’s not a believer in false modesty. He’s brilliant at fencing, easily as good as Sulu already, even though Sulu tries to insist it’s supposed to be about finesse, not brute force and luck. Whatever; Jim’s still won their last twelve matches.
~
“For heavens sake, Jim, you’re not a cadet any more. You can’t sword-fight every swaggering ensign who comes on board.” Which, of course, cements Jim’s determination to hold the match.
~ They have an audience of two; Sulu to adjudicate, and Bones who’s probably there to heckle.
~
Jim doesn’t pay attention to more than one in ten of their sentences. He tunes out whenever they mention things like interphase generators and gamma pulse generators and broadband sensor matrices. He had enough of those at the Academy in the compulsory engineering modules. He’ll notice if they start throwing things at each other, right?
~
He looks sadly out the viewscreen at their ship, and Jim must be losing it, because instead of either sending the ungrateful bastards back, or dumping them on the nearest planet, he says: “I’m sure we can help repair it.” Apparently that was the right thing to say, because Dean lifts up his head, a single tear trickling down his cheek, and for a moment Jim thinks he’s going to get kissed on the mouth by a complete stranger. Well, it wouldn’t be too unusual — he’s a handsome guy, he can’t help it if some people just can’t resist him.
~ She appears in a flash of light, crouching in a circle of fire. Chekhov grabs an extinguisher and puts out the lingering flames, and somehow manages to spray the girl with foam in his enthusiasm. It’s a shame, because not only is she stunning, she’s also naked. Very naked. Completely naked. On Jim’s bridge. And he’s got a ringside seat. Some days, being Captain rocks. Jim proudly notes that he finds words first. Not that everything is a competition between him and Spock. That would be childish. “Hi,” he says, and okay, as greetings to newly materialized naked women go, it’s hardly momentous. But still, naked girl.
~ “There’s a giant squid in my quarters?” His life’s a fucking space opera. And not even the erotic type that airs on New HBO. No, it’s the animated comic type where the captain goes splat against the wall every episode and the pointy-eared bastard quirks his pointy eyebrow and steps on the captain’s flattened remains.
~ Uhura looks far too happy — she’s not actually smiling, but there’s a glint in her eye that tells Jim she’s smiling inside.
~
It all starts on Monday. Dean wakes up with wings. All nicely curled (“It’s furled actually.” “Do I look like I care what the hell the proper word is?”) up against his back. Not even cool wings – black leather wouldn’t be so bad, but no, these are white, long white feathers, and if Sam even mouths the word angel Dean is going to fucking kill him. Tuesday morning, they’re gone. Which is good news, apart from the twin green antennae (“I have antennas. Sam, wake up, I’ve got antennas on my head.” “Antennae.” “What?” “Antennae is the plural for the zoological meaning of antenna, not antennas. Ow.”) on his head.
~ It is Radek who first realizes that something is wrong, much to Rodney’s dismay. Though in fairness Radek only stumbles across the matter – it isn’t like it was a genuine discovery, or anything. At least, that’s what Rodney keeps telling everyone.
~
“I don’t always blow things up, you know,” John replies. It’s true – he’d rather shoot than blow things up. Less collateral damage.
~ Dean practices a dozen and one different excuses on the drive back. Some are simple. Denial, that’s always good. Huh, I never saw it before, must have followed me and jumped in the car when I wasn’t looking. He’s got the innocent, mildly bemused tone down pat. He’d believe himself. Except Sam’s a distrusting bastard who always squints his eyes and stares into Dean’s whenever Dean tries to sound innocent. Pain in the ass he is with his bullshit meter that’s way too accurate for Dean’s liking.
~
“That’s very touching. Do you want to hug now, or after I get a date?” “After. A lot after. Like. Never, maybe.”
“You know, I think you’re just repressed. In your feeling places.”
~ She knows he caught her looking because she can practically feel the smug radiating off of him.
~ “We were just heading back to the Tard—” The woman bumps him with her hip forcibly and shoots him a warning look. He regards her critically for a moment before saying, “Aah—our um, vehicle. Vehicle?” he tries, looking at her again. She shrugs. “Vehicle! That’s where we were headed. Care to join us?”
~ Jack spares him a glance and a deadly serious look. “If you don’t shut up, I’m going to activate the ejector seat.” Owen stares at him. “Yeah, funny,” he says, but Jack’s expression remains stony. Owen twists round to face Tosh. “He’s joking, right? I mean... there isn’t... you didn’t...” Tosh gives him her sweetest smile. Owen sighs, slumps back in his seat. “I hate you all.”
~
“That must have been... fun.” He’s quite proud that he manages not to add a snide remark about the fact that the entire organisation is populated by slow, dim-witted jerks who have a hell of a lot of half-arsed ideas about protocol, red-tape and procedure. Bastards. Just one little mishap and he’s blacklisted for life. It’s not wasn’t though anyone who was actually alive got eaten.
~ “We can protect you,” Kingsley said.
“They can’t protect you,” Teddy promised.
~ General Grey blinked at that. First aliens, now this. Whatever ‘this’ was. “Sparking?”
He could see Mitchell’s throat bob as the man swallowed uncomfortably. “She’s – throwing off miniature bolts of lightning, sir. They’re down in the lab trying to get voltage and amperage measurements on it now, but she zapped one of the R&D guys real good. Accidentally.”
~ “I said I loved you,” his wife corrected him as she stepped forward and brushed a kiss across his cheek. “I never said anything about your music.”
~ “He didn’t know the people he’d been passing information to were Death Eaters, see,” George explained. “He was cleared by the Wizengamot on grounds of ignorance, general stupidity and being a Quidditch star, if the past newspapers are anything to go by.”
~ “Look, Harry… this is not the sort of magic you’re used to. Not the sort of swish-flick-whoosh, instant effect, established procedure stuff. It’s… deeper magic, soul magic, where things get murky and nobody can really predict anything. It’s… difficult to understand.”
“But you do,” Harry said.
“I’m dead,” James explained. “That helps.”
~ And here Moody gave a truly feral smile that Harry returned with satisfaction. It was good to know that not everyone on this blasted good side planned to defeat their enemies with the power of love.
~ “Uncle Captain Jack told me that you have a lovely singing voice, and that it’s sometimes hard to tell your voice and Mama’s apart when you sing a duet,” William explained innocently.
~
“Please tell me you need help.” Abby shakes her head and he leans over and wraps his hands around her forearms. “I’m a desperate man, Abby. Sweeping, polishing, standing to the side and offering witty comments: I’ll do anything.” He makes a face and reconsiders. “Well, as long as it’s not sitting quietly and collating paper records from the eighties.” That’s probably the suckiest busy-work Abby’s ever heard and she lifts her brows curiously. “Wow, what did you do to piss off Gibbs?” “Why do you think—” Abby just gives him a look and he winces and says, in a rush, “I ran into him and dumped two cups of coffee all over him. That man needs a bell around his neck.”
~ “I’m going to read to you, Sciuto,” Tony says, like it should be obvious. And maybe it should have been because this is Tony and this is...a very Tony-like idea. “I’ll have you know that my younger cousins considered me the story-telling champion of the DiNozzo clan.” Somehow she doubts that, but she puts on a serious face and nods. “Of course. Did the honour come with a trophy?” He narrows his eyes at her and she widens her own innocently. “No,” he says, sounding suspicious. “No trophy. Now shut up, close your eyes, and listen to the scintillating tale of…” He squints at the journal. “…Forensic applications of infrared chemical imaging: Multi-layered paint chips.”  Abby grins and leans her head against his shoulder. “Weave me a tale of action, adventure, and illicit love affairs.” “Part One: The Abstract.” “Oooh, I’ve already got goosebumps! Are you going to do voices?”
~ Abby peers over the side of the table and watches Tony climb to his feet with the shredded remains of his dignity stubbornly clung to. “Yeah, Boss! Is there a case?” His eyes widen hopefully. “Please tell me there’s a case.”
~ The pizza is topped with everything, and Abby stares at Tony’s slices for a moment before reaching out just as he reaches for hers. They re-divide their toppings, because Abby isn’t that big a fan of onions, and Tony has a huge thing for black olives, and they get into a hand-slapping tiff over the mushrooms before Gibbs threatens to take lunch away from both of them if they don’t settle it.
~ “No, we were working on the legal department’s database. I wouldn’t make lunch plans on an Autopsy Pizza Picnic Day.” Abby pats his cheek. “You can have my crust.” Tony steps up to them, cheeks bulging and a half inch of crust sticking out of his mouth. “No, he can’t,” he says around the food in his mouth.
~ “So, today Michael’s very sorry that he’s not going to make it in, but he’s pretty sure he’s having an allergic reaction to his new toothpaste. Apparently Jan wanted him to stop using the Spider-Man kind, so she bought him Rembrandt and it gave him bumps all over his tongue,” Pam tells Jim as she rinses out her coffee mug in the kitchen. “I tried really hard to get him to stop talking right after the words ‘allergic reaction’, but he was adamant about finishing the story.” Jim shakes his head and leans against the counter. “That’s the second time in two weeks that his excuse has been toothpaste-centric,” he says. “This is too weird.”
~ “I keep telling you,” Jim says, looking for other funny things that are on sale. “That’s exactly why I vacuum as little as possible. If I were to buy a vacuum I’d actually use, then you wouldn’t do it for me.”
~ Every time Michael goes on vacation or is gone for an extended amount of time, Dwight goes through his own kind of seven stages of grief, the first stage being “tyranny” and the ending stage being “silent, mopey tyranny”.
~
“Would you mind terribly if I kissed you?” Her incredulous splutter turned into a bit of a coughing fit before she was able to reply. “Sorry, what?”
“Would you mind if I kissed you?” he repeated, still watching the road.
“What, now?” was all she could say, feeling she’d got completely lost in this conversation. He turned around and looked at her as though she’d said something particularly stupid.
“London is empty, Torchwood is waiting, and we need to save the world,” he said. “Not now. Just, you know, some unspecified time in the future. Would you mind?” He glanced back over his shoulder, before tugging her hand. “Come on, time to go.”
“Shouldn’t you be thinking about, I don’t know, secondary plans and escape routes and things like that?”
“I have twenty eight different alternative routes neatly listed in my head,’ he said. ‘I’ve calculated the exact amount of energy in joules and time in seconds it would take to divert our course closer to the Thames and throw you in to get you to safety - taking into account your reaction times and the likelihood of you struggling. I’m also keeping track of your breathing rate and heart rate and basing the exact speed we’re running at off that. I think I can be forgiven for letting a small corner of my mind think about all the things I should have said and done a very long time ago.’
‘Don’t you dare throw me in the Thames,’ she said, her apparently over-tired brain finding that the easiest bit to process.
~ She turned to Jack. ‘So crisis is all over and world is saved now, right?’ ‘Right.’
‘Good.’ With that she reached up and pulled the Doctor down, by the tie, to snog him. For a couple of seconds he seemed a bit confused as to what was going on - his hands flailing around a little - but then he settled one on her waist and ran the other through her hair, rather happily and enthusiastically kissing her back. When she pulled back, he looked more than a little stunned and was, to her supreme amusement, breathing as heavily as she had been after her sprint. ‘Well- I- Um-’ he stuttered, before seeming to settle on a coherent thought train. ‘That was just plain rude,’ he said. ‘No warning at all!’ Rose giggled. ‘You might even be half convincing if you didn’t still have a huge smile on your face,’ she said. He fought to straighten it, before giving in and laughing with her, leaning down to pick her up and hug her again. ‘Well this is as good an unspecified time in the future as any,’ he said. ‘Are they always like this?’ Donna asked Jack. ‘Before there was no kissing,’ said Jack, winking at Rose. ‘Not that they admitted to anyway.’
~ Okay, if you know stuff about Broadway I’m sure it’s awesome to see all these people showing up on stage and singing because they’re uber-famous and talented and all that. But if, like me, you know as much about Broadway as you do about quantum mechanics...then you have no idea WTF is going on. Hell, I probably know more about quantum mechanics than about Broadway. But that’s beside the point. The point is: A is so confused.
~ Look, I’m very organized. It seems like one question should lead to the next, to the next, so that it’s an actual conversation and not this awkward series of disjointed questions. And at the end of all those questions, we should have a deeper understanding of the man. Is this expecting too much?
~ The only creative step forward I’ve made all day is figuring out how to portion out a huge package of chicken breasts for single meals and arrange it in my freezer without being pelted with foil-wrapped chicken every time I open the door.
~ A woman from California has sued the makers of Cap’n Crunch for apparently deceiving her about the nature of “crunchberries,” specifically that the cereal contained no real fruit in the form of actual crunchberries. Now, while the judge in this case was at least rational enough to dismiss the case outright, this is still an extremely humiliating venture for bipeds everywhere. Never mind that any idiot (yes, even many literal idiots) should be able to tell from looking at the box that these are not real fruit, the real problem is where this sort of thing is likely to lead. Do I have a reasonable hope of suing because Cinnamon Toast Crunch isn’t made from actual toast? If my good fortune is not raised by eating a bowl of Lucky Charms? How about if there are not actual rocks and stones in that box of Cocoa Pebbles? Let’s not even get started about Life.
~ He picked out the badfic quote “his warm lips was on hers like rain drops on roses” and had this to say “And in the morning, when he hasn’t shaved yet, it’ll be like whiskers on kittens. However, please note that warm woollen mittens are not to be used as a contraceptive device, and I’m really not sure I want to see his package tied up with string.”
~ I think Chekhov was CG. because it’s impossible to be that cute IRL.
~
Dear Grublings, Please stop making me vomit. I really don’t like it, and if you have any hopes of getting a car, computer, or pony from me, you are NOT assisting your cause. Knock it off. From now on, each time I throw up I’m taking a dollar out of your college fund. Then every time you make a student loan payment, you can remember that I spent a few miserable months puking because you just HAD to occupy my uterus. Honestly, grublings, I thought we had gotten past this. You’re big fetuses now, you need to start accepting some responsibility.
~ I would feel so much safer on TNG’s Enterprise than on the original. On the original, I’d constantly worry about some random whimsical decision Kirk makes might get me killed (in all canons for Kirk, this applies.) Picard, though—I *know* Picard would want to rescue me! And even if I was the red shirt who gets swallowed by the black lake oil, or the yellow security shirt who gets shot down in a surprise attack the moment we hit the planet’s surface, I would RIP. knowing that Picard would remember my first and last name, and write a glowing letter of my bravery to my parents, and probably arrange for a lovely wake in 10-Forward, and possibly write my kids recommendation letters for college.
~ You know, I never realized before that when Vulcans say they’re “emotionless,” what they mean is “constantly irritated.”
~ “You disagree with me?! Then I divest you of monetary value! People who do not share our views are not legal tender!”
~ “So let’s see if I have this right, Johnny Appleseed planted all the trees and Paul Bunyan ran around cutting them down? Is that the deal?”
~ Also, while I have seen very little of the city itself on the personal scale, I’d like to posit that only 90% of the people here are pudgy gentlemen wearing tan sportcoats, bolo ties, white ten gallon hats to cover massive baldness, and a constantly-lit cigar (yes, you wear them, shut up). This is a step down from the 110% estimate previously held.
~ If I were truly evil, I would have suggested she try a dog groomer. After all, a dog groomer would know how to handle a real bitch.
~ This Russian supersonic jet makes all other supersonic jets jealous. Now go read about all the crazy tech that’s being thrown into it, like the “Magneto-plasma-chemical engine”. It has a plasma generating friken laser just to scare the air in front the hell out of the way. COMING THROUGH, ATMOSPHERE! STAND ASIDE!! It goes so fast, it cracks water into H2 and O2 by the power of sheer awesome - AND THEN BURNS IT TO GO FASTER!!!
~
Wow. She fell out of the crazy tree and hit every single branch on the way down. And then someone picked her up by her ankles and whacked her against the trunk until it fell over. And then tied her to it and floated her down the crazy river to the crazy sawmill where she became crazy 2x4s that built the frame for the crazy house on crazy hill.
~ Oh and here’s a little life advice for you. Do not watch genocide-themed Star Trek TOS episodes before bed. Because you’ll have weird-ass dreams where you find out that everyone in your town is going to be ~exterminated~, so you leap into action and try to rally your neighbours into running. (Logical, amirite?) But they’re all like “Oh okay, let me just set my TiVo first” and “What should I pack? Do you think I’ll need these earrings?” Then Khan shows up with a shotgun (IDK), and says something to the effect of “Should I eliminate these people?” and Dream You will have a hard time coming up with reasons why he shouldn’t lay waste to all of them, thus exposing the evil despot tendencies within yourself that you were previously unaware of. JUST SAYING.
~ “I always have a plan,” Dean shot back. “I’m just not sure what it is yet.”
~
“You know usually I at least buy a girl a drink before… Ow! Jesus, you’re flexible!” The last was said in something like awe and Sam blushed as he started walking again.
~
Their masked assailant suddenly collapsed forward with a grunt; Katie stood on the other side of the collapsed warlock clutching a rusty piece of pipe. The surprised look on her face told Sam she hadn’t expected it to be that simple. 
~
As usual, she ignored most of what he said. “Thank you so much for coming. I hope you don’t mind, but I told Tim that you were my boyfriend—and that you were a cop—and that you were a back-belt in Karate.”
~
Oliver nodded for a long time. “Sometimes I wonder if this whole wizard thing is just an elaborate hallucination and I’m actually just sick with malaria in the Muggle world,” he said lightly.
~
Sam could pinpoint the exact moment Dean’s ‘this is bullshit’ emotional wall slammed down.
~
Harry’s brows wrinkled. “Thanksgiving? But that’s American! Brits don’t even celebrate it.”
Remus shrugged. “Sirius’s always been a rebel.”
~
“Actually researching the theoretical underpinnings of the transformation was unpopular.”
“Really Moony, if you hadn’t called it ‘theoretical underpants—” Sirius cut in. 
~
“But we did test it.” The guys exchanged looks as James went on hesitantly, “And it had to be on something living—”
“Mr. Norris.” Sirius, as always, got straight to the point.
Harry blinked. “Mister?”
“The original partner of Mrs. Norris,” Remus explained.
“Nasty, mangy little furball,” Sirius muttered.
~
As the car spun around to the side before sharply overturning, Spike tried to grab Vala in some half-arsed attempt to protect her- he had to be operating on mad instinct; how much could he really do to protect her when he didn’t even have a body any more?-, only for Vala to fall through him as the car spun over and over, finally coming to a rest on the side of the road- fortunately the right way up- as Spike, lacking anything to keep himself inside the car- found himself flying through the door to land on the ground, briefly finding himself flying through a couple of nearby trees- and God, wood looked weird from the inside- before he finally hit the ground (Which, fortunately, he did not fall through; he wasn’t sure how he’d have stopped falling if he didn’t have this whole ‘instinctively solid enough to walk’ thing going for him).
~
“Actually, he’s a ghost vampire who got sent to us in an amulet by some ex-member of a black ops operation who used to hunt and experiment on demons; it’s… well, it’s a really long story…”
~
“Besides, she’s the one who offered,” he said aloud, the justification continuing. “And who is Oliver Queen to say who I can or can’t talk to?” he finished, his voice rising slightly. Standing up, he tucked the phone into his jacket, nodding his head resolutely, before walking towards the door leading to the interior of the Planet. “But no kissing,” he said quietly, as if reminding himself. “Absolutely no kissing.”
~ On his day off, Don gets taken hostage. 
~
Regaining consciousness was starting to feel like the only thing Don had done all day. Repeatedly. It was his own hellish version of Groundhog Day.
~
“Set it down,” Alastor ordered, gesturing at Albus’ desk with his wand.
Severus widened his eye theatrically. “But what if it explodes on contact with wood? It’s such a common assassination technique. I have already checked—and read—it myself, you realize.” Alastor snorted and then subjected the bit of parchment to an absolutely ridiculous number of hex and curse detection spells. 
 ~
Minerva shook her head. “Don’t give me that look; you heard me perfectly well. And it’s not as though I haven’t done it before.”
Severus crossed his arms over his chest and glared. “As I recall, the last—and only—time you transfigured me into a snake, it was as part of a demonstration for your sixth years. At no point was I pitched down a hole into a basilisk den in the name of curiosity! Why can’t you just transfigure a desk or something of that nature?”
“And how, precisely does one explain to a desk that you need it to tell a secret chamber to open? I’d no more be able to communicate with that than I would an ordinary snake from a pet store. I don’t particularly want to involve Harry, but we need a Parselmouth—or at least a snake who knows what’s going on—to get down there.”
“Well, why don’t I transfigure you into a snake, and you can do the opening?”
She gave him a decidedly exasperated look. “Because I know perfectly well what marks you got in Transfiguration, and I have absolutely no desire to spend the next week in St. Mungo’s while they attempt to restore me to my proper form.”

The other guys go to bed earlier, complaining that Sheldon is working them too hard, but he cites something like, “My circadian rhythms have adjusted to the length of daylight here,” and scoffs at the blackout curtains on the windows of the bunk room.

“From what I’ve read, there shouldn’t be any reason it wouldn’t be vulnerable to fire. We just have to make sure it stays there long enough to burn. Last thing we want is a pissed-off, flaming, cursed puppet on our hands.”

He trembles despite the oppressive blanket of heat and when his fingers slip on the key pad he unleashes a string of Russian curses that would absolutely shame his mother.

When we look at a crow, we just see a blackish blue bird. They see something completely different. They see, black-black, black-green, black-blue, blue-black, green-black, shiny black, dull black, brilliant black and so on. We don’t even have words for all the colours and light they see

“Hello, Richard. You’re looking quite peevish today.”
“Don’t you ever knock?” Richard boomed out.
“I did knock.”
“Then maybe you should wait for a response.”
~
She glared at him. Polly hated it when he tried to do this. “Don’t you dare. There’s nothing I can do there. She is not a child, I won’t treat her as one, and I’ll smack you if you so much as try to do it yourself.”
“I’m the one with dementia, and she’s the one who’s delusional.”
“Love, what do you expect? She’s not yet thirty, she’s loved you since she was ten years old, she thinks everyone lives forever, that science can answer every ill, and that any obstacle is merely a personal inconvenience to be overcome with hard work, good planning, intuitive brilliance or some combination of the three.”
~
“I won’t make fun of you for it?” Sam counter-offered.
“Until you get drunk.”
“Or you dye my socks pink again.”
“Or Caleb asks you.”
“Yeah, pretty much.”
“Dude, you suck.”
~
Dean glowered heatlessly at him. “Dude, you didn’t see the eyes on those things. They were plotting to kill me.”
~
“You’ve, ah, got something there,” he said. Jon pantomimed the brushing off of a shoulder to Jack, delighted to see Jack’s double-take as he glanced down at the uniformed shoulder, seeing only the star pinned there, glinting ridiculously in the sun.
~
“Can’t we just run a sword through one of the new boys instead? Then we can meet the Dutchman somewhere warm!”
~ “I’m sorry. James has been just promoted in the Auror office and has gotten this silly idea that he is intimidating.”
“I am intimidating!” James argued back while Harry forced back a snort. James still seemed to pick it up. “You got something to say, short-stuff?”
~
“Like a ‘hello, I like you, is that ok?’ kiss, or an ‘eating your face here’ kiss?”
~
“I need that to work,” she complained, not bothering to move her eyes from the screen.
“I need my hearing to live,” Cal said. “And, as much as I enjoy the dulcet sounds of Tuna Cult, I think I’d rather have my eardrums intact than listen to the wailing vibrato of Dalton Hanks.”
“Tuner Cult,” Emily corrected.
“That’s what I said, Tuna Cult,” Cal said. He came over and flipped through the French textbook on her desk.
“Tuner Cult,” she corrected again. “How do you know the name of the lead singer, anyway?”
“I am black hole of pop culture phenomena,” Cal said. “I also watch TV. By the way, he’s lying when he says he doesn’t have a girlfriend. He may even be married.”
“There goes my plans to run off and have his love child,” Emily said, dryly.
Cal turned his attention to the computer screen, resting his chin on her head to peer at it with her. He made a disgusted noise in his throat at the sight of her search page. “Please tell me you are not Googling ‘lie detection’...”
“It’s for my project!” Emily said, defensively. She clicked onto a Wikipedia page. “I have to do a speech thing about my parents for French class. Mom was easy to do, but you’re harder.”
“And it didn’t occur to you to look through the epic amount of books on the subject that are currently collecting dust in my study?” Cal asked. Emily’s mouse hovered over the link for ‘Dr. Greg Jackson’ in the Wiki entry. “Don’t click on him, he’s a crackpot.”
Emily immediately clicked. “Your books are worse than textbooks,” she said. “I just need something simple to say what you do. Then I can translate it. What’s microexpression in French?”
“Hanged if I know,” Cal said. ~
“I want a hint,” she said, frowning. 
“Uh, it rhymes with ‘disgust’,” Cal said.
Emily elbowed him again. “That’s a terrible hint.” She clicked on the ‘disgust’ button. “Ha! You’re wrong!”
~
He leaned over her shoulder again to look as she clicked his name. “That picture is rubbish.”
“We should put up that one of you getting stoned with that Moroccan guy,” Emily said, giggling.
“That was getting stoned for the sake of science and thus, perfectly acceptable,” Cal said, bopping her with the notebook.
~
“You must be Pepper Potts. You are very tall. I like your shoes. You could probably kill someone with those heels. Come in.”
~
“Virginia,” she said, hurrying to catch up. “Virginia Potts.”
He stopped, suddenly and she nearly ran into him. “Are you sure? ‘Cause I thought Obi said ‘Pepper’. I like Pepper. Pepper is cute, it’s fun. It sounds like a 1930’s detective’s girlfriend. Pepper is the reason you got this interview.”
~
He ‘accidentally’ mentioned poisoning his defence professor at school. After that, when he was required to cook, he had to eat first to prove it was safe, meaning he was better fed this summer than ever before.
~ Dungbombs were Harry’s new best friend. Petunia knew he couldn’t do magic on purpose outside of school, but even Dudley caught on to the fact that bad things involving horrid smells seem to happen (to him especially) whenever anybody upset Harry.
~ “How noses usually break. It met a force stronger than the nasal bone,” the man shook his head.
~
“Er-” said Harry, suddenly smiling. “Well, I thought of, maybe, being a High Inquisitor. Do you happen to know what the qualifications are for that position?” A startled grunt sounded from the corner where Umbridge was sitting. Professor McGonagall sat quietly, apparently thinking over Harry’s statement. Her mouth twitched slightly as she fought to keep away a smile.
“I am afraid I am not familiar with the exact requirements,” she said, somehow keeping her voice exactly the same as it was before. “Perhaps we could ask Madam Umbridge?”
“So, Madam Umbridge,” asked Harry jauntily. “Can you tell me the official requirements of being a High Inquisitor?”
The toad-like woman was almost foaming at the mouth. “I can assure you that you will never have what it takes,” she hissed.
“That’s hardly official,” said Harry, frowning in mock worry. “Did you need anything in the way of grades? A specialist course or test to make sure you had what it took maybe? Is there a pamphlet about the department? Or maybe you could just tell me the NEWT level’s needed to be one of the Minister’s elite?” Umbridge opened her mouth to reply, but Professor McGonagall interrupted.
“I do not believe there are actually any NEWT level courses needed at all,” she said. “The position of High Inquisitor was created by appointment from the Minister himself, and I highly doubt he would need somebody capable of any serious level of spell casting for the job. It is, after all, purely an administrative function.” Umbridge was spluttering with indignation, but Harry just ignored her and continued talking to Professor McGonagall.
“So basically I can just do whatever courses I want, and so long as I suck up to the Minister and agree to be his toady, I’m in?”
“That would appear to be the case, however, I cannot in good conscciense recommend it as a career choice, since it is very likely the position will not exist in the near future.”
~ “Harry,” said Ginny. “If it’s just a text book, that’s okay, but if it starts doing anything unusual, like writing back to you, I got dibs on seeing how well it can survive getting stuck through the middle with a dirty great fang, all right?”
~ “Maybe making Portkeys would be easier?” he thought, just as Susan Bones spectacularly separated her leg from the rest of her body.
~ Okay, the SGC generally disapproved of military members of the expedition strangling civilians, but in this case, it was also a matter of Rodney likely being his only chance to get back to Atlantis. But honest to god, if Rodney didn’t shut up soon...somebody was going to kill him. “...the most ridiculous timing. Why did you drag me out on this mission to god only knows what stupid planet just when I was on the verge of solving that perennial power transfer problem? And now thanks to your incompetence, we’re in some kind of alternate universe and I’m probably going to meet myself and oh god, I look terrible with a goatee. What if—”
“Shut. Up.” Ronon’s growl was barely audible, but Rodney’s mouth closed with an audible click.
~ Rolling his eyes harder, John decided that now the universe (whichever universe it was) was laughing at him.
“I’m really very sorry about this,” the dwarf said, running the hand that wasn’t holding a small blastery-looking thing through close-cropped dark hair. “But I need your ship. It’s a matter of urgency, lives at stake, etc.”
~ “The question,” Teyla said, “is what we do with you now.”
“I seem to hear that a lot,” Vorkosigan said with a sigh.
“Me too,” John said. Vorkosigan grinned at him, and for a moment they were in complete accord.
“So, where did you say you were from?” Vorkosigan asked.
Out of the corner of his eye, John saw Rodney’s head finally lift from the laptop. “We didn’t say,” Rodney said, his voice sharp.
“I noticed that.” Vorkosigan seemed to have forgotten that *he* was the prisoner. “You’re *really* not from around here, are you?”
“Just because we have a cool lock on our ship?” John tried to keep his expression easygoing.
“Because you have a ship, computer, and uniform, all in a style I’ve never seen before.”
“And you’ve memorized every ship and uniform in the universe?” Rodney scoffed.
“Yes.” The clearing was momentarily silent as John and his team contemplated that flat statement. Finally Vorkosigan shrugged. “Also, you didn’t immediately try to shoot me or hold me for ransom after I gave you my name and title. That pretty much eliminates you as residents of most of the planets in this system.”
~ Vorkosigan said something that was probably an obscenity on his planet, if tone was anything to go by.
“Give us Vorkosigan. He is carrying classified weapons data stolen from our research laboratories. He is a criminal, a thief.”
John glanced over his shoulder at Vorkosigan, who didn’t look especially surprised.
~ “I assume you have a plan?” Vorkosigan said. “Since we have about two minutes before they blow us out of the sky?”
“That gives us at least an entire minute to come up with a plan,” Teyla said.
~ “Let me guess.” Sam smiled, imagining what The Advisor’s son might find most interesting. “He’s going to major in bikini clad girls?”
“With a double minor in lacrosse and food,” JT replied.
~ “The good news is it all seems to be superficial damage, bad news, there is no cure for terminal ugliness.”
~ “Come on, man.” Sam grabbed Caleb’s arm. “It’s really not any of our business. Let’s leave this to the guys with the genetic obligation.”
~ You know how washing your car magically causes it to rain? Well, I just realized that something similar is the explanation for all this wet weather we’ve been having lately: I get new sidewalks laid, so we have to walk on the grass for a few days while it dries: Lakes form in the yard. I sign up for a vegetable share, planning to bicycle to downtown DC to pick up my vegetables every Tuesday: Look for storms on Tuesday. The bad news is, it is nearly four months until our wedding. I strongly recommend that everyone invest in arks.
~ For days now, I’ve wanted something to go just wrong enough that I have a reason to say (loudly enough to be overheard by any and all witnesses) something very much like this: “Captain Jesus H wonderflonium-bouncing Sparrow with both utilities and heathens aplenty sinking my battleship to make shoes for orphans on a pogo stick by the power of Greyskull during a thundering typhoon in the conservatory with the lead pipe in accordance with the prophecy somewhere in the Persian Gulf.” Predictably, for a few days all has been well with my part of the world.
~ She doesn’t just take names; she gives you a new name because your name does not currently suit her.
~ Does that brain bleach come in a bigger bottle? I’ll need it, I’m about to go hunting for Sailor Moon goodfics. It’s like going fishing for tuna in a shark-infested sea, while wearing a suit made out of beef.
~ Why? Well, there’s the simple fact that people are idiots and new shows like Lie to Me will end up running for five seasons (OMG solving crimes with science? GTFO!) while potentially interesting new dramas like Kings will get axed without so much as a second look. ~ When the game starts, you can pick one of four warriors, each with a different colour (which means nothing) and a different magic power (which I imagine means a lot).  ~
Americans enjoyed the film slightly less than their European counterparts, and were quick to point out plot holes with the film’s twist, but in any case, High Tension is a welcome change for the slasher genre, which features an endless parade of the same movie reworked slightly different ways. Also, lesbians. Nice.
~ To the layman, The Blair Witch Project is “just a bunch of people running around the woods yelling,” but to those of us with half a brain, the movie is a master class in low budget film making, and should be treated as such.
~
Well, as it turns out the old woman is a gypsy, and if Snatch taught us anything, it’s don’t **** with the gypsies.
~ I’m not sure what’s going to piss me off the most about Twilight. Is it the X-Men like powers they’ve given vampires now, or maybe the vampire facial expressions that range from smugness to angst and back again?
~
Why he’s a douche: Who copes with tragedy by becoming a vampire? Oh your wife and daughter died so now you have nothing to live for? So become a vampire and live FOREVER and kill a bunch of people along the way. Why not? Also, he bit a little girl named Claudia, causing her to live forever in child form, and kill hot girls because she’s jealous of their boobs. That’s a douche move right there. Also, the hair isn’t helping.
~ So whereas a show like Ghost Whisperer may get three times the ratings of Dollhouse on Friday night, a lot of that is because of its much older audience who are fine with staying home on Friday nights watching a TV show with 20 full minutes of commercials in it. The rest of us? Well, we live in the 21st century.
~
“So why are you watching this again?”
“Because it’s a new non-reality based show that looks halfway interesting. I need more shows to watch now that all mine are ending.”
“And by “all” you mean Battlestar Galactica?”
“Well, yeah.”
“And didn’t you start watching Dollhouse to replace that anyways?”
~
Why we’re losing hope for good A.I.’s in video games: Her name is Sheva Alomar. The game is Resident Evil 5. And unless you’re playing on the “just let me win, damn it!” difficulty setting, she’s the A.I. partner who is about to make your life a living hell. Behold as she accidentally rides a conveyor belt right into a blast furnace. Watch as you carefully lay timed mines in front of the giant mutant bat monster, only to have Sheva follow behind you picking the fuckers up and putting them in her pocket.
~ Aerogel, also called “Frozen Smoke,” is very much like Ben Affleck’s appeal: practically non-existent, but still there somehow. It is 99 percent air, with the other percent being silicon dioxide or fudge or whatever, and looks like fucking magic.
~ The mice ended up dying after being submerged in it for a few hours, possibly due to the gut wrenching horror of drowning, but not dying, while trying to scream in their tiny mouse voices. Rather than manning up to the fact that breathing liquid destroyed the mice’s diaphragms, the scientists blamed the deaths on impurities in the liquid (most likely horrified mouse shit). Aside from slow, tortuous rodent murder, perfluorocarbons are used for ultrasounds, and even artificial blood.
~ The military (again) wants it for see-through armour, probably so that every time a soldier standing behind a clear wall gets shot at and flinches in life-flashing-before-the-eyes terror, his buddies are justified for punching him and calling “two for flinching.”
~ Everything from tiny supercomputers to even tinier, super-efficient batteries, to more efficient solar panels to paper-thin materials that can stop a bullet, to freaking space elevators. Sunglasses hinges that never break, toasters that get the toast right every time, TV remotes where the numbers don’t wear off the buttons, ceiling fans that don’t vibrate. Bags of chips that never get stuck in the vending machine. Carbon nanotubes will fucking solve it all.
~ Yeah. Imagine just sleeping peacefully when snakes start crawling through your bedroom window and you know the only option is to run outside into the jungle where there are even more snakes and they all govern themselves because this is an island of snake monsters and you are the intruder. And you struggle through the underbrush, alone, scared, knowing that you will never make it back to civilization to punch that fucking Realtor who sold you a house on goddamned Snake Island.
~ When the Bubonic plague tore through Europe, the island was reinstated to its former “glory;” a final vacation spot for anyone with the plague. When the plague got worse, they lowered Poveglia’s requirements from “plague sufferers” to “anybody with any sign of sickness at all.” They also changed their policy of “let the infected die peacefully” to “throw them in a large pit (atop already-dead bodies), and set them on fire,” which, was quite a leap. As if this wasn’t scary enough, in 1922, a mental hospital with a scary fucking bell tower was built on the island (an island, you have to believe still smelled like centuries of charred, plague-infected corpses). According to legend, this particular hospital featured a doctor who routinely experimented on his patients with such things as lobotomies (performed with a hammer and chisel), for what was most likely described as “shits” with a potential for “giggles.” As the legend goes, the doctor tortured his patients in the bell tower (we totally saw that shit coming), and ignored their cries that they heard and saw the ghosts of plague victims.  The doctor was then thrown off the tower by the ghosts of plague victims and, while in the dirt struggling to stay alive, was “strangled by a mist that arose from the ground.” We would actually be tempted to disbelieve that part if this were any other island. Though we guess a much more plausible explanation than “the doctor was murdered by plague ghosts” is “the doctor was murdered by all those lunatics he tortured.”
~ It’s not all bad though—the residents are at least getting paid to stay there. By whom you ask? Why, science of course! Residents get a very small amount of money on the basis that science wants to see what happens to them if they spend their lives wearing gas masks and breathing in trace amounts of sulphur.
~ Also, the island’s kind of shaped like an old woman’s head, and if King Kong taught us anything, it’s that islands that look like stuff are never a good thing.
~ As for the actual “island,” if you were to try to step on it, you would soon regret it. You would immediately fall through the layer of trash, and then, kind of like ice diving, it would almost instantly fill in the hole leaving you trapped, and drowning, under the surface. Assuming you didn’t get trapped under the surface, you would instead be left to stew in a trash and dead fish marinate whilst the sharks circle you.
Oh, right, also there are sharks. We should’ve opened with that before we told you to go stand on the garbage island.
~ “Yes,” Bob said, in a tone of extreme patience. “I am Bob. Bob wishes to know what happened, and then he will be quiet.”
~
“It was hiding in her badge. She picked up the badge and I felt it make a grab for her, so I grabbed her first.”
“Mm.” Bob looked back at Murphy’s body, limp and still and barely even breathing, her face dead white in a tangled mess of dark brown curls. “Grabbed her how, exactly?”
I made useless grabbing motions with my hands and struggled for words. For future reference, it is very, very hard to describe how you did something when you’re not even sure how you did it yourself. “Like… I don’t know. It was a panic moment. I don’t think I could do it again or on purpose.”
~
“Bob,” I said, leaning over the table, careful not to touch Murphy’s bare skin with mine. “It tried to eat Murphy. I don’t care if it’s on the freaking endangered species list, yes, I want to kill it.”
He sighed. “Philistine. Traditionally one removes any vestiges of the infected object—remember, these used to infect food items, so that could get quite messy—and then there’s a brief spell. Are you sure you don’t want to contain it?”
“No, Bob,” I said, as forbiddingly as possible. “Tell me the spell.”
He rattled off something long and bumpy in Latin. I wrote it down phonetically, since I learned my Latin from a correspondence course that I’ve since decided was a scam, and asked, “Is that it?”
~
“I’m fine,” I said, from my snow bank. “Thanks for asking.”
She grinned in my direction. “I figured there’d be a lot more screaming if you weren’t.”
~
I laughed, suddenly feeling a lot better. “The Beetle is hurt, Murph. It is weeping tears of oil because you don’t love it.”
“It’s weeping tears of oil because it’s a piece of shit,” she replied. “Now get off the phone, I’m busy.”
~
“Larceny and joyriding?” Harry suggested. His mischievous look mirrored her own.
~
“When you’re the ‘Boy-Who-Lived’ and the ‘Slayer-Of-Voldemort’ people tell you things. I think it’s because of the hyphens.”
~ Jeff looked knowing. “You can never have too many breasts,” he said, and suddenly, he sounded absolutely certain.
“Yes you can,” said Tonks, perfectly reasonably.
~
“Rule number one of wizardry, kid!” he said. “They never expect bazookas!”
~
“You said you might be nine. That’s still in the single digits.” Dean is defensive. He’s not given to sudden displays of affection. Kid’s got him all twisted up. “Who the hell doesn’t know their own birthday, anyway?”
“They didn’t tell us stuff like that.”
“Who didn’t?”
“I want toast.” 
Dean snorts. It’s pretty bad as far as verbal evasion goes, but it’s cute. So cute, in fact, that Dean is willing to let the question go. For now.
~
“I’m a genetically engineered killing machine,” Alec says again.
“You said that already,” Dean reminds him from the driver’s seat. “You’ve said that five times, in fact.”
~
“Why the fuck would we do that?” Dean asks, and Sam can tell his brother’s patience is wearing thin. “You’re a kid and they did horrible things to you. Why the fuck would we take you back to them?”
~
Ben pokes his insufferable twin in the shoulder. “What happens in the woodshed?” the boy asks curiously.
“Well, you know I’m not exactly sure, but it sounded like—”
“Pie,” Dean cuts him off. “The woodshed is where Bobby takes well-behaved little boys and gives them pie. You know who doesn’t get pie, Alec?”
“Why aren’t you asking Ben?”
“‘Cause I’m asking you. Now answer. Who doesn’t get pie?”
“You don’t. Because you weren’t well-behaved. Bobby said—”
“Bobby says that eavesdroppers will get to know firsthand what goes on in the woodshed if they don’t learn when to shut their little traps.”
~
“This one’s jus’ like you, Dean.”
“He’s m’clone.” Dean’s brimming with pride. And Alec’s beaming, for chrissakes. Sam kind of wants to vomit all over himself and die. “I’d hope he’s just like me.”
~
“We’re at Bobby’s,” Dean repeats. “It’s not morning until Bobby says its morning.”
~
“You don’t get to start stealing in this family until the ripe old age of fourteen. You’re nine. No ice cream.”
“There’s ice cream?” Ben looks hopeful. Alec looks truly devastated. Sam’s starting to feel pretty terrible about the whole ordeal.
~
Alec doesn’t take his eyes from his job. “Ben’s gotta pee.”
Dean turns to Ben. Ben looks up from his book with wide eyes and a shaking head. Dean turns back to Alec.
“Ben says this isn’t the case. Why are you picking the lock?”
There’s a click as the lock comes loose and Dean smirks at the mischievous half smile that lights up Alec’s face.
“Sam’s in the shower. If I flush the toilet, he’ll scream. The TV said so.”
~
“He’ll be down in a moment,” the boy called, settling himself at the workbench once more. “I’m supposed to be distracting you but I haven’t the faintest idea how to go about it, so I shall save us both the trouble.”
The man’s stance relaxed almost imperceptibly and he gave Michael a faintly surprised look. “That is without doubt the most intelligent remark I have ever heard from a resident of this floating death-trap.” 
Michael told him that was hardly saying anything, but thanks all the same.
~
‘Parallel universe?’
‘Perpendicular, actually. Perspective changes when you get to see the Multiverse from above.’
~
“Still can beat you any day,” Dean growled back automatically. 
“I don’t like to beat up old people,” Sam scoffed back, and Dean just tossed him a withering look and left it at that
~ Lois pointed at him, “That was pretty much the face I made.”
“Is he crazy?”
~ It’s actually amazing I didn’t know he was in that movie until he showed up on screen. Good LJ-cutting, fandom. I’m very impressed.
~ He could play the new hero whose super power is punching Peter and erasing the annoying from Parkman.
~
“With a bunch of…things…out there that want to…my God, they want to eat us, don’t they?!”
“Yes,” Castiel agreed. “Although redcaps also soak their caps with the bloo—”
“Cas, shut up,” Sam ordered in a growl before turning back to the three of them. ~
“You’ve got my attention,” he said quietly, to the young superhero. “Look... um...”
“Dodge,” the youth supplied eagerly.
“Dodge.” He couldn’t believe he’d missed the obvious: the kid was wearing a Dodgers uniform, with the last two letters of the team name removed. ~ “There was a lawsuit we settled out of court a year ago, last June, for three-quarters of a billion. You’d probably have recouped most of that by now, but the way the economy’s going...” he placed a sympathetic hand on Bruce’s shoulder. “Sorry, Bruce. Forbes has spoken and you’re only the fifteenth richest man in the world this year.” He shook his head, still smiling. “Can you live with the disgrace?” ~
“You’re taking tonight off. Maybe longer. Hard to fight with broken wrist.”
Tim blinked. “What are you talking about? My wrist isn’t broke—”
Cass seized hold of his arm, none too gently. “So far. Keep arguing and things change.”
~ Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo—which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn’t a stupendous badass was dead.  ~ One day a couple of weeks later, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing. Lawrence decided that he was probably one of those people. Alan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologised for putting him out. […] Alan and Rudy’s relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence’s. Lawrence concluded that Alan’s penis scheme must have finally found a taker.  ~
“Rudy—take this stick, here—and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!” ~ “It’s me. But, Turing doesn’t have an umlaut in it.” “He’s going to have an umlaut in him later tonight,” Rudy said, looking at Alan in a way that, in retrospect, years later, Lawrence would understand to have been smouldering. ~ They were like three-year olds who shove pencils in their ears, discover that it hurts, and stop doing it.  ~ “Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people,” Ali says, “ which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons. And, the Philippines is one of those post-Spanish countries with no clear boundaries between business and personal relationships. I don’t think you can secure lodgings there without marrying into a family with a major street named after it.” ~ “For god’s sake, don’t say it so loud! I’m filling out the trademark application as we speak,” Ali said. Randy could hear a rattling sound in the background, computer keys impacting so rapidly it sounded like Ali was simply holding the keyboard between his pale, spindly hands and shaking it violently up and down.  ~ Andrew, who was the son of a lawyer, treated it as if it were a major corporate merger, and asked many tedious and niggling questions about the contract, which did not exist yet and which would probably cover a single piece of paper when it did.  ~ The software was never sold to anyone, and indeed could not have been; it was so legally encumbered by that point that it would have been like trying to sell someone a rusty Volkswagen that had been dismantled and its parts hidden in attack dog kennels all over the world.  ~ It was the only time in his life that he thought about suicide. He did not think about it very hard or very seriously, but he did think about it. ~ The rest of the day is spent  grappling with the fact that many two-dimensional structures on this and other ships, which were put into place to prevent various fluids from commingling (ex fuel and air) have holes in them and not only that but a lot of shit is on fire too and things are more than a little smoky. Certain objects that are supposed to (a) remain horizontal and (b) support heavy things have ceased to do either.  ~
“Yes, well, you know how it goes. One small word and suddenly you’ve insulted their whole galaxy. I admit it wasn’t in the best of taste, but they were going to drop you! From the cargo hold!”
“Yes, I was actually quite aware of that, thank you.”
~
Andromeda chuckled and then leaned in confidentially. “Earlier this week,” she whispered, “I ate a whole Sugar Quill.”
~
Of course, Druella Black’s Guide to Womanhood, step seven stated very clearly that one must never depend on looks alone, so Narcissa spent at least four hours a day socializing. It was terribly taxing, a fact which Eponine clearly had no appreciation for.

But before Eponine’s palm connected, a hand darted out and grabbed it out of the air, just an inch from Narcissa’s face. Both girls turned, and Narcissa broke into a smile that she quickly masked.
“Not a good idea,” Sirius said, his voice low. Eponine winced, ripping her hand out of his grip. Without another word, she spun on her heel and marched down the hall, her wand swinging her in her hand as she went.
Sirius quirked an eyebrow, a smirk stealing across his mouth as he snarked, “What did I tell you about speaking to people who aren’t bound by blood to love you? Because this is exactly what I’m talking about.”
~ “Learned it from Mama,” William answered brightly. “I’m not sure what a wastrel is...” his forehead wrinkled as he searched his memory for a definition, “but I’m pretty sure they drink too much rum,” he added proudly. “I know she’s called Uncle Captain Jack one a few times.”
~
Harry sighed and sat down, “What am I doing here, huh? You wouldn’t rather know my favourite pizza toppings? My drink of choice? Straight into the hard stuff, huh?”
~ The woman returned his smile and then cocked her head to the side, “Damn… What did they feed you, Miracle-Gro?”
Sam snickered, “Oh, you know… Lucky Charms, Spaghetti-O’s, and Happy Meals. The usual.”
“I knew my folks were full of shit when they told me that veggies were good for me!” 
~
Johnny sat at the remaining open chair and stared at Harry. “My dad used to play quodpot,” he blurted.
“What the fuck?” Dean said, exchanging a confused expression with Sam. Sam shrugged.
~
Sam wanted to scream, really he did. “And just how can you talk to snakes? Snakes are biologically deaf.”
Harry smirked at the tallest Winchester, “And that’s why parseltongue is a magical ability.”
~
“So, let me get this straight,” Dean said, leaning back on the kitchen chair. “Not only are unicorns real, but apparently I had a conversation with a god?”
~ Though his expression had fallen back to his normal, slightly irritated mask of measured indifference, internally Severus had to roll his eyes. ‘I hope this works. Every time that wanker comes back from the dead, he gets more and more pretentious.’ 
~
“You’re worried that your brother is happy?”
Dean groaned, “Don’t say it like that – you make me sound like a whackjob.”
~
“Were you always this funny, Potter, or is the sense of humour a recent acquisition?”
Harry glanced up from reattaching the wire, “Recent, of course. Bought it off of a guy who said it belonged to his grandmother who only ever used it on Sundays.”
~
P.S. Harry said to tell you hi, and wanted to know if you ever caught something called a crumble-horned snorecat or something like that.
~
“Two shots to ask if help’s needed. One back for ‘no’, two for ‘yes’, and three for ‘fuck yes and bring the first-aid kit’.”
~ Right, John, you did tell me to move my car, but if you would have told me there was a three hundred pound mirror you were dropping with a pissed-off demon, I would have moved it further, John!
~
“If I could do anything at all? Well, when I was a kid I used to play this video game for hours, Street Fighter 2. And I remember thinking “You know, people get paid to do this - to think of the game and create the characters.” Like there’s this one character Blanca; he’s like half human and half lizard and eats his opponents. Well you know he either zaps them with lightning or he... bites their faces off.” “So you’d design video games?” “Nah, I’d kind of like to be Blanca.”
~
“Why is it ALWAYS monkeys? Why can’t I ever be attacked by crazed super models?”
~
“Money is power, sex is power, therefore, getting money for sex is simply an exchange of power.”
~ “I mean, I spent three and half years training in some windowless NSA room. I got several degrees. I got a degree from MIT… And I bet they picked you up pumping iron in San Quentin?” “Have you ever been punched in the face for talking too much?”
~ “Yeah, I know he looks like he feels guilty. Maybe he’s Catholic. He’d feel guilty about everything.”
~
“Uh, hey, Dean, uh…. This is Ed Zeddmore calling on behalf of the Ghostfacers. Ah…we were just wondering if you weren’t too busy with, you know, your ghost hunting if you could come help us out. (pause; muttered shut up, Harry, I know) Not that we, you know, need any help. It’s not out of our league. It’s more, you know, in our league, just…more…under our league actually. So if you and Sam want to take it, cause we’ve got…a lot of investigations on our plate right now, you know, big, big list, we’d probably be willing to hand over the reins. And, ah…no hard feelings about the Ghostfacers pilot. We completely understand that jealousy is a harsh emotion. It can just take you over, so, really it wasn’t your fault. So, yea, if you could call us back, it’s 842-555-3598. No hurry, though. (pause, muttering of okay, all right) Okay, maybe there’s a little hurry. (pause) Bye.”
~
“Dude…funny story…You know how I said to take the car back to the motel and I’ll take a cab back cause you were being a buzzkill? Yeah, well, we went back to Cindy’s place…or…Mindy…or…I don’t know. Anyway, I’m outside her place now cause her fiancé just got back early from vacation. Yeah, yeah, laugh it off jackass. I know it’s like 1 AM but I need you to come pick me up. It’s ah…224 Lakeview Road. And ah, dude, do me a favour and bring me a shirt. And, ah, some pants. And some underwear. And call me when you get here cause I’m hiding in the bushes. ‘Kay. Bye.”
~
“I don’t try anything. I’m a perfect gentleman,” Sirius said indignantly but no one listened to him.
~
“I know that look, Harry. I’ve seen James wearing that same expression a thousand times. Are you up to something illegal?” Sirius asked, sounding strangely joyful.
“And that’s why you didn’t bring Hermione!” Fred added. “What is it? Something to do with Umbridge? Because I can tell you where I kept the fire crackers…”
~
“There might be a tiny chance I’m from an alternate universe,” he added. “But I’m pretty sure I’m from the past.” ~
“I woke up six years in the future,” Clark replied in his defence. “I’ve kind of had a surreal day.”
~ “Ollie, I can guarantee you it’s not what you think.”
“What do I think?” he asked, with a smirk. She narrowed her eyes thoughtfully at him.
“I’m not sure, but considering your expression, it can’t be anything reasonable.” she pointed.
~
“Just in case you’re wondering,” Lois leaned in closer to him as they were bundled towards the large truck, “This was never in the plan.”
“I guessed.”
~
“You can take away the guards and add a sweetheart like Alfred but a prison is a prison no matter how many expensive antiques you add to it. And if any of you think I’m going to sit here and whittle little bat shaped weapons out of wood while you spend weeks trying to crack security codes I can get through in a quarter of the time then –”
“You whittle weapons out of wood?” Oliver raised his brows in question at Bruce, “That’s retro of you.”
~
She aimed a weak smile his way, “You know how you said to stay out of trouble?”
He felt a distinct sense of foreboding, “Yes.”
“That didn’t go so well.”
~
Lois scowled at them all, “How about the part that says the man is dead? Can I leave that in? Is that okay? Or should I re-word it to say he’s permanently lacking in oxygen?”
~
“He didn’t do it! And I was worried about you! Murder trumps fake bank robbery every time!”
~
When he stepped into the hall he turned, his voice firm, “All the locks.”
“Yes, Mom.”
He backed away as she began to close the door, “And no answering the door to anyone.”
“Uh-huh, ‘cause he’s likely to send someone who knocks…”
~
“Yes, I know what you said, Eugene. Now be a good boy and give me the gun before you get in even more trouble. There’s a very small chance you might actually shoot me and just think how bad you’d feel about that,” She looked at it a little more closely, “Though taking the safety off might help.”
Eugene’s hand started to tremble as he handed Lois the gun, “I never would have...”
“I know you wouldn’t.” She checked the chamber and rolled her eyes when she found the gun devoid of bullets, “And for the record; you really suck at the whole fugitive thing.”
~
“Ah, yes, divorce..., from the Latin word meaning to rip out a man’s genitals through his wallet.”
~ He pursed his wide mouth into a thin line while he contemplated his answer, and then she got a reluctantly grumbled, “I stole a car once. Put it down to a case of rebellious teens,” His expression softened a little, “And try not to look impressed, could you?”
Lois stared at him without blinking, impressed regardless, “Wow – you think you know someone…Anything else I should know? Rob any banks at any stage?” Something that looked remotely like a grimace made her eyes widen to the size of saucers, “Oh-come-on-Smallville-”
His fingers tightened again, “Your turn.”
“Like hell, we’re not done with this,” She laughed huskily, her eyes shining, “Have we met?”
“I’m walking away now…”
“Okay, okay,” She took a second to shake her brain back into gear, though if he thought for a single second she was forgetting all this then he could think again. It was too good to be true. But when her thoughts turned to the matter at hand, she took a deep breath and checked around them before standing on tip-toes and leaning her head closer to his, “What I’m about to tell you cannot be repeated. Swear it.”
Light danced in his eyes, “Have I just joined a secret society of some kind? If there’s a ridiculous handshake I’m leaving.”
~
Sighing heavily, she realized her mistake, “I need that pencil back. I already threw one at Jimmy.”
~
“If anyone’s there,” She turned slowly and searched the room with wide eyes, “You should know I’ve got a...” A downward glance revealed the fact she was holding a spatula rather than a knife. Great, “I’ve got a ... weapon.”
~
One hostage facing the window saw a sideways “S” shield moving past them to the front of the train. He burped a small nervous laugh and another until they quickly built to out and out laughter, which brought him to the attention of the thugs, “What the hell is so damn funny?”
The laughing hostage tried to calm himself, “You...” Clark had arrived at the front of the train and turned upright, flying in a standing position at the door while the laughing hostage continued, “...are so...” Forcing his fingers between the doors, Clark tore them open to the sound of twisting metal, the laughing hostages words the only sound in the compartment, “...gonna get your ass...” Hovering two feet above the floor, Clark calmly stepped down inside as the laughing hostage finally choked out; “...majorly kicked.”
Everybody in the compartment was looking at the laughing hostage with no idea what he was talking about, until the stocky thug reappeared to shout, “There’s something-”
And a deep voice resonated, “Gentlemen...”
~
“Oh, sweet Jesus.” Kaufman poured another glass. “A regular fucking Warrior Angel. Don’t tell me he was wearing a cape.”
Jeanne sputtered for a moment. “Uh, sources say…”
Kaufman slammed down his cup and Jeanne stopped short. “He was wearing a goddamned cape?!”
~
One thing that had always amazed Wally about Superman was that he was impossible not to like. It was annoying sometimes, when Wally wanted to quip about how Big Blue was late to a League meeting, but before he could open his mouth, Superman would say something like, “I’m awfully sorry I’m late, guys, but I had save a little girl and a kitten from certain death.”
~ He looked suddenly worried. “Who changed what? Because the last time we travelled through time Wyatt nearly killed Shakespeare with a bit of banana skin.”
~ “She wore leather in the alternate timeline?” he said, excitedly as though he was being told there would be two Christmases that year.
“You shut up,” Wyatt warned, less light-heartedly.
Phoebe walked over to the boys. “Chris? You never, you know,” she glanced warily at Wyatt, “had feelings for Bianca?”
Chris and Wyatt looked completely shocked. “Bianca?” Chris said, his voice higher than normal. “Wyatt’s Bianca?”
“Yes,” Wyatt said tersely, “Wyatt’s Bianca.”
~ “He says has a can of water chestnuts and a box of tampons, and wants to know if we have a thing of orange juice and a ski mask we didn’t buy.”
~ “I’m not blue,” he said. Phoebe pulled off his glove and revealed his bright blue hand. “Oh, that kind of blue. Yes, I’m slightly blue.”
~ “He’s been in there a really long time,” Piper fussed as she and Paige and Phoebe waited in the living room.
“Should we ask him to puke faster?” Paige asked.
~ Chris took a gulp of juice, trying to avoid the question for as long as possible. Paige saw through his actions and shook her head. “I’ve got all day,” she informed him. “And you’ve only got so much juice.”
~ “A computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick boxing.”

“You’re not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.”

~ Avi’s business plans tended to go something like this: Mission: At [name of company] it is our conviction that [to do the stuff we want to do] and to increase shareholder value are not merely complimentary activities—they are inextricably linked. Purpose: To increase shareholder value by [doing stuff]. 
Extremely Serious Warning (printed on a separate page, in red letters on a yellow background): unless you are as smart as Johann Karl Friedrich Gauss, savvy as a half-blind Calcutta bootblack, tough as General William Tecumseh Sherman, rich as the Queen of England, emotionally resilient as a Red Sox fan, and as generally able t to take care of yourself as the average nuclear missile submarine commander, you should never have been allowed near this document. Please dispose of it as you would any piece of high-level radioactive waster and then arrange with a qualified surgeon to amputate your arms at the elbows and gouge your eyes from their sockets. This warning is necessary because once, a hundred years ago, a little old lady in Kentucky put a hundred dollars into a dry-goods company which went belly-up and only returned her ninety-nine dollars. Ever since then, the government has been on our asses. If you ignore this warning, read on at your peril—you are dead certain to lose everything you’ve got and live your final decades beating back waves of termites in a Mississippi Delta leper colony. Still reading? Great. Now that we’ve scared off the lightweights, let’s get down to business. 
Introduction: [This trend], which everyone knows about, and [that trend], which is so incredibly arcane that you probably didn’t know about it until just now, and [this other trend over here] which might seem, at first blush, to be completely unrelated, when all taken together, lead us to the (proprietary, secret, heavily patented, trademarked, and NDAed) insight that we would increase shareholder value by [doing stuff]. We will need $[a large number] and after [not too long] we will be able to realize an increase in value to $[an even larger number], unless [hell freezes over in midsummer].
Details: Phase 1: After taking vows of celibacy and abstinence and forgoing all of our material possessions for homespun robes, we (viz. appended resumes) will move into a modest complex of scavenged refrigerator boxes in the central Gobi Desert, where real estate is so cheap that we are actually being paid to occupy it, thereby enhancing shareholder value even before we have actually done anything. On a daily ration consisting of a handful of uncooked rice and a ladleful of water we will [begin to do stuff]. Phase 2, 3, 4,…n-1: We will [do more stuff, steadily enhancing shareholder value in the process] unless[ the earth is struck by an asteroid a thousand miles in diameter, in which case certain assumptions will have to be readjusted; refer to Spreadsheets 397-413]. Phase n: Before the ink on our Nobel Prize certificates is dry, we will confiscate the property of our competitors, including anyone foolish enough to have invested in their pathetic companies. We will sell all of these people into slaver. All proceeds will be redistributed among our shareholders, who will hardly notice, since Spreadsheet 265 demonstrate that, by this time, the company will be larger than the British Empire at its zenith.
Spreadsheets: [Pages and pages of numbers in tiny print, conveniently summarized by graphs that all seem to be exponential curves screaming heavenward, albeit with enough pseudo-random noise in them to lend plausibility].
Resumes: Just recall the opening reel of the Magnificent Seven and you won’t have to bother with this part; you should just crawl to us on hands and knees and beg us for the privilege of paying our salaries.

“I do not kick,” Ackles says indignantly, looking up from a book of carpet samples (their floor is still bare). “You take that back.”
“You do too kick.” Padalecki pats him on the knee. “I have the bruises to prove it. I’d show you,” he says to me, winking, “but I think the little woman would take offence.”
Ackles rolls his eyes and goes back to the carpet samples. “If you keep saying that I kick you in my sleep, I’m going to leave you and this whole interview business will be entirely moot.”
Padalecki beams. “See? And he’s smart, too.”
~ Logan squinted in the direction it came from. “Kid? Is that you?”
“I’m not a kid,” came the response.
~ Listening intently for the Wendigo, Logan felt around with his foot until it connected with a lump that had better be the kid. He moved to stand protectively over the fallen body while the damn thing kept coming’ at him. ~
Dean felt around blindly, his hands hitting bones and squishy stuff he’d rather not think about.
~ Sirius is making a list. The list is entitled “Why I deeply suspect I drank too much firewhisky last night, and quite possibly was hit by an Obliviating spell”, and it is a list of all the things in his life that made perfect sense sometime previous to James’s Stag (heh, double entendre, what) Party last night but no longer make any sense whatsoever. The first item on the list is: 1. I am making a list.

Remus bites his lip. “Hemingway. And yes.”
“I think the effort of being of being grammatically correct is starting to get to you.”
“I always knew books were bad for your health,” James agrees amiably.
“But I like reading,” Remus whines pointlessly. No one pays him any attention.

“Really, Moony. Who swims with their shirts on?”
Remus is vaguely annoyed that he doesn’t have an answer for this. Surely there’s a logical retort.

“No,” Dean snapped. “Well, actually, yeah, but that has nothin’ to do with this.”

Logan listened as the kid haggled with some reprobate on the phone over the price of two flame-throwers. He almost interrupted to say they only needed one, but he had always wanted to try out one of those things.

~
At a certain point, Sam just had to sit down and wait for Dean to find him. He didn’t like to do that. In fact, he pretty much hated it with everything he had. He was a man, damn it, he’d been to college and had a serious girlfriend, he knew how to use more guns and knives than the average Navy SEAL, he could speak three languages and read several more, he could find his way out of a trackless wilderness with nothing but a pocket knife and a piece of string (though a gum wrapper or two did help, Sam wasn’t going to lie), and he didn’t need his big brother to give him piggyback rides or feed him ice cream or, really, take care of him at all. Sam Winchester was a tough-as-shit adult hunter, and he didn’t need anyone. Except for sometimes. Like now. Because having your foot caught in a bear trap? Yeah, that kind of brought out every “FIXIT FIXIT FIXIT NOW DEAN PLEASE” instinct he had ever tried to beat into the ground with a hammer.
He was Sam Winchester, he was a man, he was a tough-as-shit hunter, and he wanted his brother to come and get this contraption off his foot before he burst into tears like the tiniest baby ever to get its finger caught in a door. And so Sam sat on a stump in the middle of a forest somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and manfully sniffed back his tears. Then he fished his cell phone out of his right breast pocket and hit speed dial 1.
~
Remembered his injured pride soothed by Dean calling the roller-skates names, saying they must have been invented by demons, assuring Sammy that he was awesome and he could totally beat those crazy things and how ‘bout if Dean held his hand for a little while? Just until he figured it out? Dean was sure it wouldn’t take long at all.

“I do not crash,” the car responded indignantly. “I was manipulated into sacrificing myself.”
“Between how many semis?”
“Semis would not have created this much damage. We were forced off a mountain road to give room for bus. They also buried us in a rock slide.”
~
“Because Rapunzel and Sleeping Beauty are boring. They don’t do anything. They just sit in their towers and wait to be rescued.” Lara lifted her chin. “Mommy says they were anti-feminist, prissy princesses.”
Clark was amused to hear Lois’s words coming out of the little girl’s mouth, but not surprised. “Yeah, but Mommy was also the one who got you hooked on the Die Hard movies, so her judgment on Disney films isn’t exactly reliable.” 
~
“Because I said so.”
“Really?” Lois stepped closer to him. “You just said that. To me?”
Clark fought the smile biting the edges of his lips. “I did. What are you going to do about it?”
“You’ve let this superhero business go to that little peanut brain, Smallville.”
“Well, me and my peanut brain are leaving. To you know, save lives.”
~
“Marital status?”
Lois nodded her head once: “Defiantly single.”
~
“In the space below, list your favourite leisure activities?”
Lois looked into space, “Umm.”
Richard re-phrased. “How do you relax?”
“Um.”
He frowned at her, “In your free time?”
She sighed and shrugged helplessly. “I sleep?”
They looked at each other. “We’ll move on.” ~
“Not a date. Not a date. Just drinks. Drinks and that’s it. Nothing else. I’m good company; I bet I’m better company than Lenny.”
“Larry.”
“Whatever.” Richard could see that she was thinking about it, so he pressed his advantage. “I hardly know anything about the Revolutionary War.”
She folded her arms. “I thought History was your major? I could swear Perry told me you graduated top of your class?”
He didn’t take his eyes off her. “In American History and Politics. From Duke. I don’t know if he mentioned that? Okay, I know a lot about the Revolutionary War but I promise not to even mention it. Not a whisper.”
~
“What?”
“He called me,” Lois repeated, blowing on the steam rising from her mug.
“No, I heard you,” Chloe explained, leaning even further over the table. “I guess what I meant to say was…” Her brow creased even deeper. “What?”
~
“I’ve been over and over it a thousand times in my head, and I keep coming up with the same answer.”
“Which is?”
Lois met her cousin’s alert gaze. “I have absolutely no idea.”
~
“Like a Bloody Mary, but of my own concoction.”
There was a moment’s polite consideration. “Root beer’s good.”
~ “Now I’ve got to go lie through my back teeth and tell Molly what an awful guy you are, all your irritating habits, what a lucky escape she’s just had.”
He smiled. “I’ll be over in a little while. I’ll get into earshot and burp really loudly or pick my nose or something.”
~
“Zach’s lost a power ranger and he wants to eliminate you from inquiries.” 
Lois glanced left and right. “Am I under suspicion?”
“We’re just making inquiries at this stage.”
Her forehead dimpled. “Why would I have his power ranger?”
“He thought you might’ve taken it home with you the last time you were here. He thought it could have slipped into your handbag. ...By accident.” 
Lois squinted. She placed her hand across her heart, and intoned, “Lucy, as God is my witness, and by the power of Greyskull, I can tell you I did not steal Zach’s power ranger. Accidentally or otherwise.” Thinking on it, she added, “I’m not sure I even spoke to Zach the last time I was there- he was watching cartoons with that kid from next door.”
Lucy sounded businesslike and brisk. “Yes. Okay, thanks Lo. Excuse me.” 
Away from the phone, Lois heard Lucy yell, “ZACH! SHE DOESN’T HAVE IT.” There was a pause. “NO, SHE’S SURE.” Then Lucy was on the line again, “Are you sure?”
Lois pressed her lips together in patience and assured her sister, “Yes.”
There was another gap in conversation. “YES!”
Lois heard Lucy tut sadly as she came back on the line, “It looks like we were right all along. Dale Stockwell’s got sticky fingers.”
“Dale Stockwell? Isn’t he the kid from next door?”
“And unfortunately, it looks like he might also be a liar and a thief.”
~
“Aw,” Lois reached for the ice cream again, “are you two doing something special tonight?”
“We’re fumigating.”
“Romantic!”
~ “Stuff happens to me every day. It’s just that ninety-nine percent of it isn’t potentially life-threatening.” Under his reproving glare, she was forced to amend, “Eighty percent.” His eyebrow raised. “...Sixty-five.” She blinked, “...Evens.”
~
“The good news is I was able to put the fire out before it got to either the village settlement or the harvest crop.”
Lois nodded wide, encouraging, circles, in broad agreement that that was indeed Good News; “...Good.”
Clark’s head bent to one side. “The bad news is, according to tradition, in the process,” in a breath, very fast, he explained, “I may have betrothed myself to the King’s eldest daughter.”
Lois shook her head lightly. “I’m sorry. What?”
“I betrothed myself to the King’s eldest daughter.”
She nodded once. Clark fluttered a hand in the air. “Something to do with rewarding, you know, a great act of goodwill.”
She nodded again. “Betrothed yourself.”
“Yes.”
“Okay.”
“It’s an ancient Ankozi tribal thing. Apparently.”
“I see.”
He thumbed backwards, “Remember that conversation about a second ago? About what a good husband I am?”
“Clark Kent: bigamist.” Lois clucked. Her eyebrows raised, her voice became wistful, “Now there’s three words I didn’t think I’d ever say.”
Clark’s face scrunched. “Well, I hardly-”
“Or should it be ‘polygamist’? Bigamy/polygamy?” She singsonged as her hand waggled in theatrical fashion;
Clark opened his mouth.
“I’m a little sketchy on the difference.”
“If you practice bigamy, then by definition-”
She turned to him, voice low and serious, “Hey, if it gets down to it and I have to husband-share, I call dibsies for weeknights, seasonal holidays, and special occasions, okay?”
He stared at her. “Dibsies.”
Giving it some thought, her mouth quirked and she bobbed her head. “Although I am prepared to negotiate on laundry duties.”
He rested his hands on the lip of the tub again. His thumbs lifted, “You don’t seem to be taking this very seriously.”
Her lips touched. “I’m eight and a half months pregnant and you’re announcing your shotgun engagement to a Tanzanian princess.” She frowned interestedly, “Do you really want to define the limits of my sense of humour threshold at this point?”
“Technically, I’m not sure it’s bigamy if the ...marriage arrangement takes place without the intended’s consent. Or, you know. Knowledge.”
“Ah, you’re saying you were entrapped.”
With patience, Clark continued, “As I respectfully but firmly explained to my prospective father-in-law, bride-to-be, and the rest of the extended family and assorted well-wishers, I’m saying that despite being extremely flattered, I would be seeking an immediate end to the engagement. And that in my line of work a simple ‘Thank you’ is really thanks enough.” He stared at her before amending, “Although, I did add that if they were fixed on some kind of formal token of appreciation, I know someone that could really go for a couple of bars of the dark chocolate they produce as part of their portfolio.”
“And how did that go?”
Clark nodded at the door. “There’s about a year’s supply out there. They also sent me back with some packets of the house blend we had with dessert.”
An amused smile tugged at her lips. “You stayed for dinner, then?”
“It seemed the polite thing to do.”
~ “Here’s the summary: I’m actually from the future, Oliver. This here is Lois Lane from your time. Don’t freak out or anything, I’m just here to fix something bad that happened. The future isn’t so great.”
He blinked at her, looking like he hardly understood a word she had said, and then looked back at young Lois. “You know this? You believe this?”
Young Lois nodded and took a swig of champagne. “Unfortunately, yes. Welcome to the Twilight Zone, Ollie. But watch out, the advice from the future sucks.”
~ “Apparently, excessive drink doesn’t only increase my desire to belt out Whitesnake tunes, but I happen to divulge quite personal aspects of my life to total strangers as well.”
That revelation sent a thrill through Clark. He couldn’t stop the quirk of his lips or the teasing in his eyes. An inquiring eyebrow rose. “Oh, so I’m a personal aspect now?”
~
Without a word, the man in the red and blue suit grabbed him, lifting him up in the air. He opened his mouth to scream, but nothing came out. “You and I are going for a ride,” Superman said.
By the time they reached the police station, he was babbling and pathetically grateful to be thrust into a cell. “Please,” he whimpered, as the door clanged shut. “Keep me in here.”
Shaking his head, the captain looked at the last son of Krypton. “Why do they all say that?”
Shrugging, Superman hid a smile. “Maybe they’re afraid of heights.” He nodded at the policeman, rising up in the air. “Captain.”
~
“Believe it or not, Clark, I have stuff to do in the daytime too.”
“It’s Wednesday and you’re drinking scotch in a bathrobe, Bruce.”
~
“Not today,” Terry says, and lets a Batarang fly at Ryerstad’s wrist. Might have been a bit more productive if he’d factored in total pandemonium.
~
Dick added dreamily, “Catwoman.” There were a few moments of awkward silence before he realized Bruce, Tim and Clark were all staring at him. He tried to cover himself. “I mean, yeah, Catwoman, have to stay away from her. She’s bad news.” He sat up in his chair, trying to ignore Clark’s amused look and Bruce’s annoyed glare.
~
“Of course,” Harry grinned good-naturedly. “I’ve been told that I have a ‘saving people thing.’ And Professor Lockhart’s assured me that the dramatic killing a Basilisk would be a riveting best-seller.”
~
“Well, actually, I meant ‘admit to avoiding you’, but let’s go with that. Why would I avoid you, Draco?” Harry asked, the epitome of innocence.
~
Harry cocked his head to the side, pretending to consult with said facial disfigurement. “My scar says that would be nice.”
~
“You four, hide,” Hagrid advised. Everyone looked at Harry.
“What makes you think I even have my Invisibility Cloak?” he asked.
~
And on Dagobah, Master Yoda interrupted his mid-early afternoon meditation to make a ‘humph’ noise. “Always melodramatic, that one was.”
~
“Smallville, we’re not in Kansas anymore,” she reminded him. “I know it’s hard to understand our sophisticated customs, but us city folk don’t start our days with some ‘nice morning exercise’ of driving fence posts into the ground and bailing hay. We drink coffee. We smoke cigarettes. We grumble.”
“Some people jog,” Clark pointed out, a hint of amusement tugging at his lips. “Actually, lots of people jog. If you go to the park in the morning—”
~
“Hey,” Harry said, annoyed. “You tried to feed a classmate to a werewolf because he annoyed you, you don’t have room to talk.”
Lupin apparently had no response to Harry’s comment and so continued with that he was saying. “He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James’s talent on the Quidditch field.”
~
“You find me captivating?” Harry took a step back from Draco, scanning the castle bailey and armed guards with scornful eyes. “And I find myself captive. Which is, I believe, the root of the differences between us.”
~
“You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.”
Han looked in Luke’s direction. “Doesn’t sound so bad,” he commented. But Luke knew better.
“In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years,” Threepio concluded.
“On second thought, let’s pass on that, huh?” Han decided.
~
“If you’re dreaming, so am I.” His dad’s tone was softly wry. “And I don’t think that theory will work when it’s both of us.”
His mother wheeled on him abruptly, dashing one hand against her head. “Well of course you’re going to say that. I’m dreaming, Remus, you saying that proves nothing! How do I know I didn’t just dream you saying you must be dreaming too?”
The look his dad directed at Teddy was so bizarrely, inappropriately humorous that for a moment it was his turn to wonder if he was hallucinating. “You must excuse your mother, Teddy,” he drawled dryly. “She has these occasional disagreements with reality.”
“Oi!” His mum marched up to his dad, glaring into his eyes from less than an inch distant. “Watch it, Lupin! Just because I’m dreaming this doesn’t mean it won’t hurt when I hit you. In fact, since it’s my dream, I’ll dream that it hurt you more than usual…”
And then, astonishingly, his father gave a half smile. “Now, Dora. Not in front of the baby.”
~ If he’s being quiet, he’s up to something. It’s not that he’s being good for once. Learn this. 
~
After she walked away, he was gathering his things from the trunk he had dropped, when a red-headed little girl about five came over to him and said, “Weave Wosie awone!” and she kicked him in the stomach.
“LUCY! Come here now!” shouted Percy Weasley to his daughter. Scorpius watched as her Uncle Ron handed her a lollipop roughly the size of her head behind her father’s back.
~
“Eat chocolate and mope,” she said.
“That’ll help, will it?”
“Yes,” she said. “Trust me, I’m an expert.”
~
“I think there’s a chance we’re going to the Quidditch together.”
“How much of a chance?”
“A very real chance.”
“Why?”
“Because I think I asked her if she wanted to go with me.”
~
“Did you ever do something so unbelievably stupid that you just wanted to gouge your own brain out with a spoon, just to get rid of the memory?” Remus said. “Or wish you could turn back time just so you could slap yourself really hard? Or did you ever have the feeling that all you want to do is hide somewhere really small so you never, ever, have to deal with another human being ever, ever again, because you’re obviously totally bloody useless at it?”
Peter stopped what he was doing and gazed at him, open-mouthed with incomprehension. “Er, no,” he said, eying him warily. “I don’t think so.”
“Why are you being all melodramatic again?” James said. “I thought we were over that?”
Remus shot Sirius a pleading glance and then pulled his pillow over his head and groaned into it. “You tell them,” he said.
“He snogged Susan Dixon in the library to make Olivia jealous and now he feels really bad about it because he’s a big girl.”
“I am not a big girl,” Remus muttered into the pillow.
“But you just kissed her?” James said. “It’s not like you agreed to go out with her or anything.”
Remus lifted the pillow far enough to raise an eyebrow at James. “I thought we talked about the benefits of the kiss and run?” James said.
“Oh he’s got the kissing and the running mastered,” Sirius said. “It’s just the bit in between where he managed to accidentally ask her out that we need to work on.”
“Accidentally?” James said. “How on earth did you manage to ask a girl out accidentally? Six months ago you couldn’t even ask a girl out on purpose.”
~
“Does your heart have to be in it?” Sirius said. “Can’t it just be about – you know, other organs?”
~
“Want a bet?” she said. She delved into her pocket and pulled out a bar of chocolate in distinctive Honeydukes wrapping. “This says that I can cheer you up in less than ten words,” she said, waving it vaguely at him.
He shut the book and tossed it onto the grass. “Go on, then.”
Lily held up her fingers. “Elsa,” she said, folding a finger down as she ticked off each word, “said you were a better kisser than Sirius.”
Remus screwed his eyes shut, not entirely sure why he suddenly felt so embarrassed. “Do I want to ask what she said?” he asked.
“Depends on how much redder you want to go.”
“What am I at now?” he said.
“Strawberry.”
“I can go to crimson,” he said. “Is that far enough?”
~
He made it to his bed and flopped down on his back, staring at the canopy and not really listening to the threats of retribution they were making. His stomach was swirling like a turning tide.
“I think I might have just lost my virginity,” he said, thinking that if he said it out loud, it might feel a bit more real. There was a moment of shocked silence. And then another one. And then the sound of three boys leaping off a bed, and six feet scrabbling across the floor.
“What?” Peter said, swimming into view, to be joined moments later by James’ face, wide-eyed with surprise, and Sirius’, grinning, as they all peered at him from above.
“Not to rain on your parade, Moony,” Sirius said, “but if you only think you have you probably haven’t.”
“I was being coy,” he said, rolling his eyes. “I have.”
“I knew you and Lucidia would hit it off. What was it like?” Sirius asked.
Remus fingered the lump that was forming on the back of his head where he’d hit it on a shelf and toyed with the words ‘awkward’, ‘terrifying’ and ‘painful’. “Does anyone know a healing spell for concussion?”
~
“I like her,” he said. “She doesn’t play those unfathomable girl games.” He wasn’t entirely sure he’d said ‘unfathomable’ correctly. The word felt lumpy in his mouth. “Maybe it’s just me,” Remus said, “but sometimes when I was talking to Olivia it was like we were talking, but that wasn’t all that was going on. It was like we were playing a game of emotional chess at the same time. Only she hadn’t told me what the rules were, so I always lost.”
~
“Don’t call her a tart,” Remus said. “She’s just…friendly.”
~
“Practicing? Oh really?” Remus said. “I must have dozed off when Professor Flitwick was explaining about having to perform them with your trousers round your ankles. Maybe you can discuss it during detention.”
“That’s a bit hypocritical, don’t you think?” she said. “This time yesterday we were doing exactly the same thing.”
“Firstly,” Remus said, “I actually know how to do a good enough imperturbable charm not to get caught, so if you wanted advice from anyone, I would’ve been a better bet. Secondly, that’s exactly my point!” Remus shouted. “Yesterday!”
~
“I think if you got to know him, you’d really like him,” he said. “You’ve got a lot in common.”
“Like what?”
“Well you both think I’ve behaved like a dickhead,” he said, “maybe you could start with that.”
“I don’t think you’ve behaved like a dickhead,” she said. “I think you’ve behaved like a boy.”
~
“Are you—” Lily paused, looking utterly confused for a moment. “Are you asking me out?”
“No,” Remus said, rolling his eyes at her. “Of course not. If I was asking you out I’d be red and stammering and barely able to string a sentence together. I was supposed to be going with Lucidia but I’ve just seen some fairly compelling evidence that that’s off. I thought maybe I could find out where James is going with Sirius and Peter, and then we’ll run into them accidentally on purpose. Maybe it’ll be less weird if it’s all of us and it’s not all set up formally.”
~
“How are you going to distract them?”
“Have you met Sirius and Peter?” Remus said. “I could probably do it with something shiny and a bit of string.”
~
“What have you been up to?” he said. He’d been asking him that a lot, recently. Remus supposed it was because recently his answers had been a little more interesting than ‘I was in the library’.
“Seeing something I really didn’t want to see and having my heart ripped out again. I might not even bother putting it back in this time. I might just wait until the next girl comes along and hand it to her so she can throw it on the floor and dance on it straight away.”
“What?” Sirius said, his eyebrows disappearing behind his hair in surprise. Clearly not the answer he’d been expecting.
Remus threw himself on his bed. “Lucidia, Arthur Wainwright, broom cupboard, don’t want to talk about it.”
“Can we call her a tart, now?” Sirius said.
~
“I assure you I’m more than qualified,” Remus said. He took another large swig of Firewhiskey, and then curled up in a ball on his side, clutching the bottle to his chest. “After all,” he muttered to himself, “all you really need to do is watch what I do, and then do the exact bleeding opposite.”
~
Lily ran a hand over the top of her skirt. “Are you sure I don’t look like I’ve made too much effort?”
“Yes,” Remus said, even though he had no idea whatsoever what making too much effort looked like. He frowned in confusion. She cocked her head and eyed him with suspicion.
“You don’t know what I’m talking about, do you?” she said.
“No.”
She slapped him on the arm with the back of her hand. “Then why did you agree with me?”
“Because I’m cold and I want to go inside,” he said, earning himself a playful glare. “Honestly, Lily, I’m not sure you can make too much effort, and if you did, we’re boys. We won’t notice.”
She seemed a little mollified – she’d stopped glaring, anyway, but the door remained a very long way away, and they were still on entirely the wrong side of it. “I just don’t want him to think I’ve got dressed up or anything,” she said.
“Why not?” Remus asked.
“Because I don’t want him to think I’ve done it for him.”
“But you have,” he said uncertainly, “haven’t you?”
“Yes, but I don’t want him to think that I have.”
“Oh. Right.” Remus wasn’t quite sure he understood, but arguing or asking for further clarification would only mean he didn’t get to go inside and his feet were going numb. 
~ “Besides,” Remus said, “isn’t it kind of the point that he knows you like him?” He couldn’t really see how they were going to make any progress otherwise. Lily let out a frustrated huff.
“No,” she said. “Not – you know – straight away.”
“Right,” Remus said, utterly baffled.
~
“If we’re The Beatles, then she’s Yoko, and no good will come of this.”
“We’re not The Beatles,” Remus said. No-one listened.
“Which one of us is Ringo?” Peter asked.
“You,” Sirius said without hesitation.
~
“With her being a prefect and everything….” Peter added.
Remus eyed them suspiciously. “I thought you said you weren’t plotting anything?”
“Since when do we tell the truth when you ask us that?” Sirius said, grinning. ~
“No!” James said quickly. He shot a glance at Sirius. “Sorry,” he said, looking rather pained, “but it’s Lily, volunteering to spend time in my company. Do you have any idea how rare that is?”
Sirius rolled his eyes and muttered something that sounded very much like ‘Yoko bloody Ono’ and ‘the beginning of the end’. James ignored him, fixing Remus instead with a rather anguished look. “I just – I mean what am I supposed to – look at my clothes. I look ridiculous.” Remus eyed James’ perfectly ordinary-looking navy jumper with confusion, wondering if sartorial anxiety was catching. ~
“A toast,” Sirius said, raising his tankard and grinning. “Here’s to Moony and his disastrous love-life.” Peter and James lifted their tankards obligingly, and they clinked and raised them to their lips. 
“Well,” Remus said, “I was wondering what to do with the rest of my afternoon, and it appears a solution has just presented itself. I’ll sit here and get glared at, and you can all make fun of me.”
“It’s your own fault,” Lily said. “This is what happens when you sleep with tarts.” James, Peter and Sirius spluttered into their Butterbeer. Sirius recovered first, while James looked utterly mortified and wiped the foam off his glasses as surreptitiously as he could on his sleeve, and Peter made a vague choking noise. 
“How come she gets to call her a tart and we don’t?” Sirius said indignantly as he patted Peter on the back and Peter’s face went puce.
“Firstly, because she’s a girl,” Remus said. “Secondly, and more importantly, I’m not about to argue with her because she hits harder than any of you, and as you should all know by now, when it comes to physical violence, I’m an abject coward.”
~
“What do you suggest we try? Lucidia Jones had—” Sirius stopped himself, cast Lily a furtive glance and furrowed his brow, evidently trying to think of a less crass way to say whatever it was that he had been about to, “ –done things to you any normal man would find very persuasive, and you still put her in detention.”
~
“Well at least tell me when you’re plotting this big mystery prank for,” she said.
“There’s a chance I might be busy on Halloween,” he said.
~
“I think she’s coming round to the idea,” Sirius said.
“Really?” Remus said, raising an eyebrow at him doubtfully.
“Definitely,” he said. “She was far more friendly than last time.”
“Last time she chased you out with a broom.”
“Exactly,” Sirius said. “This time there were no household implements involved in her rejection. She’s warming to me.”
~
“Well,” he said, studying his hands in his lap, “Sirius is the good looking one, and James is the genius – it’d just be nice if I was – I don’t know – the cool one, not the quiet one. Or the quiet one some people secretly think is the coolest.”
“And by ‘people’, you mean girls,” she said, rolling her eyes at him.
“Not necessarily,” he said, eyes wide with mock outrage. She raised an eyebrow at him. “Oh all right, yes,” he admitted.
~
“Good,” he said. “You know, you looked really pretty today, when you were talking to him and he was making you laugh.”
“Did I?”
“Hmm,” he murmured. He studied the fabric of the sofa cushion for a moment before looking up. “I just thought – well, I just thought you might like to know that, so the next time you talk to him you won’t have to worry about it.”
Lily smiled at him. “You’re definitely the sweetest Marauder,” she said.
“Oh well that’s manly,” he said, dismayed. She reached for the cushion he’d been absentmindedly toying with and swatted him playfully on the shoulder with it.
~
“Really, she’s—she’s—” Remus faltered. Whenever he tried to describe Heather, the only word that readily sprang to mind was ‘nuts’, and he was hardly going to make his case with that. “Well—” he said. He gave in and dropped his elbow onto the table, resting his head in his hand and peering at Lily through his fringe. He laughed at his own pitiful attempt at a protest. “All right,” he said, rolling his eyes and fiddling with the spine of the book he’d abandoned on the table. “She is worse.”
~
“She means that he bats with the other team’s Beaters,” hissed Harry out of the corner of his mouth.
“Since when has Dumbledore played Quid—oh.” He blanched visibly. “Bloody hell.”
~
Harry thought the conversation was getting needlessly tangential, and decided that the quickest way to remedy this was by speaking in capital letters. “BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH GRINDEWALD?”
~
“Come out with me tonight. You know, my uncle always says the best way to forget your troubles is to go out and find some new sort of trouble. You know, that’s probably why all of my cousins have done time.”
~
“I can explain!”
“You can? Really?”
“No, not at all.”
~
“I’ve never actually heard anybody use doppelganger in an actual sentence before,” Remus mused quietly.
 ~
“Then she said if I’d rather die, then I could die – and that’s when she threatened to throw us both off the Astronomy Tower so we could be together for all eternity in death if not life – so that’s your first lesson,” he said, illustrating with a point of his finger, “breaking up with Heather should only be attempted at ground-level.”
“I said that I was a useless waste of space, a loser who really wasn’t worth her time of day, let alone losing her life over, and she seemed to like that,” Sirius said, his face brightening for a moment, before the frown returned. “At least I thought she did. Then she set my hair on fire.”
“Oh.”
“So that’s your second lesson,” he said. “You might want to brush up on your aguamenti.”
~
‘Yes yes Olav. No need to greet me by my wand type all the time, a simple hello Albus would do.’
~
“I have been called a lot of things in my lifetime, but a figment of your imagination? I think not,” he paused to stare down at the boy once more, “but why would you think so?”
For a moment it seemed as the boy would not respond, then “I may have accepted that I’ve gone partially mad,” he croaked, “but I will not carry conversations with myself.”
~
“Fake my death?” Remus said incredulously. Even given the direness of the situation, he thought that was a bit drastic.
“Excellent suggestion!” Sirius said. “She can hardly make you be with her if you’re dead and buried.”
“We could claim you’d had some kind of accident—” James said eagerly.
“We could brew the Draught of Living Death—”
“And then we could do something quite gruesome with your body—”
“Because we’d have to be convincing—”
“I’m pretty certain I saw this temporary be-heading charm once,” James said. “French witches and wizards used it during the Revolution to avoid actual beheadings – although I think I’d want to practice on something first – you know, just in case.”
“I’m sure Wormtail would be only too happy to offer his neck for such a noble cause,” Sirius said, clapping a rather ashen-faced Peter on the back.
“Or maybe there’s a head re-attaching charm. I might ask Lily….”
“I really don’t think Lily would appreciate—” Remus started, even though no-one was listening.
“Can’t we just break his legs or something?” Peter said, fingering his throat rather nervously. “Or claim he got some kind of disease?”
“No,” Sirius said. “This is Heather. We need to do it right or she’ll see straight through it.”
“Although,” James said, tapping his chin with his index finger, “a disease isn’t a bad idea – I mean no offence, mate, but you’re so weak and kitteny-looking, I don’t think anyone would be surprised if it turned out you’d had something fatal.”
Remus felt mildly affronted, even though he knew it was true. “We’d read you something nice at the funeral,” Sirius said, rather too eagerly. “Any preference?”
“What?” Remus said. “Now I’ve got to plan my own funeral?”
“Well it needs to be convincing – I mean you’re very well liked, for some reason,” Sirius said. “Be a bit odd if we didn’t give our best mate, struck down in the prime of his life, a proper send off. We’ll keep it tasteful. Prongs and I always said we wanted dancing girls and maybe a rock band at ours, but I suppose you’d want us to play some of that dreary werewolf music instead. What’s that Joni Mitchell track you really like?”
“River.”
“That’s it. We’ll play that.”
“It’s not really very funeral-y,” Remus said, not really knowing why he was protesting.
~
“Are you going to say anything tonight that isn’t a one word answer?”
“Probably not.”
In spite of himself, Remus smiled, and Sirius grinned. “That’s better.”
~
“Look, mate,” Sirius said, “if you don’t want people to laugh at you for breaking up with girls by telling them you’d rather gargle troll snot than be with them, then you’d really better not break up with girls by telling them you’d rather gargle troll snot than be with them.”
“I’ll bear that in mind,” Remus said. Not that he really anticipated having to break up with a girl at any point in the immediate future…..
“I mean really, troll snot?” Sirius said incredulously. “How old are you?”
~
He wondered if she was an angel. A dark-haired angel, with Firewhiskey. She laughed. Apparently he’d said the last bit out loud.
~
“Right. So what’s your plan?”
“Extended moping,” he said, letting out a slow sigh, “until I get over it.”
“Well you’ve had plenty of practice,” she said, nodding mock-sagely.
“Yes,” he said, raising an eyebrow at her. “I’m practically a world expert on the finer points of moping.”
“You’ve got chocolate? And alcohol? And depressing music?”
“Yes,” he said. “I bought something new specially.”
~
“My tea’s gone cold,” Hermione said.
“What a shame you’re not a really powerful witch who can heat things with a spell that takes as little effort as blinking,” he said, rolling his eyes at her with playful mockery, and she laughed. He handed her his mug. “Why don’t you heat these up, and I’ll get us some biscuits.”
~
“He hit me for seducing his little sister under false pretences,” Remus said. “I never did find out if it was the seducing or the false pretences he objected to most. Too busy lying on the ground moaning in pain.”
~
“But of course you were too busy moping over Olivia and – what was his name?”
“David sodding Reynolds,” Remus supplied petulantly, wondering why, after all this time, he still just couldn’t call him David Reynolds.
~
The retort Lily’s eyes said she had planned died and she closed her mouth again, her forehead creasing in confusion. “Furry little problem?” she said, and Remus couldn’t help but snigger a little.
“That’s what James called it,” he said.
“Oh,” Lily said, eyes wide with sudden realisation. “That’s what that is. I thought you had some of that African sprouting mould in your room, or something, because that’s a bitch to get rid of.”
~
“I’m up here,” Remus shouted, “in bed with your wife.”
James started thundering up the stairs, and Remus stood up, brushing off his clothes and feeling lighter and happier than he’d felt in a very long time. “Tell him. He’ll be over the moon,” he said, and on impulse dropped a kiss onto the top of Lily’s head.
“He’ll faint,” she replied, peering up at him through her hair.
“Then I’ll get him a brandy,” Remus said, and he gave her a reassuring smile as he passed James in the doorway. “Morning.”
“Why do I need a brandy?” James said, his eyes switching rapidly between them. “You and him weren’t really—” Remus closed the door behind him, but could still just make out the sound of Lily hitting James round the head. He went downstairs and found Sirius rooting through his cupboards, looking for something to eat.
“Morning,” he said, and reached past Sirius for the brandy.
“Bit early to be drinking, isn’t it, Moony?”
“It’s for James.”
“Why does James need a brandy?” Sirius said, helping himself to a handful of cornflakes straight from the packet.
Right on cue, James shouted: “A baby? We’re having a—” There was a resounding thud, and Remus raised an eyebrow at Sirius and poured a brandy. 
Sirius gaped at him and dropped the cornflakes. “They’re—she’s—”
“Yes.”
“Oh bloody hell,” he said, grabbed the brandy, and downed it.
“Why are you—”
“It’s just so awful,” Sirius said, reaching for the bottle.
“I think a baby is normally considered the very opposite of awful, actually, Padfoot.”
“No—I mean—” Sirius shot him an imploring look. “Ah hell, Moony,” he said. “We’re grown ups.”
Remus raised his eyebrow at Sirius, taking in his shocked expression and the pile of cornflakes at his feet. “Well,” he said, “some of us are.”
~
“He asked me if I’d like to come up to his bedroom later and play with his goats. It’s an inventive euphemism, I’ll give him that.”
Remus choked back a laugh, shooting a glance at Aberforth and wondering if he was listening. “It’s not a euphemism,” he said quietly, and then had to choke back a shiver as Malina leant in inquisitively, and her shoulder brushed his.
~
“Fred thought I’d do it better. You get on back, Fab, I’ll handle the neph here.”
“He did not,” said Fabian Prewett, highly offended. “I’m considerably more qualified to-”
“Ah, that’s right,” said his brother with a scoff. “You were a prefect.”
“Oi, there—”
“Which is exactly why I’m a better choice,” Gideon Prewett said smugly.
“You cannot hold it over my head for all eternity.”
“Oh, can’t I?”
~
“Can I have some of Harry’s scars to eat?” he asked eagerly, pointing to the bin of edible lightning bolts.
~
“I know you can look after yourself,” he said, quickly. “But if I don’t walk you home, it’s going to make it really hard for me to kiss you goodnight on your doorstep.”
~
Lily raised an eyebrow, and James grinned in what Remus supposed was intended to be an endearing way. He bit back a chuckle at the thought that of all James’ Lily-related grins, the one he thought she found endearing was probably the dopiest. “There’s no such thing as James Potter being quiet,” Lily said, but even though she had one hand on her hip, and was attempting a glare, Remus could tell her resolve was wavering as the corners of her mouth twitched with the onset of a smile.
“No need to tell us that,” Sirius said, striding over to the table and stealing a banana out of the fruit bowl. “We had to share a room with him, remember? Don’t know why he bothered with the Invisibility Cloak – most of the time you could hear him coming long before you’d have been able to see him.”
He peeled the banana and shoved half in his mouth straight away. “Sirius Black,” Lily said. “You have the table manners of a baboon.”
“Thanks,” Sirius said, grinning widely and revealing far too much half-chewed banana for Remus’ liking.
While Lily was occupied with staring at Sirius disapprovingly, James made for the stairs. “Don’t you dare wake him,” Lily said, glaring at James accusingly. James grinned.
“I’ll be quiet as a mouse with a Muffliato spell,” he said, and took off up the stairs two at a time, making much more noise than a mouse with a Muffliato spell.
Lily rolled her eyes, and Sirius slumped down into a chair at the table, finishing the last of his banana in one bite and lazily tossing the skin over his shoulder and into the bin. Peter hovered at the work surface as if he wasn’t sure whether to offer to help Lily with the tea or not, and then smiled in relief as Lily handed him a mug and indicated that he should sit.
~
“There’s every need for sarcasm,” Remus said. “That bloody Umbridge woman and her stupid decrees. You know I’m not allowed within a hundred feet of a children’s playground now?”
Sirius’ upper lip twitched, his expression one of gentle challenge. “Do you ever go to children’s playgrounds?”
“That’s not the point,” Remus said tersely, feeling the familiar flair of Umbridge-inspired bile in his chest. “I’ve got a good mind to go and play on the swings just to spite her, have her throw me in Azkaban for swinging with intent. You know she’s been here eight times looking for you? She keeps giving me the speech about creatures of my nature being inherently untrustworthy.”
“Given that you’re harbouring a fugitive, Moony,” Sirius said, tipping his glass at him, “I’d say she had a point.”
~
“Careful’s my middle name, Moony.”
“No it’s not, it’s-–”
“Don’t you dare say that name out loud.”
~
“I bet you liked it when they called you Professor,” Sirius said, sniggering into his glass exactly as he had done the first time he’d stumbled across an edition of PlayWitch. Remus glared at him, but that just made him snigger more vociferously. 
~
“Eligible women don’t exactly cross my path on a daily basis,” Remus said, “unless you count Miss Minton from the greengrocer’s. She pinched my bottom once, after she’d had one too many sherries at Christmas.”
“Sounds promising,” Sirius said.
“She’s a hundred and five,” Remus said, rolling his eyes at Sirius and shivering at the recollection. “Hands like pincers.”
~
Sirius’ brow wrinkled in thought for a moment, and then he grinned at Remus with a mischievous glint in his eyes. “I would, you know, with you, if I was a girl. Or even now, maybe, if you get me drunk enough.”
Remus laughed, and Sirius sniggered as he snatched the bottle off the desk and refilled their glasses. “As you have the morals of a randy stoat,” Remus said, “I’m not sure I find that particularly comforting.”
Sirius looked mildly affronted for a moment, and then his expression gave way to one of a rather more puzzled nature. “Are stoats even particularly randy?” he said. “You know, more randy than weasels, say, or mink?”
“I don’t know,” Remus said.
“Then why do you keep saying it?”
“It just suits you.” Sirius seemed to accept the argument, and Remus knocked back his Firewhiskey, blinking furiously to try and bring the room back into focus. 
“I think I’m drunk,” he said, and Sirius pushed his hair out of his eyes and squinted, considering his response for a moment.
“Me too,” he said, and they both sniggered. “Do you fancy a drinking game?”
“Why not?” Remus said. It was the last thing he remembered with any real clarity.
~
“Andromeda, I simply won’t believe you a day older than twenty-seven.”
Ron scoffed. “Oh, c’mon, George, Verry’s twenty-se—” He stopped, charmingly. “And seeing you beside our lovely shop assistant, I’ve got to put you at no more than twenty-five.”
~
“He was showing her the gnomes,” said Angelina, while giving Katie a very direct look.
Katie wasn’t following. “Is that a euphemism?”
Ron snorted. “In Lee’s dreams,” he said, as Victoire crinkled her nose and opened her mouth to ask, “What’s a u-fem-”
~
“Nick one of my paws?” Sirius said, evidently horrified at the very thought.
“They’re less sensitive than hands, aren’t they?”
“What do you know about paws?” Sirius said, and Remus turned towards him slightly and raised an eyebrow in disbelief. “All right,” Sirius said, in a terse but rather apologetic tone, “you might know a thing or two, but you can’t really compare them – I mean you’ve got hardened wolfy paws and mine are more – delicate. Domestic.”
“Oh for—” Remus stopped as a passer-by eyed him – apparently talking to himself – with suspicion. He patted the pockets of his trousers, rolling his eyes in mock-exasperation, hoping to suggest that he was annoyed with himself for forgetting something.
~
Moody was getting exceptionally vociferous about the importance of maintaining basic security procedures, which, according to him, included not accepting food even from people you considered to be good friends. Molly Weasley bristled in her seat and eyed the empty plates on the table with something approaching panic, as if she thought Mad-Eye was accusing her personally, but even that wasn’t enough to really hold Remus’ attention because, besides anything else, he remembered the lecture from the first war.
~
“What’s the worst that can happen?”
“She says no, laughs in my face – or worse – and I’m plunged into a deep pit of depression when I realise I’ve got nothing left to live for, and spend the rest of my days crippled by an unerring, foggy despair.”
~
“Go out with you?” she said, her tone high and surprised. All the muscles in his body tensed.
“Forget I said it,” he said quickly.
“I don’t want to.”
“Go out with me?” he asked, not entirely surprised at the disappointed tinge to his voice.
“Forget you said it,” she said softly.
~
“It was raining in London,” she said, avoiding his eyes. She whipped out her wand and started to dry her sleeves. 
His lips twitched in amusement. “Did you not think to conjure an umbrella?”
“Does it look like I thought to conjure an umbrella?”
~
When she finally caught up with him, he looked mildly miffed. “Forgive me,” he said, “but I’ve always been lead to believe that splitting up involved you being in one place and me being somewhere else.”
~
“He knows the drill,” Remus said. “I’ll lift it when he promises to behave. Are you going to be good?”
Sirius made a hand gesture across the table that made Tonks snigger. “A little while longer, then,” Remus said, stashing his wand back in his pocket.  ~
“You’re infuriating,” she said. “If I had something to throw, I’d be throwing it at you right now.”
Happy to oblige, Remus gave her a good-natured smile, took out his wand and conjured a pillow. He tossed it to her. She sneered at him, and then whacked him on the head with it. Having had much worse inflicted on him over the years by infuriated Marauders, he didn’t even bother to raise his arms defensively, which she seemed to find absolutely maddening. She whacked him again. “You said you were going to throw it at me, not beat me with it,” he said.
“Can we have less of your pedanticness, please?” she said, swatting him with the pillow again and ruffling his hair into his eyes.
He caught the pillow and looked at her over the top of it through his fringe, trying desperately not to smile. “The word,” he said slowly, “is ‘pedantry’.”
“Gah!” Her eyes flashed with desperate annoyance and she wrestled the pillow from his grip, and hit him on the head with it, three times, in quick succession. He laughed. So she hit him again. At least that’s what he assumed it was for. 
“Are you quite finished?” he said.
“No,” she said. She swatted him on the shoulder another couple of times and then sank back in her chair.
“How about now?”
“Yes,” she said. She clutched the pillow to her chest and shot him a sulky glower over the top.
~
“Drooling on the—I wasn’t drooling on anything.”
“I’ve got a damp patch on my shirt that says otherwise,” he said, attempting to sound utterly bored and distracted. “I suppose you’ve conveniently forgotten needing to be carried upstairs?”
“I didn’t need to be carried upstairs. I just—”
“Let me do it for fun?”
She let out a quick sigh of irritation. “I did not need carrying upstairs.”
“Yes, it did seem that way,” he said, lazily turning an unread page, “when you were drooling on the table.”
~
“Duly noted. Have a nice day. And do try not to die.”
“As if you’d care if I did,” she muttered.
“Of course I would,” he said. “You’ve still got my copy of Jane Eyre.”
She offered him one of the slack-jawed glowers he thought she probably saved especially for him before turning on her heel and marching for the door. He felt a sudden and rather acute stab of guilt.
“And I would miss you,” he said, quickly. As she turned back to face him, Tonks looked genuinely shocked. He met her eye. “Very much,” he added, softly. “So I’d consider it a favour if you didn’t get distracted and came back in one piece.”
~
“Well, not a peace offering, I suppose. More of an apology for kicking you in the shin and calling you an infuriating bastard last week.”
“I’d have thought if you were going to apologise for any of your colourful insults, the one about me being me a pathetic, evasive, emotionally-crippled wanker is the more deserving.”
~
“The first time, there may have been dancing,” he said. “And some slight stripping.”
“You?” she said, eyes wide.
“Yes.”
“Stripping?”
“Slight stripping.”
“Slight?” she said. “How do you strip slightly?”
“Someone stopped me before I got too far,” he said. “If you want the full story you’ll have to ask Sirius,” he said, wincing at the images than danced through his mind. “My memory of the details is a little vague.”
~
“You want me to take my clothes off?” he asked cautiously.
“Not necessarily,” she said. “I might just have been asking for a general gage of how much fun you’re going to be.”
“Oh.”
She leant back in her chair and stretched, wiggling her shoulders around in their sockets before settling. “I’m going to take your ‘oh’ – which I felt was ever so slightly tinged with disappointment – as a sign that you want me to want you to take your clothes off, though,” she said, leaning forward and grinning at him impishly. “Just so you know.”
~
“You know what I hate about you?” Tonks said, into her lime as she bit it, shaking her head a little at the taste.
“I’ve been led to believe there are a great many things,” he said.
~
“You’re up bright and early,” he said, and Sirius shrugged.
“Had to get up so I could be sick,” he said.
Remus offered him a vague grimace of sympathy, although he wondered if it shouldn’t be disapproval. “So what’s going on, then?” Sirius said, gesturing to the wardrobe. “Were you looking for woodworm?”
Remus debated his options – he could lie, claim he’d found a Doxy nest or something, but Sirius probably wouldn’t believe him, and besides anything else, Remus had been staring at his range of grey, brown, and greyish-brown jumpers for half an hour, and was still no closer to deciding which one was appropriate attire, and he thought a second opinion might be necessary. He took a deep breath.
“If a person was going out with another person,” he said, “what might they wear?”
“What?” Sirius said, his brow creasing with confusion. Remus sighed, knowing he’d probably never hear the end of this.
“If a person–”
“Look, Moony,” Sirius said, “I’ve got a stinking hangover, someone’s hidden my Morning After Mintimisers—” Remus fingered the packet guiltily in his pocket. “ –so I’m really not in the mood for cryptic. Do you mean you?”
“All right, yes,” he said. “If a person—” Sirius glowered, cutting Remus off. He rolled his eyes, and re-phrased. “ –if I was going out with another person—”
~
“And of course you and James made everything easier by ribbing me about it at every turn and making kissing noises behind my back.”
“That’s what mates are for,” Sirius said. “And it could have been worse – I mean we had that confetti charm over the front door rigged to go off when you were leaving with her, and we didn’t use it as a mark of respect.”
“Hmm,” Remus said. “As I recall, you didn’t use it because James got distracted by Lily and forgot to send the signal.”
~
“Wear those,” Sirius said abruptly, and Remus turned to see him pointing at the darker pair of grey trousers. Remus pulled out the hanger, and gestured to them, raising an eyebrow at Sirius in question. “They make your arse look nice.”
Remus nearly dropped the hanger in surprise, and eyed Sirius aghast. “Have you been – when have you noticed my arse?”
Sirius rolled his eyes. “Well it is in plain view a great deal of the time, Moony. I just notice these things. Nothing wrong with that.”
Remus swallowed. He supposed that was true, although he was a little disconcerted that Sirius might have formed an opinion. “What?” Sirius said defensively. “Now a man can’t look at another man’s posterior without him getting snippy about it?”
“I’m not—”
“I was just paying you a compliment. And you want it to look nice, don’t you?”
“Well, yes, I suppose,” Remus said, a little flummoxed by the tone the conversation had adopted. His brow dipped thoughtfully. “And they really—”
“Like a peach in a hanky.”
~
“Oh,” Remus said. “I didn’t realise they’d been married that long.”
“Neither did dad,” Tonks said. “Mum went mental when she realised he’d forgotten.”
“He forgot?” Remus said, aghast, some of his unease abating.
“Hmm,” Tonks replied, meeting his eye askance, hers twinkling ever so slightly. “He came home from work and asked what all the owls were for, apparently, and when mum started turning his work robes into mashed potato, he got the idea that maybe he’d missed something.”
~
“Would you run naked round the garden?” she said, her eyes glittering with mischief as she watched his reaction. 
“Yes,” he whispered. “Although I’d have to be careful, what with all those rose bushes. I could do myself a terrible mischief on the thorns.”
Tonks tittered quietly, gripping the plate firmly in an attempt not to drop them. “Would you snog Doris? The one with the lazy eye who smells of bruise-healing salve and damp dog.”
“Ah,” Remus said, taking in the witch in question. He met Tonks’ eye again and raised an eyebrow. “For the whole plate?” She nodded. “And when you say snog—”
“With tongues.”
Remus sniggered, even though he thought sniggering in a man of his age over the words ‘snog’ and ‘tongues’ was a bit unseemly. “Yes,” he said, and Tonks gaped at him. “Support stockings aside, she’s quite a looker.”
~
“There’s two ways this can go, James,” Remus said. “Either we leave you alone to sulk for a bit and then you get bored of sulking and tell us what’s up, or you just tell us now and save us all a lot of hassle.”
~
“She didn’t spurn my advances,” Sirius said, leaning on the wall next to the window and crossing his arms.
“You told me she said she’d rather dig out her own eyes with a trowel than go out with you.”
“And she did,” Sirius said, ignoring the puzzled glances the others shot each other. “But she said it with a twinkle in her eye.” James hummed in consideration, looking entirely unconvinced that that was a recipe for romantic success. “She’s warming to me.”
“I don’t think so. Girls don’t really use the word ‘trowel’ at all when they’re actually interested in someone.”
~
“What are you smiling at?” Sirius said. “I thought we were moping?”
“We were,” Remus said. “And now we’re not.”
He could barely contain his excitement, and so he didn’t even try. He got up from his chair, and placed an exaggerated, noisy kiss on Sirius’ forehead, affectionately ruffling his hair. “What was that for?” Sirius said, looking utterly stunned as he flopped back in his chair, wiping at his forehead with the back of his hand.
“Because you, Sirius Black, are a bloody genius,” Remus said, retreating from the table and up the stairs.
“Am I?” Sirius said, and then grinned. “Well, I suppose it has been said….”
“Back in a minute,” Remus called over his shoulder as he reached the door. “Please don’t pass out while I’m gone – there’s a chance I might need your expertise.”
~
“Well if you hadn’t gone and bloody died–”
“Oh kettle, Black calling, Potter,” Sirius said tersely. “You’re not so alive yourself.”
James sniggered. “I do dead with more panache, though,” he said. “At least I didn’t fall through a bloody curtain—” 
“Veil of Death,” Sirius said, glaring. “Not ‘a bloody curtain’. And I didn’t fall—I was pushed. By a hex!”
~
The poignancy of the moment was rather ruined by James shouting “Tell her Moony!” and Sirius chiming in with a “you useless moping tosser!”
~
“You know I never really got that either,” he said. “It always implied to me that it’s OK to laugh at a dead dragon—”
“Exactly—”
“–which is just cruel, really—”
“–although if they don’t like being laughed at, making sure they’ve carked it first is one method of self-preservation—”
“–because why would anyone find a dead dragon amusing?”
Sirius frowned in thought. “I’ve never really given a shit about dragons, dead, live or otherwise,” he said, waving at the room dramatically to illustrate some point he thought he was making, “unless they were flaring their nostrils and threatening to incinerate me – but that’s a damn good point.”
“Thank you,” Remus said, tipping his pint glass in Sirius’ direction in acknowledgement.
“And say you were faced with a live dragon,” Sirius mused, frown deepening, “why would you be laughing at it, and not, say, running like buggery in the other direction?”
~
“Isn’t it?” Sirius pressed his lips together in thought, finally managing to get his elbow onto the table and his face in his palm. “Which proverb am I thinking about, then?”
Remus shook his head. He wasn’t really sure how any of this pertained to his situation, but he did know that when Sirius started getting proverbial, it was normally time to pass out, and the table top was really starting to look very appealing. “It’s not the one about eggs in a basket, because you’re not putting your eggs anywhere – and it’s not the one about glass and stones, I don’t think…. And it’s not the one about friends and enemies – although that’s a bloody good one.”
~
“There’s a tree,” Sirius says, pointing, “in the drawing room.”
Remus’ eyes follow his finger, and then widen. “Oh,” he says. He thinks for a moment, and then says, “Did you put it there..?”
Sirius rolls his eyes. “Would I be this surprised if I had?”
~
Somewhere inside, Remus knew that ‘nbleurgh’ wasn’t a real word, and that shaking his head violently after a mouthful of Firewhiskey wasn’t a particularly manly thing to do. However, he couldn’t really find it within himself to care about either.
~
“Honestly?” Remus said. “I’ve no idea.”
Lily raised an eyebrow, the corners of her mouth twitching in the beginnings of a smile. “How drunk were you?”
“I’ve no idea about that either,” Remus said, “which is always a worrying sign.”
Lily sniggered, and Remus closed his eyes for a second, letting out a slow sigh and leaning back against the doorframe. “About earlier,” he said. “I’m sorry you had to see—” He cleared his throat, wondering what the appropriate term might be. “ – that.”
“Oh don’t be daft,” she said, “although if I’d known you were so nice to look at without your clothes on, I might have insisted on that torrid affair after all.”
~
The word was out of Remus’ mouth before he’d had chance to really consider it, and in truth the answer surprised him a little. “What do I do for a maybe?” he said, lifting his glass to eye-level to examine it. “Half a shot? If I fancied him,” he said. “If I fancied someone, I wouldn’t just not kiss them because they happened to be a man. I mean it seems a little foolhardy,” he continued, wondering if he’d got all the syllables of ‘foolhardy’ in the right place, “to rule out an entire sex just for the sake of it.”
~
Remus ran a hand over his face, his eyes roving Sirius’ for any hint of what had actually happened. “You’re not going to tell me, are you?” he said, and Sirius laughed.
“Where’d be the fun in that?” he said. “It’s your own fault, anyway. If you weren’t such a drunkard, you wouldn’t need me to tell you what you did or didn’t do.”
~
“Merlin,” he said, sinking into a chair. “I slept with a banshee.”
“How could you not have noticed?” Remus said, positively aghast.
“It was dark!”
Remus rolled his eyes. “It’s never that dark,” he muttered.
Sirius slumped in his chair, dropping his head into his hands. “How was I to know?” he said glumly. “I just thought she was thin and a bit goth.” Remus made a face of appalled disbelief, and Tonks sniggered into her hand. ~ “What, you mean like in one of those Muggle films that have flying…trains or what d’you call it?” He pantomimed with his hands excitedly. “Like the one where the thing bursts out of a bloke when he’s just trying to have a decent breakfast—”
“He’s not an alien,” said Hermione. “And I told you not to watch that film.”
~
“I said nothing of the sort! I said I needed potions ingredients. You are the one who must turn everything into some sort of…into something…”
“I believe the word you’re searching for,” murmured Dumbledore, “is fun.”
~
“Tell Fred what you did when you found out Ginny was pregnant, Ron!” Hermione was practically bouncing.
Ron looked uncomfortable. “I don’t remember,” he muttered.
Hermione threw a glare at him before saying, “Imagine a nice, family dinner at the Burrow. Harry and Ginny had been married for two years, so it really shouldn’t have been such a surprise that they’d had sex,” she said the word with relish, and Ron’s ears turned red. “They made their announcement, and just as Mum was getting weepy and emotional, Ron lunged across the table, scattering food everywhere—”
“Not everywhere, it was mostly just on me—”
“He didn’t even get to Harry, who just stood there, gaping at him, and started laughing like a loon. Poor Ginny was so embarrassed...”
All of them roared with laughter while Ron muttered “baby sister” and “wasn’t thinking.”
~
“There’s nothing’ hypothetical about it!” Scotty exclaimed. “My sandwiches are proof of that!”
~
“This is stupid,” Uhura hissed.
“You want your boots to be next?” Jim demanded, eyes bright in the dimness. The unabashedly gleeful look on his face was making Scotty a bit nervous.
“Why can’t we sit in an office and watch through the security cameras?” she wanted to know.
“Because we might miss it!”
“The giant alien rat.”
“Whatever it is,” Spock interrupted firmly, “if indeed there even is an ‘it’ at all, we would have much less of a chance of catching it if we were hidden in the security office.”
“I can’t believe you’re on his side,” Uhura said.
“Neither can I,” Spock replied, not missing a beat.
“I’m disappointed in you, Spock,” Jim sighed.
~
“Oh, no...” Howard dissented. “Knowing you, we’d end up playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl on with Rock Band controllers again.”
~ “Pavel, you are eleven years old, and whether you like it or not, you are little and always have been,” Elena snapped, knowing that Pavel wouldn’t take it personally. It was his own fault for forgetting to eat and he knew it.
~
“You have permission to swear,” Dolores said, looking murderous as she picked up the note. Percy did so.
“For someone who seems so stodgy and by-the-book, you can be surprisingly creative,” Baxley commented, a little too brightly. Umbridge glared at him like some sort of toad about to eat a particularly vexing fly.
~
Very severely, Percy said, “It is nonsense. We are clearly dealing with some loon.”
Umbridge pursed her lips. “We much have someone put out a notice in the newspaper. We shall ask for information about a… what is this flower at the bottom?”
“A scarlet pimpernel,” Percy replied. “I looked it up.”
“Well, ask if anyone knows of a madman escaped from Azkaban who thinks that he’s a small red flower. Mulciber and Macnair will be relieved from their posts. This is crazy. Percy, see if you can get anything out of the other Ministries on an influx of British witches and wizards.”
~ These notes, of course, were so heavily warded that Hermes looked dizzy when he flew off with them, but it was a necessary precaution. 
~
She did not appear to be fully convinced and she leaned back in her chair, arms crossed almost directly underneath what passed for the collar of her robes. Percy stared at the spot in between her eyes on her forehead and refused to look down. It was very difficult and Percy had to force himself to remember the time he’d walked in on his parents— urgh. That did it.
~
“And I’ll have to provide them with some means of livelihood.”
“If you let them starve your humanitarian efforts would be a bit pointless.”
~
“May I say then, that you refused to listen to reason? You can tell your higher-ups that the British Ministry’s demands were absurd and damaging to the French economy.”
“Agreed. Ooh, say that I broke a carafe of wine over your head. I’ve always wanted to have done something like that.” She poured wine over Percy’s head to add to the verisimilitude, but Percy balked at having glass fragments in his skull.
“You dodged?” Madame de la Cœur suggested. “I flung the wine at you and you dodged before the bottle followed.”
“Oh, alright,” Percy said, as Madame de la Coeur smashed the bottle against the wall.
“You refuse to see reason?” Percy shouted, flinging open the door, to the shock of the Ministry employees very pointedly not listening outside Madame de la Coeur’s office.
~
“Hey, Percy,” Oliver said, dropping into a chair by Percy’s bed. “Apparently the nurses alerted me as your next of kin.”
“That’s really quite strange,” Percy said. “I’m not quite sure why they would.”
“Because your family disowned you?” Oliver suggested.
“Well, there is that.”
~
“Oh, I say!” Percy protested, rather feebly, before realizing Eloise had been honestly, truly upset over him. It was… strange. He patted her on the back. “There, there.”
Oliver attempted to eat his own fist again to keep from laughing.
“Mmph,” Oliver said around his fist.
Eloise looked at him. “Is he okay?”
“He’s just suffering from chronic stupidity. Always had it. Nothing to worry about, Eloise.”
~
He then sat through about an hour of Eloise reading their tea leaves (would you look at that? Percy was going to have a son. Soon.), reading the Tarot cards (mortal danger, mortal danger, oh! Look at that! Percy was going to have a son again), and peering into the crystal ball (Eloise insisted that she saw Percy with an infant and then hinted that in order to have an infant, he really needed to get married first and was that giving him any ideas?).
~
Oliver returned five minutes later, looking completely unconcerned. Percy raised his eyebrows and Oliver tripped over his own feet, knocking the treacle tart onto the Minister of Magic himself. As Oliver apologized volubly and rubbed the treacle deeper into the Minister’s robes, Percy hexed everyone’s drinks.
~
“Oliver! You can’t- look, you have no reason to throw away your life—”
Oliver, pulling a clean shirt on, pointedly turned on the radio. “What was that? I couldn’t hear your stupid protests.”
~
“Go to hell,” Percy said amicably, neither looking at Ginny nor moving his stick. “Go very quickly on a thestral.”
“Your insults are crap.”
~
“Charlie,” their father said suddenly. “Charlie, catch the—” Charlie dove and caught the baby just as Mrs. Tonks caught sight of her daughter and Remus Lupin lying, dead, side-by-side, on the tables.
~
“Charlie, you grew up with five younger siblings and you have no idea what to do with a smelly infant?”
~
“Yeah, but… it’s suddenly just dawned on me that there may be more to life than Quiddich.” Oliver looked absolutely horrified. “What if people stop caring about Quidditch, Percy? What then?”
~
Percy tried to smile and ended up saying, “You’re an awfully good League, Oliver.”
“You’re a good Scarlet Pimpernel,” Oliver said back gamely. Then, like every pair of British twenty-somethings vaguely ashamed of their feelings, they avoided eye contact and pretended that the moment had never happened.
~
“I’ll go see if I can find his things, shall I? If he starts crying, just rock him.”
“Rock him?” Oliver asked, completely bewildered.
“I’ll go quickly then.”
~
“A sea cucumber,” Percy replied brightly. “I transfigured the Minister of Magic into a sea urchin. I thought it appropriate to keep with a nautical theme. Did you know, sea cucumbers aren’t actually vegetables? They are echinoderms, a type of marine animal. I’m very fond of echinoderms. Look at the sea cucumber Teddy!”
“You’re in a very interesting mental state right now, aren’t you, Percy?” Shacklebolt asked.
“Oh indeed sir,” Percy replied. “I haven’t slept since… what day is today?”
“Couldn’t tell you.”
~
Percy didn’t really tell Oliver anything, except that he, Percy, had adopted Teddy. Oliver told him that they were on the front page. They stared at each other rather awkwardly. They then decided to get completely smashed, because they couldn’t figure out what else to do.
~
“I shouldn’t give this to you. You planning on Apparating out? You bloody youngsters. When I was your age—”
“Goats,” Percy interrupted, since he had had access to all the files in the Ministry of Magic for quite some time now. Aberforth promptly shut up.
~ “When is the last time you went grocery shopping, Oliver?”
“Mrs. Weasley feeds me. Look, when a bloke charges into deadly danger and continually throws himself in the way of mortal peril, he doesn’t have much time to nip down to the stores to pick up chips and cucumbers!”
~
Bill suddenly snorted. “Percy! I don’t believe it! You’re sloshed!”
“No,” said Percy, a little nettled. “I was sloshed. Now I’m hung-over.”
Now, really, Percy thought, Bill’s grin was just obscene. It wasn’t fair having two older brothers if one of them was Bill.
“I didn’t think you had it in you,” Bill exclaimed warmly. “Perfect prefect Percy- completely smashed!”
“Is it so hard to believe I have a social life?” Percy demanded. “Don’t answer that!”
~ “Yes dear,” Bill said automatically. Percy supposed this boded rather well for Bill’s married life.
~
Oliver, predictably, was still trying to get dressed. He had some difficulty with this because Alicia was busy being sick in his bathroom and Percy was relatively sure Angelina had hidden Oliver’s shoes out of spite.
“With Alicia Spinnet!” Angelina spat out. “Alicia Spinnet!”
Oliver held his head in his hands. “Good God woman, I’m too hung-over for this! What the hell do you have against me?”
“Hallo,” Percy interjected rather hastily, stuffing a pacifier in Teddy’s mouth. “Oliver, ready to go?”
Oliver looked at him blearily. “Percy, I don’t have any shoes.”
“I’m sure you do. Have you checked your closet? How about under the bed? Your shoes always end up under the bed.”
“And Percy Weasley, Oliver?” Angelina roared. “You’re an item with Percy Weasley and you seduced me AND Laic?”
“Why does everyone keep thinking that?” Percy asked, nettled. “You know, Oliver, I think Ginny’s told everyone she knows we’re together too.”
“What good is being a Quiddich star and a world-renowned humanitarian dare-devil if everyone thinks you’re gay for your best mate?”
“Probably not very much,” Percy replied. “Sorry about all this Angelina. This is Teddy Lupin and I adopted him yesterday since his parents are dead and his grandma’s become a nutter. Neither of us is gay, as far as we know, and yes, yes, Oliver is a git for taking advantage of you when you were still emotionally vulnerable after Fred’s death and for now ruining your friendship with Alicia—”
“—because Alicia’s liked you for ages, Oliver and how d’you think she felt when she heard you were a homosexual and attracted to me instead of her?”
“Confused?” asked Oliver. “I’d be confused.”
“Look, here’s a pair of shoes,” said Percy, pointing to behind the umbrella stand. His head was beginning to ache viciously again. “Oliver, it’s a quarter to three. We really have to go. I still haven’t figured out the wards Shacklebolt wants to put up in the Ministry, so if we just Apparate to the Ministry lobby—”
“Oh no you don’t,” Angelina said savagely, leaping at the shoes.
“Accio Oliver’s shoes,” Percy said wearily, pointing his wand at them. “Come off it Angelina. There is a time and a place for violent, emotional confrontation and it is not when I’m hung-over and going to be late for tea with the heads of magical Europe.”
~ Ron had beat Neville at chess twice now. The black chess pieces that Neville was using were beginning to get disgruntled. Neville, however, took it all in a stride. He cheerfully continued to send most of his pieces to their doom and pretended not to notice when one of his bishops called him a rude name.

“Hey,” Ron said conversationally as he took one of Neville’s pawns, “did you know you’re on a Chocolate Frog card?”
~
Hermione pulled a pristine, three-layer chocolate cake out of the handbag. Ron, who was accustomed to the strange inner workings of Hermione’s handbag, did not bat an eyelash. Neville gaped.
~
“I live just up there,” the boy said, pointing down the road. Through the trees, Ron could make out a big red farmhouse a few yards up the road. “Besides, Granny said to be home before dark. There’s still a little light out. I was going to go exploring in the forest…”
“No, you are not going to go exploring in the ruddy forest,” Ron said firmly. “It’s almost dark and I don’t want it to be my fault if you end up getting lost in there and then eaten by a giant spider or something.”
~
“She’s a teenager, they keep secrets.” Dad’s voice was rational and soothing. “I didn’t tell my mother about you until we’d been dating for a year.”
“You think I’m like your mother?” Mum sounded horrified.
“Good God, no!” Dad, too, sounded horrified at the thought.
~ The back door of the cottage slammed shut and Ron and Hermione jumped apart. Ron glanced over to see Harry crossing the lawn with Kreacher, who was carrying a tray laden with sandwiches. Harry seemed to be speaking in an unnecessarily loud voice to the house-elf, as if he wanted to be certain that Ron and Hermione would hear their approach.
~ “Can I, Grandpa? I’ll be right back and I won’t go into the forest, I promise. I promise for real this time.”
~
“You’re not putting flowers in my sitting room,” Harry said vehemently as she conjured a bouquet in a sunny yellow pot and tried to set it on the table. Harry had continued to be irritable over the past few days, which probably meant that he still had not made up with Ginny.
Hermione sighed and put a hand on her hip. “Why not?”
Harry frowned at the flowers. “They’re too…feminine.” Hermione impatiently waved her wand. The flowers seemed to crumple into themselves, and then new petals burst forth in hues of scarlet and gold. Harry continued to frown. “Now they just look unnatural.”
“Well yes, Harry,” Hermione said wryly. “I created them with magic, you see.”
~
“No, no, no,” said Percy, frustrated. “We want to go to Level Two!”
“Level Eight, Atrium,” the disembodied voice repeated firmly.
~ “Pleasure to meet you, Potter. Bang-up job you’ve been doing over here, saving the world and whatnot.”
~
“I know,” Harry said quickly, “but I’m sure that I can pass all the practical tests—”
“You require N.E.W.T.’s in the core subjects in order to pass the practical examinations,” Proudfoot snapped. “There are requirements for a reason!”
Brigs snorted. “It’s Harry bloody Potter, Angus.” The majority of the Aurors had abandoned all attempts of even pretending to be busy and were now blatantly eavesdropping.
~
“But…but…you have no experience teaching!” Proudfoot spluttered. “And very little experience in practical Defence - you deal with Dark objects, not wizards!”
“Oh, and you think that Dark objects don’t come attached with their share of Dark witches and wizards and hags and vampires and all sorts?” Brigs said, looking miffed. “I’ve had plenty of experience, thank you.”
~
Harry suddenly heard footsteps rustling in the tall grass behind them. He quickly rolled off Ginny, his heart hammering in his chest. As he looked up, the only thing that was going through his mind was the mantra, Please don’t be Mr Weasley, please don’t be Mr Weasley, please don’t be Mr Weasley…
“Hello,” said Luna Lovegood, looking frankly unembarrassed to be in this situation. “Thought I would pay you a visit today, Harry.”
~
“You honestly think I should say, ‘While I respect your lifestyle and appreciate the courage it takes to be out in the world today, I myself prefer the company of women.’ You think I should say that?”
~
Her fathers (the William-Blakes, the Blake-Willams or ‘just Alex and Joseph, please’ depending on who was making the introductions), discovered a ghost in the living room two weeks ago The ghost wasn’t violent, yet, but it had been keeping everyone awake with incessant piano playing, and they wanted it gone. Dean was up for any gig that allowed him to set things on fire, and the William-Blakes, Blake-Willams insisted on paying them in clean beds and home-cooked meals.
~
The guy’s name was Brent, and he was a writer (or maybe he’d said pastry chef) and his partner’s name was Michael (or had it been Mario?) and he ran a web site (or maybe it was a dojo). Dean hadn’t paid much attention during introductions. Sam hung between them, just teetering on the edge of consciousness, with his head resting on Brent’s (Brian’s? Bartleby’s?) shoulder. The younger hunter was covered in a thick purple slime that flattened his hair, and soaked his clothes, but both the author (pastry chef?) and his web page running (dojo owning?) partner were covered in the same stuff.
“Hey Sammy,” Dean said with a grin. The gun was still warm in Dean’s hand, and he slid the piece into the waiting holster before lifting his little brother’s head up to meet his eyes. “You’re dripping with goo.” Dean laughed, but he didn’t feel too weird about it since Brent the pastry making author (because maybe Dean had hear both and the guy was just really good at multitasking) snorted a little, though the snort may just have been him blowing purple goo out of his nose. Sam, glassy eyed and fading didn’t respond. 
“I think you should take him to the hospital,” Michael (Mitch?) responded, helping to transfer Sam over to his brother’s hold. Dean hooked his arms under Sam’s arm pits. His younger brother’s knees buckled and he toppled forward, nothing but dead weight in Dean’s arms, his nose pressed into Dean’s neck.
“I liked your book,” Sam mumbled.
“Sammy, it’s me.”
“Oh. Tell him I liked his book.” Dean rolled his eyes.
“Ah, thanks for the help guys,” Dean said fighting to find a better grip. Ribbons of purple sludge hung off the two men. One of the ribbons snapped and hit the concrete with a wet slap. Sam slipped and Dean’s own knees buckled in his attempt to keep him upright. “That stuff should wash right off. It’s not toxic or anything.” The two men exchanged a glance.

“Kissing is gross,” Jason informed them with the sort of certainty only children possessed. “Do you have to do it in front of us?”

“Master Wayne, I must apologize. I seem to have forgotten to pack your manners. Should I return to Gotham and retrieve them?” Alfred questioned sarcastically.
“That won’t be necessary, Alfred.” Bruce smirked. “I have a feeling I wont need them.”
“Very well then,” Alfred said placing the suitcases into the truck of the limousine. “should I place out you’re your other suit so you may conduct tonight’s business?”
“What’s wrong with this one?” Bruce asked Alfred over the top of the car as the both slid into opposite sides of the back seat. “This colour brings out my eyes.”
“Yes, I agree whole heartedly that this particularly colour is most stunning on you…” Alfred stated as he moved into the seat and shut the door. “But that specific blend of fabrics has never been particularly bullet proof, sir.”
~
“Perhaps I should see if these men have the necessary documentation to visit our fair city. It would be such a pity if those papers were forged or missing entirely. Better still if the police discovered that fact, along with … stolen property, perhaps. I think it can be arranged.”
~ During the Year That Never Was, Martha meets someone whom she will meet several times. Or whom she has met several times? Non-linear time always made her head hurt.
~
“Seriously, where the hell did you meet Bruce?”
“Tibet. In a converted temple full of ninjas.”
“Ninjas.”
“Yes. In Tibet.”
“Ninjas.”
“Where did you think he learned the crazy karate, hang-gliding-in-the-inner-city stuff?”
“Ninjas?”
“Yes.”
“So what were you doing there?”
“The same thing he was.”
“You’re a ninja?”
“Technically?” he shrugged,” Yes.”
“Superman the ninja. There’s something nobody expected.”
~
“Hey, whatever works,” Kent chuckled. “Some days, I need you around to talk some hard truth into me; some days you need me around so that you can beat the crap out of a crowbar.”
~
She smiled, nodded, and jotted it down on her clipboard, before looking at him, expectantly. “Sub-species?” He gave her a blank look. “Which strain of human are you?”
~
“Order of business?” said one of the occupants of the room disbelievingly. “There are three of us in this room, Hermione. It’s not any kind of official meeting.”
~
She leaned back as if to study him, still swaying, and concluded, “Your hair bothers him.”
“My hair?” he repeated, grinning.
“You have very nice hair.”
“I know I have very nice hair…”
“Yes,” Gideon Prewett interceded dryly from over Sirius’ shoulder, “everyone in the room is aware that Sirius Black has very nice hair. I would like to add that Gideon Prewett also happens to have reasonably attractive hair which thankfully does not stick up—”
“Oi!” objected Potter, swinging by close enough to hear the jibe for his benefit. He stopped in mid-step, Lily halting abruptly with him and from the shade of her face, matching perfectly with her hair, seemed on the brink of strangling him.
“Even if it does not swing gracefully into my eyes with magical shine—”
“Oi, I do not use—” Sirius’ hand slid off of Marlene’s waist and with a faint sigh she stepped away, smile leaping to her face. “James, tell Prewett I don’t enchant my hair!”
James thought about this. “Do you enchant your hair?”
~
“And I love you, Potter, but if you get yourself killed it’ll be difficult for us to keep going out.”
He seemed to take this warning under consideration. “How about maimed?” he teased.
“Try to steer clear of maimings, too,” she advised. “You know I only put up with you because you’re cute.”
“Rakishly handsome,” he amended. “I know.”
~
“It sounded like it to Sirius and me.”
“Sirius and I,” Sturgis offered helpfully. Gideon and Lily exchanged glances, their mouths forcibly turning down. Podmore seemed to realize he’d miscalculated, changing the subject back. “If the Durmstrangers are becoming involved, we have a problem.”
~
“Yeah, but the whips’ ideas of not damaged and mine, they differ a bit, Gideon.”
Fabian sighed long-sufferingly. “Fabian.”
“Seriously? No, sorry, really…”
“We aren’t really that hard to tell apart,” he said mournfully, although these days that wasn’t quite as true. The eyes were still different shades but Gideon had always been fairer, Fabian darker. Neither was getting much sun these days, so Fabian was paler and Gideon’s hair duskier than most were accustomed to. At first glance they were getting mixed up more often or not, a problem they hadn’t had since childhood except around Sirius Black. “But then you are drunk, aren’t you, Sirius?”
~
The man shrugged in idle exasperation. “You’d think a man can laugh aloud on his flying motorcycle without getting pulled over because a couple of whips think he’s cloud cuckoo land material.”
Fabian digested that. “Please never say that sentence again,” he advised.
~
The tailor didn’t advertise. He was tucked into a concrete hive of shops off Haider Road that had either been decaying for a decade or were waiting forlornly for construction to be completed.

“It seems very far away,” said Chang, scowling.
“Very near,” she countered. “Only three or seven hours away.”

“Well,” said the paramedic, ogling two scantily clad girls as they walked past, “there are benefits to the heat.”
“If there’s a god,” replied his partner, “they’ll get heat stroke in the next ten steps.”

“Might be better to trust Detective Marks on this one. She’s more than a pretty face, you know. There’s also her legs. And she smells nice.”
~
“Damn, and I haven’t even sent in the insurance papers from your last accident yet.”
“Actually, sir, I believe Oz was just about to type those up.”
“Really? I thought you were going to—”
“It wasn’t my fault, sir.”
“Our fault. It wasn’t our fault.”
~
“Oh, I practically forgot. I am chairman, aren’t I? That means I can give you orders, doesn’t it?”
“Of course it does. And, I encourage you to start, if only to see how far your authority goes.”
~
“Yeah, we figured out why they hit those banks ages ago. Tell me something I don’t know.”
“Mary Queen of Scots’ croquet mallet was made of narwhal horn.”
~
“What luck indeed,” Sophie muttered now as she glowered at the Parry backyard. “Maybe I’ll just shave Morgan’s head.”
Fortunately, Morgan picked that moment to burst forth with a high, keening wail, preventing Howl from hearing Sophie’s appalling suggestion.
“My word, you do have strong vocal chords, don’t you,” Howl observed, as if this was the first time Morgan had ever screamed. He scooped Morgan up in his arms, and made his way over to Sophie.
Sophie sighed. “Howl, you know he doesn’t like to have his feet played with.”
“That’s preposterous! Utter nonsense! It’s all this talk of sticking him with dirt-collared hair that’s riled him,” Howl fixed Sophie with an accusing look, but the corners of his lips twitched upwards ever so slightly. Sophie stroked Morgan’s head in an attempt to soothe him, running her fingers through the shock of brown fluff that had become the source of such contention. Sophie rather liked his hair colour—it made her think of a rich, creamy chocolate. Of course, when she had told Howl this, he had remarked that the only thing worse than having mud-collared hair was having food-collared hair.
~
“Only words with more than four syllables can properly express how enchanting you are,” Howl murmured. When Sophie didn’t immediately say anything more, Howl seized the opportunity to kiss her. But at the last second, she turned her head so that he ended up with his face buried in a mass of her ginger curls.
“Hmph,” Sophie grunted, pushing him away and marching around behind the telly. “There aren’t enough syllables in the world to properly express how full of it you are.”
~
“I didn’t kidnap him,” Salome countered. “I borrowed him.”
“I wasn’t aware one could borrow children,” he told her dryly.
~
“We see that,” Paige said. “Do you feel light-headed or anything?”
His brow furrowed. “What are you talking about?”
“We need to figure out if you’ve been conceived or if they need to go at it again,” Paige told him matter-of-factly.
“I started to disappear earlier,” Chris said, addressing himself to Paige and Phoebe only. “But then I reappeared entirely, so I’m pretty sure that we’re all good.”
“I’m pregnant,” Piper said, and it seemed to Phoebe she was speaking more to herself than anyone else.
Chris nodded. “It’s a boy,” he told her.
~
“She wanted me to help you get settled in, run errands for you and what not. Think of me as your personal servant. I mean, sure, child labour laws were put in place to specifically prevent this sort of treatment, but who really listens to those anyway? Am I right, guys?” The bitter tone was more for dramatic effect than anything. It was clear that the teen was excited about tailing the agents.
“Didn’t exactly volunteer for this job, huh?” An amused Gibbs questioned. Tony rolled his eyes.
“What was it that gave it away? I thought I had the whole ‘I love being here and was, in no way, forced to do this as a means of punishment for allegedly swiping reagents from Chem. Lab and accidentally singeing a girl’s eyebrows off because she was standing too close to the blast radius, even after I warned her’ act down to a tee.” 
~
“Tony…” The other agent drew out the two syllables in a way that clearly said I’m armed. ~
Pat chuckles. “Yeah, yeah. I know. ‘Thrill of the chase’. When are you just going to find a nice girl and settle down?”
“Wouldn’t wish me on a nice girl,” I reply lightly as I begin gathering my things. “But hey, if you can find me a naughty one…”
“Like you need my help finding those,” Pat groans as he rolls his eyes. ~ McGee has been stripped of his formal shirt and is wearing nothing but his white undershirt and pants. Someone has slicked his hair back with gel, and lent him some chains and rings. He is smoking a cigar, and by all accounts appears to be winning a game of Rummy. ~
“Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.” ~ “I don’t see what the big deal is - we just took a shower.” “Showers…we took separate showers.” ~ “Did you seriously just stamp your foot? I thought girls only did that on TV.” ~ “Well, that’s that plan scuppered. Obviously there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.” “Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic; we’ve got no chance.” ~
“Warrington’s aim’s so pathetic I’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me.” ~
“From now on, I don’t care if my tea leaves spell ‘die, Ron, die,’ I’m chucking them in the bin where they belong.” ~ “Harry, don’t go picking a row with Malfoy, don’t forget, he’s a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you...” “Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life.” ~
“Don’t be silly, Hermione. We need to confront the monster ourselves and risk getting hospitalized, just like we always do.” ~ “Don’t you guys know by now that banzai charges don’t work?” “All the soldiers who learned that were killed in banzai charges.” ~ Her voice sound calm, but she’s obviously putting some effort into keeping it that way. “I think I can deal with this level of pain.” ~ “Randy, what you’re looking at is a Nip anti-tank mine. It’s highly unstable with age, and contains enough high explosive to essentially decapitate everyone in our little group here from the ground up. So, if you could just stop being a complete asshole for a little bit, I’m sure we would all appreciate it very much.” ~
“- at the hands of a child to be born at the end of July.”
“… Lily’s not due till August.”
“August third, James.” 
~
Petunia cleared her throat. “He’s from that school,” she said, in a whisper that belonged on stage.
“I thought that was for girls with criminal tendencies?” said Vernon’s sister, a croissant in her mouth.
“What?” said Mrs. Evans, bewildered.
“No, not at all. What a horrible thought,” said Lily sombrely, galoshes safely on and her dad’s trench on her arm. “Enrolment certainly has no gender bias. It’s equal opportunity for anyone with a properly felonious bent.” The Dursleys looked very disapproving, and also very much as if they wanted to get back to the meal. Mr. Evans was trying desperately to hide his snorts in his napkin.
~
Lily really was never sure quite what to do with James, whether to slap him or walk away or kiss him, so she laughed and crossed her fingers that he’d manage to get up the nerve to try and kiss her again. She needn’t have worried, since he was, after all, a Gryffindor. But so was she. When he slipped in the cold mud dashing towards the slide, and went down flat, she went over laughing at him. Somehow, then, when he laughed too, a rich, vibrating sound that seemed to weigh down the air, and looked up through mud-smeared glasses (imperviousness, apparently, didn’t extend to mud), and gave her a “Give me a hand?” that really meant Let me pull you down with me, before her mind could quite catch-up to the flutter in the back of her throat, Lily Evans dropped to her knees and pressed her lips against James Potter’s so fiercely their teeth clinked.
~
“It’s looking a sight better since my James and Sirius took care of the weeds.”
“Did you?” said Lily, looking tickled.
“It was nothing, Mum,” said James. “We got to blow things up.”
~
“Nah. Last time I went out with Sirius, three waitresses got in a brawl over who’d serve our table and the cook had to break it up. It took ages for us to get our cheesy potatoes.”
~
“Oh was he?” Lily was much, much better at arching her eyebrow than Regulus could hope to be, James decided.
~
“Call me Edgar,” he said, reaching out his hand.
James didn’t take it. “How do I know you’re who I think you are?”
“Better,” said Edgar. “When you were fourteen, I questioned you, off-the-record, on suspected importation of the shards of a Chimera egg, which, like the eggs themselves, are a Class-A non-tradable good. And I’d still like to know what you wanted with those, James.”
“Unproven,” said James, breathing again and taking Bones’ hand. He shook it firmly. “Lily, this is Edgar Bones. Head of the Division for the Enforcement of Magical Contrabands.”
~
He eyed his friend apprehensively. “Well, last time you told me you had the Elder Wand off your dad, and that turned into a rubber mongoose when you let me wave it about.”
~
“Since I’ve never heard of a Tardis Hatchery, I’m going to have to guess that they’re gone, too. What’s the plural of Tardis? Tardises? Tardii?”
“Tardis. One sheep, many sheep, one deer, many deer, one Tardis, many Tardis. Well, seven Tardis. The plural’s in the ‘d’.” ~
“Does she ever stop smiling?” asks the Dancer, her mouth now full of sandwich. Everyone looks at Rose to see if she will stop, which she is unable to do. She is, however, able to hide her smiling face behind her hands.
“Not often,” says the Doctor. “I’ve only known her for a couple of hours, though. Maybe she gets more moody in the afternoon.”
~
“Harmless to us,” says the Visionary. “We can simply leave if they cause us trouble. But your planet is at a very delicate moment in its development: advanced enough to encounter alien life but primitive enough to panic about it. Just like the Doctor to set up a rendezvous in such a ticking time-bomb of a place.”
The Doctor shrugs. “The weather was nice.”
~
“You’d lie to your employers?” asks the Guide.
“Yes, happily.”
~ “If she is not . . .” she trails off and shrugs. “We’ll have to abduct her or brainwash her or something. I don’t know.”
Rose grins. “No one’s going to believe you’re proper aliens if you’re going to ‘brainwash me or something. You don’t know.’”
~
“You can read minds?” Rose asks. “Human minds? My Doctor never did that.”
“It’s difficult,” says the Student.
“And rude,” says the Guide. “Emergencies only.”
“And weird,” offers the Dancer. “Who’d want to read the mind of some other species? Yuck.”
~
“Rose?” The Doctor holds one open hand in front of her face. “How many fingers?”
Rose blinks a few times, suspecting this to be a trick question. “Are we counting the thumb as a finger?”
~
“They’re waiting for me,” the Doctor tells her. “Probably to give me another lecture on not compromising the dignity of the ancient and sovereign empire of the Time Lords.”
“Which you’ll ignore,” Rose guesses.
“Probably, yeah.”
~
“I spy, by and by, something…green.”
Without lifting his eyes from the map he was scrutinizing, Sam answered, “A tree.”
“Ah, but which one?” his brother asked from the driver’s seat.
~
“Piece of cake,” Dean told him, loading his shotgun.
Sam gave a cynical laugh. “When you’re sober.”
“Details, details,” he responded, and primed the weapon.
~
“According to Cat, it should be—”
“Cat?” Dean asked with one of those grins, then made a purring growl sound.
~
Dean’s eyes flew open in panic. “Where’s Sam?” he demanded, wincing at the renewed pain in his head.
“Can you move? Move your fingers for me, Dean.”
Right. Fingers. He had to think to do that. Thinking made his head hurt. Fingers. There. Satisfied? Where was Sam?
“Good. How many fingers am I holding up?”
Dean blinked, saw four, then two. Enough. He dragged his arm up onto his chest, cringing at the pain down his spine. “How many am I holding up?” he croaked. ~
Sam focused on his captor once more and glared. “Nothin’ personal, Sam,” Pete said with a shrug.
“Yeah, well, I’m taking it pretty personally,” Sam shot back, giving his arms a harsh tug for good measure.
~”
Dean froze. Pete smiled. A quick glance revealed a knife blade pressing against his ribs, and if there had been any doubt in Dean’s mind about Pete, it was gone now. Dean lowered his gun, his body slumping in resignation. He allowed Pete a moment of triumph before taking it away. Dean took him out in three moves. Flat on his back, Pete stared up at two guns pointed directly in his face.
“I’m gonna ask you one more time, and so help me—”
~
“Oh, man,” he groaned. “How many of these things are there?” This one was huge. Well, that explained the inconsistencies of the witness reports. There was a big difference between four feet tall and seven feet tall. Guess nobody figured there was more than one.
~
Glancing up, Dean saw his patient had lifted his head and was looking down at the bloody mess. Sam uttered a curse and let his head fall back onto the pillow.
“It always hurts more when you look, Sammy,” Dean admonished. Well, that’s what Dad had always said when they were growing up.
“No,” Sam shot back, his voice strained, “it hurt just as much before I looked. Now I just…feel sick.”
~
Sam barked a laugh that turned into a growl of pain. Then he told Dean exactly what he could do with himself.
“Nice. Where’d you pick up that language?” He grinned. “Oh, wait. Never mind.”
~
But the strange man only regarded her for a moment, and then said in a level voice, “Would you like to get that arm looked at, Ms. Kent?”
“Sure,” Kala replied, not moving an inch. “Open a door and I’ll make my own way to the nearest hospital.”
He chuckled at that. “Sorry, kid, I’ve got orders. I’m…”
Kala cut him off. “Are they anything like the orders given to the guys who brought me in? Because the next person who gropes me is gonna get kicked so hard they won’t even be able to scream in pain until tomorrow.” ~ She went to lunch with Demetrius Selwyn, partly because he asked nicely and partly because if she didn’t her mother wouldn’t let her hear the end of it. ~ She arranged her face into a picture of calm and continued, “I only meant to say that you can’t possibly relate to my upbringing. Kindly don’t put words in my mouth.”
His jaw dropped. “Kindly?” He repeated. “Who says kindly anymore? How old are you, ninety?” The edge had faded from his voice, replaced with a perturbed sort of amusement.
She glared. “Don’t make fun of me, Tonks.”
“Or you’ll what? Shake your cane at me?”
~
The travel documents were not as helpful and included an outdated railway timetable from Bombay and a steamer schedule from Perth. There was a very detailed map, the topography of which was certainly North Africa, but all in Arabic.
~
“Centaurs drink wine out of buckets!” Lucy giggled, though there was an edge to it.
“I think I’ve done that before,” Edmund commented, taking a mug from her and holding it for Peter. “Though I’m not sure I remember.”
“You have,” Peter said, pouring. “I remember it. Vividly. And do not recommend it.”
~
“It’s Peter,” he prompted.
“Right. Sorry. It’s just everyone called you High King.”
“That can raise eyebrows here, Eustace. I don’t recommend it.” He gestured to the cupboard. “Are you looking for something?”
~
“Were you always this wise and King Arthur-like and I just was too much a brute to see it?”
“Eustace?” Peter asked, instead of answering the unanswerable. “Just say, ‘I’m sorry, Peter,’ and we’ll be done with this, alright?”
~
“What do we have—” The doctor stopped cold at the sight, but recovered quickly. “Okay then. Let’s get ready to remove the, uh...”
“Bolt,” Dean growled softly. The doctor blinked and looked at him. “It’s a crossbow bolt,” Dean clarified. “Like an arrow? Only ‘bolt’ is the technical term for it.”
~
“The vampire. I was trying to shoot her with the crossbow and a bolt dipped in dead man’s blood, but she sort of . . . ducked.”
“You shot your brother?” A pause that was more than likely Bobby wiping a hand over his face and then a sigh. “Where?” Sam coughed and mumbled his answer. “Sorry, Sam, didn’t catch that.”
“In, uh, in the ass.” 
Another pause. “Were these midget vampires?”
~
“Are you forging my signature again, Boss?” Tony asked without heat. He squinted at the paper. “Are you forging Vance’s signature?”
“Yes,” Gibbs agreed. “And no.”
~
{Your muscles have become more toned. Reason: you are carrying more of the weight.}
Jaime sighed. “If you’re trying to get me to talk to you, it isn’t working.”
{False. You talked to me in order to answer. Conclusion: I have succeeded.}
~
“I didn’t know that you would come with your own armed guard.” “He won’t let me get a gun,” Brennan said bitterly, just as the door opened behind them.
~
“Yeah, that’s not creepy at all,” he observed under his breath.
~ “So you’re saying there’s a chance you could accidentally blow us up or something?” Dean asked, only half-joking. “Oh, no,” Luna said. “I don’t think the Lestranges would have anything that could kill someone outright.” “Awesome,” Dean said. “They’d probably want to torture any intruder first,” Luna added absently. “That’s far more likely.” ~ “Oh, it’s definitely her.” Jack frowned. “Him,” he corrected but that wasn’t quite right either. “It? Them? There’s got to be a special pronoun for this.”
~
“You picked a bad place to pitch the tent,” he said lightly, as they began to sink into the suddenly appearing green goop.
“Yeah, this planet,” she added. 
~
“Jaime, maybe you should relax.”
“Ohmigod, you’re not really Batman...Ohmigod, I said that aloud.”
~
“Hey, no, hey!” Chuck protested. “This is a big, big misunderstanding. And now it’s a misunderstanding with guns, and I can’t help thinking that is a lot worse than your basic everyday misunderstanding, so maybe we can all back off—”
~ “Put the gun down and step away from Chuck,” Sarah said from behind Sam, who raised his hands and tilted his head at Dean expectantly. Dean, in return, gave Sam a look that clearly asked why the hell he hadn’t noticed Sarah sneaking up behind him. Sam’s expression said that this was not the time to be an annoying sibling—that one, Chuck found pretty easy to read.
~
“Anyone ever tell you that your voice drops an octave when you get all commander-like?”
~ “Well, better pick that up. She never invites us to tea. It’s always ‘the world’s in danger! Come save us’ with that one,” Donna said, and marked her place in the book. She wouldn’t be getting any reading done.
~
“Plus, you know, time travel. She’s not such a fan of time travel. Because, well, everyone knows that shit never ends well, right? Seriously, who doesn’t know that? Fucking angels, that’s who.”

“Time,” it intoned, the booming sound glancing off the rocks, “will reveal all things.” “Enormously helpful, thank you,” Merlin muttered, and left the cave.

“Merlin and I thought you might need fuel,” Arthur explains. “And we were right.”  “So these are from Merlin?” Gwen asks quietly. “Do you really think I’d let him near an axe?” Arthur asks, his Merlin is blatantly a cretin expression on his face.
~
Arthur stared back, wondering vaguely what to do next. Merlin sank to his knees with a surprised look on his face, and then toppled over unconscious. Right, excellent plan. 
~
He was still half-blind with pain, dizzy with it, but he managed to croak out, “Damn you, get out of here.” So naturally Merlin came closer instead.
~
Merlin turned to him and said, “You will be king in Camelot, my lord,” in a voice full of thunder. Then he shook himself all over and stared at Arthur wide-eyed, still the complete idiot who fell over his own feet more often than not and couldn’t boil an egg to save his life. “Er,” Merlin said. 
“Right, no more prophecies,” Arthur said. “That’s just creepy.”
“Yeah, sorry,” Merlin said. 
~
“Want to go again? Double or nothing.”
“But I have no money. Oh wait, you always lose. Sure, why not.”
~ “It’s survivable. The drop is survivable.”
“Well, you can’t know that for sure unless—oh man, you just threw yourself out that window, didn’t you.”
~ “Shut up, you idiot,” Arthur says again because at this rate Merlin will make himself faint and Arthur is having enough trouble thinking of a way to escape without having to incorporate dragging Merlin’s unconscious body into the plans. “And for your information, it is rather difficult to leave when your feet are chained together. What do you want me to do, hop?” Merlin doesn’t say anything. Maybe he has finally managed to parse the meaning of “shut up”. Arthur won’t discount it as a possibility; after all, miracles have happened before.
~ Merlin blinks at him owlishly. “Well, yes. But what about you?” Arthur glares at him. 
“I was rather hoping you might do something about these, Merlin,” he says, lifting his wrists. “Look around for keys, or—” But Merlin is talking over him. “Oh, why didn’t you say so to begin with. I can just do this,” he says, and then Hisses something in a language Arthur mainly hears in nightmares, and his eyes glow gold and Arthur can feel the hair on the back of his neck stand up at the feel of magic in the air- As he flinches back, the shackles click open and fall to the ground. “Um. If that’s all right with you.” Merlin’s voice is far too soft and oh, right, Merlin is a sorcerer. Handy, that. “No, I’m going to yell at you and put you in the dungeons for having the temerity to rescue me instead of leaving me here to await ransom,” Arthur says sarcastically as he gets up. How he’s missed freedom of movement. “Of course it’s all right with me, idiot.”
~
Escaping winds up being much easier than Arthur had expected. First of all, the bandits decided to put up their prison tent directly at the edge of camp. Arthur finds himself honestly confused - incompetence is one thing, but how are these people even still alive? His estimation of their intelligence is not improved when he realises that the tent is also apparently entirely unguarded. There is a small fire burning nearby, which does imply that someone ought to be here, but still- Wait. Fire. Arthur smirks. After some time spent crawling through the underbrush (“Arthur, are you really sure this is the right way?” “Hush, Merlin.”), they hear shouts rising in the distance. Apparently the bandits have noticed that their supplies are on fire. ~
His manservant is still looking pale and shaky on his feet, and he’s still looking at Arthur in that odd way. Not the usual odd look, which Arthur has learned to interpret as “I will annoy my wonderful, kind, more patient than I deserve master and make his life difficult and refuse to treat him with the respect he deserves because I am mentally deficient and actually enjoy the stocks”. A different one. If he didn’t know better, he might suspect those thrice-be-damned bracelets had done permanent damage. Of course, he does know better, because it is entirely impossible for Merlin to— to— Something cold and tight twists in Arthur’s chest, and it takes him a moment to identify the feeling as fear. “Come on,” he says gruffly. “Let’s get back to Camelot.”
~ “Um,” said Merlin as if in answer to his thoughts. Arthur resists the urge to throw his hands in the air and shout “It speaks!” There’s still something oddly tentative about his manner, and Arthur will not risk Merlin deciding to shut up for another three hours because he will go stark, raving mad and probably start talking to trees for lack of better conversationalists. “Yes?” he says instead, trying to keep his voice gentle. “About the. The magic.” Telling himself Merlin isn’t a sorcerer would go so much better if he stopped saying things like this. “The magic. Yes, I must admit that was something of a surprise. After all, if you had asked me this morning what my plans for the day were, I would certainly have said ‘go hunting, get captured by bandits and find out Merlin is secretly a sorcerer who-” Arthur feels the sarcasm in his tone, sees Merlin flinch from the corner of his eye, and stops. Gentle. Right. Think of... of kittens. Frightened kittens you want to lure out of wherever they have got to. No, wait, that only reminds Arthur of the time when he was eleven and tried to save a cat from a tree at Morgana’s urging. He’d needed stitches. No cats, then. How about... maids. They’re such skittish things, and Arthur knows how to coax a shy, uncertain girl into his bed—Now he’s thinking of Merlin with breasts, which is entirely horrifying. “Say, do your eyes always do that?” Arthur blurts out, because he’s been curious - doing magic in Camelot is dangerous enough without having flashing lights giving it away - and because he has to get the image of female Merlin out of his head somehow. After all, he’s always known that Merlin was a girl but not litera— stopthinkingaboutit. “Whenever I’m doing magic, yeah,” Merlin says, looking uncomfortable. “Those things sort of - pulled my magic to the top. Odd way to make something detect magic, really. But really, what I wanted to talk about was—” “Well, it was also glowing,” Arthur points out helpfully before his mind catches up. “Wait, did you say the shackles only detected magic?” “Um, yes?” Merlin looks faintly alarmed. “So they didn’t block your magic at all?” “...no?” Now Merlin is looking confused. It is a very familiar expression. “So what you are saying is that while those bandits were running around dithering and staring at you as if you were my father, you could in fact have done magic at any time? You were only actually prevented from doing so once they’d slapped those bracelets on you?” Arthur demands, unable to believe that Merlin could have been that incredibly stupid. “Um. Well.” Arthur takes that as a yes, and completely forgets about being gentle. “You blistering idiot!” he shouts. “You could have got us out of there at any time!” “Look, I was only—” “Or tried to, or at least done something instead of sitting there like a gormless—” “Arthur, do we really have to—” “And what would have happened if we hadn’t been able to escape so easily?” Arthur yells. He thinks he’ll never quite forget that uncaring voice saying break him, and enough torture should make even a sorcerer compliant. If those bandits had been just a bit smarter, a bit more competent... “Arthur!” Merlin yells, his eyes flashing gold for a moment. A branch falls off a nearby tree with a loud crack and Arthur shuts up out of sheer surprise. “Could you possibly stop shouting at me for just a moment and tell me whether you’re going to have me executed or not?”
“Executed?” Arthur asks dumbly. His mind seems to be working far too slowly. “Yes! Executed! For doing magic, you know, that dreadfully illegal thing which your father tends to chop off people’s heads for!” Merlin is still shouting and that odd expression is back on his face. Finally, Arthur manages to identify it as fear. Directed at him. Merlin is afraid of him. “You honestly think I’d have you executed,” Arthur says slowly, pieces clicking into place. ~
“Thanks,” Merlin says, when he can manage it. He does not say, I was holding my own, but thanks for diving in with all your armour on to wrestle me away from a woman, you clod, because he’s growing as a person, and Lancelot doesn’t take affectionate sniping as well as Arthur does. 
~
This wasn’t meant to happen. He was meant to find the sword, carry it back to Camelot, and make a gift of it to Arthur with a lot of pomp and pageantry as befitting a bright, shiny offering from a sorcerer to a king. Instead, some meddling naiad has stolen it, and now the most pomp Merlin is going to get out of all this is the bit where he tells Arthur, “by the way, I threw your enchanted sword into a lake a few years back and now a girl has stolen it, good luck getting that back.” 
~
Arthur looks intrigued. “And you say there’s an enchanted sword in this lake?”  “I put it there,” Merlin says, wanting to stress how entirely-mostly-partially responsible he is for there being an enchanted sword in the first place. Arthur claps him on the shoulder. 
“Of course you did, Merlin. Who else would throw a perfectly good enchanted sword into a lake?”
~
“Yes, fine, there’s a lady in the lake and she has your sword.” Merlin gestures at the windows, in what may or may not be anything like the actual direction of the lake. “We should go and get it back.”  “Well, of course we’re going to get it back,” Arthur says, rolling his eyes in a manner that is not at all kingly. Lancelot coughs. Arthur gives him a boyishly excited grin. “Yes, you’re coming too.”  “Sire, she did try to drown Merlin,” Lancelot points out, which is nice; at least someone hasn’t forgotten that Merlin nearly died trying to retrieve the thing. Or, all right, he didn’t nearly die— but he did inhale an awful lot of lake water, and that can’t be healthy.  “So I’ll stay on the shore.” Arthur gives Lancelot a shove toward the door. “Lancelot, there’s a girl with an enchanted sword in a lake, did you really think I’d give it a miss?”  “I suppose not,” Lancelot says, beginning to pick up some of Arthur’s enthusiasm.  “I put it there,” Merlin says, for absolutely the last time.
~ The meddling naiad with the obnoxious smirk rises out of the lake sword-first. It is, Merlin has to admit, a rather impressive display: the sword gleaming, her dress clinging, the lake perfectly still.  “Fantastic,” Arthur says under his breath, beaming. “Merlin, from now on, I want to receive all new swords this way.”  Merlin smiles, any lingering irritation dissipating. “I’ll just toss them into lakes as I go, then, shall I?” The naiad makes a sound that is, Merlin suspects, the mythological lake creature equivalent of clearing her throat. Merlin does his best to look attentive, and very subtly elbows Arthur to make him stand a bit taller. Arthur elbows him back, and the naiad clears her throat again, more pointedly. Behind them, Lancelot gives a small, exasperated sigh.  “Arthur Pendragon, you may take up your sword,” the naiad says, and holds said sword out rather majestically, looking absurdly pleased with herself. Really? That’s all? Merlin had an entire speech prepared, and there was a bit at the end with magic and light and— take up your sword?  Arthur looks similarly nonplussed. “Well— all right, then, I’ll just—” He takes the sword from her and stands there with it held out awkwardly in front of him, clearly expecting there to be more to it than that. There isn’t. The naiad just slips back into the lake, with nary a speech nor an attempted drowning to further commemorate the event. “When I tell this story, I suspect it will be rather different,” Arthur says, staring at the still surface of the lake.  “More speeches,” Merlin agrees.  “Or not,” Arthur says.  Lancelot coughs. “That looks like an excellent sword, sire.”  “It’s not terrible.” Arthur turns the sword this way and that, giving Merlin a doubtful look. “It doesn’t feel enchanted.”  “I could make it glow, if that would make you happier,” Merlin mutters. Arthur purses his lips, actually seeming to consider it. “I’m not— no. I’m not actually making it glow, Arthur.”  “Of course not. That would be ridiculous.” Arthur slings an arm around Merlin’s shoulders, waving his shiny enchanted sword at the lake. Merlin wishes he wouldn’t; that’s just tempting fate, or naiads, or both. “Will it take that foul look off your face if I promise to work in one speech?”  Merlin gives him a sidelong look. “Is this speech going to be about me commissioning a magic sword for you and then putting it in the lake for years of safekeeping, or is it going to be about that half-naked naiad?”  “Can’t you just be happy with a speech?” Arthur tries. 
“I swear I’m going to take that sword back and give it to a king who isn’t such an incredible arse,” Merlin says.  Arthur rests a protective hand on the pommel of his sword. “It’s mine now, you can’t have it.”  “That’s what you think—”  “Yes, it is.” Arthur leans forward in the saddle, smiling down at Merlin with just the faintest twist of condescension. “Even that naiad wants me to have this sword, Merlin. Where are you going to hide it next, a cloud? A cave? Are you going to seal it in stone?”  Arthur is just being ridiculous to provoke Merlin, but knowing that doesn’t make it any less successful. “Don’t tempt me. I could.”  “In stone,” Arthur says again, doubtfully.  “I could,” Merlin insists.  “I’d just like to see you try,” Arthur says.[…]
“I liked it better with the naiad,” Arthur complains, after his fifth consecutive attempt to free his sword from the flagstones of the throne room.  “Apologise and I’ll let it go,” Merlin says, arms folded. ~
“I shall inform—” begins Arthur, but this time interrupts himself. “Are you cutting it off?”
“Some great prat seems to have mashed the buckle, so yes I am,” his servant informs him, and he does seem to be sawing at the leather strap with a knife. Then he looks up, and flashes a smile past Coveros, at Vedica. “That was you with the stasis spell, right? That was tremendously clever, I wish I could figure out how you did it.”
Vedica freezes, and a moment later, as he realizes who this servant must be, so does Coveros. Vedica stutters, after a moment, “It’s— it’s a slowing of certain, um, biological— for difficult pregnancies, you see, sometimes, to stop her from bearing early, it’s—” and he’s heard her explain this dozens of times already, so he knows she’s just clamped her mouth shut on “very useful in lambing time.”
“Brilliant!” the deadly sorcerer enthuses. “I wonder if you might be willing to—”
“Merlin!” interrupts the King. “I can handle it myself from here. Go interfere with someone else’s diplomatic process.”
“Don’t be an idiot,” disagrees Merlin. “You can’t even get your mail off without help since you broke that rib. Hold still.”
~
“You’re bleeding again,” he says, in a reproving tone, at some blood that Coveros can’t see.
“Yes, I do it to aggravate you,” says Arthur, in an annoyed tone he seems to reserve for servants, or sorcerers, or perhaps just Merlin. “Leave it, it’s— Ow! Stop that!”
~
The woman blinks at Merlin, her lips working over the words, and Arthur rolls his eyes. Idiot. She clearly doesn’t know much of the language; her English seems about on a level with Arthur’s Frankish, and there’s no way he could put that sentence into Frankish.
~
Startled, Arthur tries to readjust his footing, but that only makes more of the rocks move, skidding out and away from him, and an instant later he’s crashing through the greenery and rolling down the slope. (And thinking rather hysterically, as though he hasn’t just learned that his manservant is some kind of magic-wielding liar, that apparently Merlin’s selfless idiocy isn’t the only failing of his that’s spread to Arthur. Stupid clumsy (sorcerer) git.) His descent is neither quiet nor subtle, and when it’s over, Arthur finds himself on his arse, sword in hand, a few meters away from Merlin and the woman. Both of them are staring at him, stunned. (Even in the midst of everything that’s happening, Arthur takes a moment to appreciate exactly how hilarious Merlin looks with his eyes so wide. They could fall out of his head, like marbles, and wouldn’t those be some creepy marbles… )

She was wearing nothing but the $30,000 silk robe Lex had bought her in the Gaza district yesterday. The price was even more impressive when you considered it as dollars per square inch of fabric.
~
“How the hell did you get it to tune back in to this specific universe?” 
“I didn’t,” Lex said. “This is universe—” he looked down at his handheld—”four hundred thirty-seven thousand, six hundred seventy-two. I’ve already spoken to thirteen versions of us. And I have to tell you,” he added, dryly, “it’s putting a damper on my illusions of being a unique snowflake.”
~
“These two warlords from some place called Jowhar keep calling and screaming at the staff. What am I supposed to tell them? Where the hell is Jowhar?” 
“Somalia,” Lex said. “Don’t take their calls. They’re upset because you’re cutting off their ammunition supply. In a week they’ll have spent what they’ve got left against each other and Yalahow in Mogadishu will request LexCorp troop support so he can take them both down.”
“Who in where—wait, hang on a second,” Luther said, interrupting himself. “Let me get this straight, your brilliant plan is to stand by and just wait as they slaughter each other until they’ve used up the ammunition that you sold them?”
“You’re the last person I’d expect naïveté from,” Lex said. “If LexCorp hadn’t been selling them the ammunition cheap over the last few years, they’d each have a dozen different suppliers right now and there’d be no opportunity to cut them both off fast, at the same time.”
“They’re using high-calibre laser-stamped cartridges. Why don’t I just disintegrate them all with a high-frequency targeted subsonic pulse!” 
Lex paused. “That could work,” he allowed, grudgingly.

“I’m pretty sure you deserved that,” Superman said with a cheerful lack of sympathy, landing next to him.
~ “I got a badge that says case is mine. What’ve you got?” “Seven badges, and jurisdiction, douchebag,” Dean said. “This guy died by vampire.”
~
“I’ve got Bagels and sticky buns,” he announced aloud, rattling the paper bag. He looked up at the mezzanine, and caught Ianto glancing away quickly. Guilty. “Okay, spill it,” he said. “And you guys really need to work on your poker faces, by the way. They’re embarrassing.”
He watched as Ianto and Gwen gave each other a significant look. “I think, perhaps, you may need to see this in person,” Ianto said. “Oh, yes, definitely,” Gwen piped up, at a nudge from her partner in crime. “It’s very important that you get to see this...uh... face to face because, you know, you need to get a good feel for this particular problem.” “Very important,” Ianto echoed. “Right,” Jack said, as he looked over Ianto’s shoulder. He eyed Owen, who was suddenly studiously misting his plants. Tosh had resorted to hiding her face behind her monitor. “How about we start this conversation again…what the hell has happened?”
~
She took a breath. “I took readings, but they’re all over the place…and most of them are physically impossible. I mean, look at this one, it breaks at least two Einsteinian principles!” “Someone broke an Einsteinian principle? Around here?” Jack drawled. “Fancy that.”
~
“While I appreciate your assistance... Eliot,” says the lady. “I am not looking to make new friends.” That’s the most tactful and maybe also the clearest ‘Fuck off’ Eliot’s gotten in a long while (well, the clearest that wasn’t stated in those exact words, anyway). Hardison and Parker seem to think so too, judging by the resounding hoots and shrill giggles coming over the comm.

“Despite what you see in the movies, I can’t actually extrapolate a face from a blurry picture of the top of somebody’s head.” 
~
“Well hello there,” he said in a remarkably friendly way for a man who’d just clawed himself out of his grave. “Hello,” Merlin offered from somewhere behind Arthur. “Merlin!”
“What, I was only being polite?”
~ “So how did you get here? Are you lost?” Only Merlin would make conversation with a zombie. “He was buried,” Arthur pointed out. “Several feet underground, I would think if he wasn’t lost he was at the very least tragically misplaced.” ~
“Perhaps you’ve been enchanted in some way, by magic,” Arthur said suspiciously. “Magic?” Jack raised an amused eyebrow. “Well I suppose that depends on your definition of magic.” “Say no,” Merlin coughed. Arthur very carefully didn’t look at him. “No,” Jack said through a smile. “Definitely not magic, at all.” Then he paused and raised an eyebrow at Merlin, which seemed to get his attention. “But aren’t you supposed to be the greatest—” Merlin had a particularly involved coughing fit, over the end of the sentence, that Arthur suspected was entirely faked, though he couldn’t quite work out why. Jack put his hands on his hips and tipped his head to one side. “Ah,” he said meaningfully, like everything had suddenly become clear.
“Wonderful, we’ve unearthed a lunatic,” Arthur muttered under his breath. ~ “I’m not a zombie,” Jack said tartly, clearly annoyed at being ignored. Not a peasant then? “You were dead,” Arthur told him, which ended the matter as far as he was concerned. “The handy word in that sentence being ‘were,’” Jack said through a grin. Arthur gave him a look that he thought perfectly mingled disbelieving and imperious. Judging by the look he got in return he hadn’t quite managed it. “You got better?” Arthur said slowly. “From being dead?”
Jack grinned. “Yeah.” Arthur sighed. “It’s going to be one of those days isn’t it?” ~
For their vows, Ginny suggests—at least eighty percent facetiously—that they go with, “Well, I still don’t like anyone else better than you.”

“Ron, please. You’ve got connections there; you can call in a favour. Harry’s being all noble and ethical and uncooperative.” He snorted. “Odd, that. I wouldn’t have expected it of him.” 
~
“Lily for a girl, and James for a boy, of course, silly,” she said, smiling at him, and he’d looked up at her with an expression of such delighted surprise that she couldn’t help but kiss him, and he’d responded with equal enthusiasm, and for a while any thought of baby names was quite driven from both their minds.
~
“What made them think it was a good idea to try and steal from a top-secret highly classified very hush hush project?” 
“I told you,” Sheppard drawled, leaning back in his seat, “you can’t say it like that — it’s like waving a unicorn in front of some people.”
~
“Did they hurt you?” he asked. They all shook their heads in symphony. “Did they threaten any of you?” And before they could open their mouths, Gibbs added, “Beyond what was justified for guaranteeing your respective silence?” They shook their heads again. “Have any of you been touched in any way that will require me to report us all in for some sort of PTSD sexual harassment seminar?”
Tony gave him a serious look. “I think McKay was feeling me up for a little while there. I’ll soldier on, and really, I think it was only because he’s sublimated his totally crazy mancrush on Colonel Sheppard to a completely unhealthy—”
“Okay, in that case,” Gibbs snarled, and slapped each of them soundly on the back of the head, “we’ll never speak of this again.”
~
“Merlin!” he bellowed across the courtyard. Bedraggled, dirty, looking exhausted, Merlin looked up and grinned. Arthur marched over and punched him hard on the thigh. “Where the hell have you been?” Merlin looked down at him, a ridiculously sheepish expression on his face. “I didn’t think you’d notice?”
~
“Arthur. Arthur, this is a stupid idea.” Merlin sounded more panicked than Arthur thought any man who’d just been offered a benevolent magic sword had a right to.  “I think it’s brilliant,” he offered. “You’re magic. It’s magic. You’ll get along.”  “You can’t just give me Excalibur.” 
~ The Lady of the Lake eyed them speculatively. “You shouldn’t be here.”  “No,” Merlin agreed. “We shouldn’t. Sorry to bother you, won’t happen again.”  Arthur tightened his grip on Merlin’s shoulder. “My Lady,” he said, in the most reverential tone he could muster while restraining his chief advisor in a foot of freezing water, “I come before you as a protector of your lands, a humble servant of the Old Religion—” The Lady’s eyes narrowed. “What do you want?”  “A sword.”  “If you’ve lost Excalibur—”  “No!” Merlin yelped. “No problems there. Thanks for holding it and all that, we’ll be off now.”  “Merlin.” When they got back to the castle, Arthur planned to give Merlin a very, very long lecture about his attitude to foreign dignitaries. Especially ones who looked like they could kill with a glance. “We have come to ask, my Lady, for an additional sword. For Merlin.” The Lady raised an eyebrow.  “I don’t need a sword,” Merlin blurted.  “You can’t use a sword,” she pointed out.  “I thought he might be better with an enchanted one.”  The Lady snorted. “I don’t know of any that enchanted.” Merlin visibly relaxed. “Although—” Merlin visibly cringed. “—you could try a Vorpal blade. Very intelligent armourers, the Vorps. Managed to make a sword which did the fighting for you.” 
~ “We will never speak of this,” Arthur informed Merlin. 
“No,” Merlin told him, “because we are going to die.”
~ “I cut off its head.”  “You helped.”  “I slayed it,” Merlin sing-songed. “Slew it. It was slain by my hand. I’m a hero.” 
~ “Nnnngh,” said Merlin. “What do you want?” “Merlin,” said Arthur, in his best I could have you executed voice. Merlin groaned and lifted his head an inch or two from the pillow with great effort. “Sorry. What is it you need, sire?” ~
“It’s traditional,” Gwen explained, and Merlin didn’t have to ask if she meant the jugglers or the assassination attempt. He suspected it was true of both from what he’d seen of court life at Camelot.
~ Merlin is tempted to take the other chair, since Arthur seems determined to pace, but he’s afraid if he sits down he’ll fall asleep.
~ Arthur starts to pull his surcoat off, and then looks up at them. “Are either of you planning to go get some rest yourselves, or should I just ignore you while you permanently occupy my chair and you lurk in a corner?” “Just ignore us,” Gwen says, nodding. Merlin meets her eyes and then nods too, willing enough for her to take the lead for a while. “We’re not actually planning to leave, no.” Arthur looks very tired. “I — you don’t have to—” “Shut up,” Merlin says, and begins undressing Arthur with practiced hands. “I am your king, you know.”
“Shut up, sire.”
~ Something crept up Arthur’s spine, and he squared his shoulders against it. “Do you know what it means?” “Power, and not power.” Merlin blinked. “I mean, I think. Because I think maybe I heard it somewhere. But maybe I didn’t. I don’t really know.” “Truly, you are helpful beyond measure, Merlin.”
~
“Arthur?” asked Merlin hesitantly. “What’s wrong?” “Oh, you mean, apart from the fact that we’re stuck in a cage awaiting our deaths?” retorted Arthur. “What happened to all that ‘we die like men’ rhetoric?” asked Merlin.
~ “What’s going on, Arthur?” asked Merlin, a horrifying possibility only just occurring to him. “Why are they calling you a prince?” Arthur met his eyes, for a moment, and had to look away. “Because I am,” he said. “You couldn’t have told me that earlier?” Merlin hissed “I didn’t think it mattered,” said Arthur. “Does it?” Merlin glared. “Anything else I should know?” “You’re my manservant,” Arthur admitted.  Merlin frowned at him. “You’re a prat.” “I know,” agreed Arthur, sounding relieved. “And you’re a hopeless manservant.” “Just so we’re clear,” muttered Merlin, under his breath. 
~ Arthur peeked around the screen with a look of horror. “What does that—did I—did he—this doesn’t involve a wedding, does it?” Listening to Arthur verbally stumble over possible explanations for Bertram was entertaining, but Merlin wasn’t in the mood for twenty questions. “No, sire, you’ve not been married off to East Anglia, nor is Bertram part of your wife’s dowry. Neither did you deflower him, nor he you, and from now on when I say you’ve had enough wine, for God’s sake will you listen to me?” “Maybe,” came from behind the screen. “That still doesn’t explain—” “Jugglers. Flaming daggers being thrown at your head. Ringing any bells?” “Oh, he saved my life,” Arthur said, emerging from behind the screen, fully dressed if not fully alert.
~ “Arthur, has there ever been anyone who saved your life who wasn’t rewarded with becoming your manservant?” “Yes,” Arthur said triumphantly. “There was Patricia.” “Who, I’m guessing, was a woman, and therefore ineligible for the position?” “It wouldn’t have been entirely appropriate, would it?” Arthur leaned against the windowsill and met Merlin’s glare. Suddenly, he snapped his fingers. “Bryant. He saved my life and was never my servant.” Merlin latched onto the tiny bit of hope Arthur offered. “What was his reward?” “There’s a lovely bronze plaque in the servant quarters.” Merlin thought for a moment. He’d seen that plaque. There were quite a number of them, actually, now that he thought about it. Small and tasteful, inscribed with the words “For service offered to the House of Pendragon.” Followed by a name and a set of dates.  Merlin put a hand to his mouth. “I thought those were dates of service!” “They are.” Arthur looked mildly uncomfortable now. “He died saving your bloody life!” “And he’s got a lovely plaque to commemorate that.” “It’s a little wall of death, Arthur. An employee-of-the-month board for people who died trying to become your manservant.”
“I think they were trying to save my life.” ~
“For what reason?” Arthur asked, suspicious. “The pleasure of my lord’s company,” Merlin said without missing a beat, and immediately Arthur knew there was an ulterior motive at work.
~ “I can sneak up to the clearing and keep an eye on him until you return. He won’t even know I’m there. I’m very stealthy.” Merlin was glad Kay hadn’t been on the last hunting expedition where Arthur had gone into a long treatise on stealth and how Merlin utterly failed at anything resembling it.
~ Fortunately, his moment of involuntary hovering occurred while Arthur was bent over his breakfast, Merlin standing some way behind him and to his side. Unfortunately, Merlin’s fears that he might be seen in his incriminating, elevated position somewhat impaired his newly-developing smooth-landing ability. Arthur turned round at the thud of Merlin’s feet coming back into contact— hard and slightly painfully: he had dropped himself too fast—with the floor. “Merlin, are you jumping?” “No!” Merlin said. Then he realised the suitability of the explanation. “Yes!” ~
Zatanna narrowed her eyes at the gun. “I thought you said they didn’t give you one of those?”
Lois smirked. “They didn’t.”
~
“So…whatcha doin?” I ask lightly. Both brothers spin around startled. “Damn it Sam! You’re supposed to be the look out!” Dean snaps coming out of his crouch fluidly. He’s a good head shorter than his brother, I’ve got a few inches on Sam though. “Hi,” Sam says holding his hand out. “We were just interested I your shop but my brother here dropped his contact.” “He’s looking for a contact—with a lock picking set.” Deadpanning is a lost art.
~
“You’re looking good for your age,” The Doctor jokes. He hears a snort from beside him. “I like being a teenager. It gives me an excuse to be petulant.”
~ Arthur stared at the peaches with ten times the scepticism he had bestowed on yesterday’s strawberries. In a deeply dubious voice, Arthur said, “You found peaches.” Merlin beamed, nodding. Arthur looked from the peaches to Merlin. “You just... found some peaches.” Right, Merlin was actually going to have to tell him something; obviously last night’s idea that Arthur would be too distracted by the peaches to wonder where they’d come from had been overly optimistic. 
~
“Just peaches,” Arthur said flatly, “but peaches have stones. Peach stones go into a slop pail with the rest of the food scraps. Slop pails go to the pig boys, and the pig boys poke through the slop, to see if there’s anything the pigs shouldn’t eat, or anything they want to eat before the pigs get their chance. Pig boys’ mothers and sisters work in the castle kitchens, so when a pig boy comes to ask a cook or a kitchen girl what this is and whether it’s good to eat, then the whole castle’s going to know that there are peaches in Camelot, when everyone knows they don’t grow within our borders or anywhere near. And then someone gets accused of sorcery, again, and I have to cover for you, again, and if Gwen cries because of you even one more time I just might set you on fire myself. Merlin, that’s what comes of just peaches.” Merlin blinked. “You said—” “I know what I said,” Arthur snapped. “Obviously I’d put the fire out right away. But you must learn to be careful.”
~
“I am angry with you because you keep trying to throw your life away for no good reason and I happen to value it,” Arthur said firmly. “As your liege I require you to stop that immediately.”
~ “Very well, but I’m letting you do this under protest. I want you to know that.” “Duly noted. I’ll write it down, shall I? Arthur objects to me using magic to save his arse.” Merlin mimes writing on invisible paper.
~
Arthur taps his fingers against his manacles — it helps him think, and has the bonus of making Merlin grit his teeth in irritation. ~ Merlin bites his lip and hesitates. Never a good sign. “You’re not going to like it.” “Of course I’m not going to like it. It’s one of your ideas, and I never like them. But you’re going to tell me anyway, so get it over with.” “I can turn us into rats, and we can sneak out through the bars. If we stick to the shadows, no one will notice us.” Arthur nearly chokes in horror. “You are not turning me into a rat, Merlin.” “But—” “No. And that is an order.” “B—” “I mean it, Merlin. Don’t even think of doing it while I’ve got my back turned. I am not going to be a rat.” “Okay,” Merlin says quietly. Too quietly.  He watches Merlin carefully, just in case he’s planning to disobey a direct order. It wouldn’t be the first time, after all. Or the second, or the third. Arthur grins ruefully to himself. Merlin just sits and smiles at him, and eventually Arthur has to look away because it’s just weird watching Merlin smiling at him. By the time he hears Merlin muttering something that sounds like a spell, it’s too late to do anything. Arthur is jumpy for days afterwards. Literally. He’s not entirely sure Merlin changed him back properly, though Merlin insists he has, and Arthur can’t actually see any flea-like traits when he checks himself out in the mirror. It’s not like he can ask anyone else though — if Morgana ever heard of this, he’d have to kill himself. “It was totally uncalled for,” he tells Merlin, repeatedly, even though he knows he’s wasting his breath.
~
So, Arthur flutters around, his hand twitching constantly — Merlin knows it’s because he keeps reaching for his non-existent sword, but it actually just makes him look twitchy and nervous — and the party of knights from Hereford castle — the seat of Magonsaete — rescue them from a monster that’s actually nothing more than magical noises Merlin projects into the undergrowth. He adds a breeze to whip up the brambles, and it all looks pretty convincing. Merlin then simply looks abashed at having failed his princess, and Arthur manages to look coy (once Merlin’s nudged him twice and muttered to him to keep looking down and remember he’s a lady and don’t swear.)
~ “So, um, how much do you remember about what happened?” Merlin asks, and that immediately makes Arthur suspicious. “Why?” “Oh, no reason,” Merlin says breezily. Even more suspicious. “Tell me exactly what happened,” Arthur orders. “And remember, I can always tell when you’re lying. You’re a shitty liar.” Merlin looks mildly offended. And also mildly constipated, but Arthur’s pretty sure that’s just his thinking expression. “Well,” he starts. “I can tell when you’re planning to lie, too,” Arthur points out helpfully. Merlin mutters something under his breath. Arthur thinks it’s probably a good thing he doesn’t catch it. 
~ “I’ve got a plan,” Merlin says, and Arthur groans. “Oy, there’s no need to be like that,” Merlin says, as though Arthur doesn’t have the perfect right to groan at the thought of Merlin having a plan. Bad things happen when Merlin has plans or ideas. Or actually, when Merlin is anywhere around. Arthur waits for Merlin to carry on and tell him the plan, but he doesn’t. He doesn’t say anything, just hangs his head a fraction and looks disappointed. Which is probably a ploy to make Arthur ask — in fact, Arthur’s sure it is, and he wouldn’t give in and ask, except—he can’t help himself. 
“What’s the plan?” he asks, as wearily and uninterested as he can manage. Merlin comes straight back to life. “I can’t tell you,” he says, “but I guarantee you’ll like it.” ~
“The king sent me to get you,” Merlin said, with a tone that implied strongly that he wasn’t rolling his eyes where Arthur could see, but just wait until his back was turned.
~ Arthur turned to look at the elves, who were arguing furiously in voices that sounded like something between music and the clashing of swords, until their quarrelling was interrupted by a heavy bang.
~
“I’m not going to get you stuck in this!” Merlin said, and then waved an utterly insulting hand at the other warriors. “Look at them!” 
Arthur glared at him, almost speechless with indignation. “And what are you going to do on your own, bleed on them? Shut up and name me your champion, and that’s an order.” 
~
“Is Morgana watching?” Arthur muttered, pulling his shirt off. 
“—no?” Merlin said. 
“You’re lying, aren’t you,” Arthur said. 
“Yeah,” Merlin said apologetically. “Sorry. Everyone’s watching, actually. Even the elves.” 
~ All the court of Camelot was cheering wildly, women waving kerchiefs at him, and Arthur raised a hand to them before he stepped off the field. Even his father was smiling, that broad, satisfied look he almost never got. Merlin, on the other hand, was just standing there at the side of the ring looking deeply relieved, as if he was astonished Arthur had managed to avoid getting himself killed. “Don’t look impressed or anything, just because I defeated a terrible magic-wielding elven warrior,” Arthur snapped. ~
“That’s not what you said before!” Arthur said. “So I could’ve just taken my sword—” 
“Your mortal-forged blade would not be able to enter the ring,” Eldren said contemptuously. 
Merlin dragged himself straight and said, golden eyed, “Try this one, then,” and grabbed Arthur’s hand. He took it and plunged it into the wash-water basin Gwen was holding, the water still pink with blood. 
“What are you doing—” Arthur said, but Merlin was shoving his hand deeper—deeper than the basin was, and Arthur’s hand was brushing something cold and hard. He put his hand around the hilt, and slowly drew the sword out, water spilling from the cross-brace and running down the blade like rain. Gwen stared wide-eyed at it, and down into the basin, which was looking just like a basin again. 
“There,” Merlin said, smugly, and fell over. Arthur barely managed to catch him with one arm, the sword in his other hand. Merlin clung to his shoulders and smiled up at him, dazed and stupidly happy-looking, and Arthur’s mouth went dry as parchment. 
“It’s wet!” he made himself say, because otherwise—otherwise— 
Merlin frowned at him. “It’s been in a lake! Stop complaining.” He pushed on Arthur’s chest, which didn’t do much good as he was still only being held up by Arthur’s arm. “Now go win.” 
~
Arthur took another deep breath and lifted Excalibur chest-high, put the point at Dianys’s throat and said, “Do you yield?” 
Dianys inclined his head, graceful as a dancer even in the armour. “I do.” 
“Oh, thank god,” Arthur muttered, letting the sword sink, and then he offered Dianys his arm. 
~
“You know, Merlin, I’d be happy to reassure you that I can beat you unmercifully any time I like,” Arthur said warningly, because that was quite enough in the way of interruption. 
~
“I’m going to be put to death the instant we leave this room, aren’t I,” Merlin said, in calm terror.
~ Did the woman have no discretion at all? The answer was evidently no. “As you have no House of your own,” she went blithely on to Merlin, not even bothering to keep her voice low, “I thought perhaps I would mention that the House of Tienla would welcome you, if you have made no arrangements for this night before your final challenge. It is often said that an exercise of virile energies pleases the gods of the grove.” 
As he understood what she was saying, a wave of sudden rage made Arthur’s hands clench. “Are you propositioning Merlin?” he snarled. 
She blinked at him with her rose-pink and sapphire eyes, puzzled, and then her face cleared. “Oh, no, no,” she said, and before he could draw a breath she explained, “Of course we invite you both.” She then turned and waved a hand towards her table. There were perhaps two dozen elves assembled around it, men and women, all watching with active interest. Some of them raised their goblets. A brief uncontrolled sound escaped Uther, for just a moment, and there was a creak where his hand gripped the arm of his throne. Arthur very carefully didn’t look, even as he heard Morgana choking quietly on her wine on Uther’s other side. 
“Thanks but—” Merlin said a little squeakily, “but—” He stopped. 
“He’s going to be holding vigil,” Arthur said, through his teeth. “Privately.”
~
“It’s a bloody cup made out of wood!” Arthur hissed. “How was I to know it was some mystical elf artefact? Maybe it isn’t,” he added, looking at the cup, which was standing on a table that had been placed before the elven throne, along with the orb and the circlet. It looked ridiculously incongruous next to the rich-hued embroidery of the tablecloth, the jewelled treasures, and the glittering throne. “Maybe it just happens to look like—” 
“The magical grail they lost a thousand years ago,” Morgana said, sarcastically. 
~
“Isn’t it about time she was married to some lord extremely far away from here?” Arthur demanded of his father, as Uther joined them at the high table. “One who’ll beat her,” he added darkly, glaring at Morgana. 
“That is enough, both of you,” Uther said. “Try not to be absurd beyond reason. Even if the elves were lunatic enough to ask it, Arthur is not going to marry the boy.” 
He said this with particular emphasis, glaring at Eldren, who had approached the high table. Eldren raised his slanted eyebrows and said, “Lord Emrys and the prince are already wed: those who enter and leave a seven-wood grove hands-clasped are bound for all their days.” 
~
“Actually, I have a plan for that,” Merlin said. 
Arthur raised his eyebrows. “You do.”
Merlin looked a bit embarrassed. “It might possibly be—Morgana’s plan.” 
“Oh God,” Arthur said. 
“But I think it’s a good idea!” Merlin said. 
“So who are we conquering?” Arthur said, feeling rather fatalistic about it. 
“I’d like to think of it more as—making peace?” Merlin said. 
“Right,” Arthur said. “And who are we going to be making peace with?” 
“Er,” Merlin said. “Everyone, really. It’s just,” he hastily ran on, “she made the excellent point that if you leave anyone out, it’s just asking for more wars to go on, and—” 
~ Dumas looked at him with confusion. “Actually, we just meant to kidnap Prince Arthur. I’ve got no idea what you’re doing here.” ~ He fastens Arthur’s belt and straightens his collar. “There. You don’t look like a disgrace.” “I’m not taking your word for that,” Arthur says, and Merlin turns to hunt for his mirror.
“Maybe someday you’ll learn to straighten a collar,” Arthur says, tugging at it in a way that makes no visible difference. ~ Best to play it on the safe side. “Thank you, Arthur,” he said, looking everywhere but into Arthur’s eyes. “It’s a very nice... stick. I can’t wait to write to my mother about it.” Arthur let out a huff of breath and stared at the ceiling, a pained and suffering look on his face.  “I mean it! It’s the finest stick I’ve ever owned!” Merlin cast about desperately for something appropriately grateful and servile to say; finding nothing, he slouched out of attention and grinned. “For such a lowly servant as myself, to be graced with any gift from the Crown Prince of Camelot is truly an honour. Henceforth I will celebrate the anniversary of Stick Day rather than my birthing day.” “I honestly don’t understand why lightning doesn’t strike you dead where you stand when you prattle on like that.” “It’s been said I live a charmed existence.” “Aren’t you even going to try it out?” “Really, Arthur, what am I supposed to do with it? I suppose I could try to beat you to death with it, but assuming you didn’t kill me yourself I’d be executed for treason.” “It’s not a stick,” Arthur said, in the kind of low, calm voice he typically used on enemy soldiers he was preparing to eviscerate. “It’s a staff.” “So it is for beatings.” Merlin’s eyebrows shot up. “This isn’t like the time you made me sharpen your practice swords before having at me with them, is it? Because I’m not going to polish this thing on a daily basis just to have you smack me about with it. Enough is enough.” “Merlin.” The word seemed to be ground out from deep in Arthur’s chest. “It’s for you. It’s for you to use. It’s not for beating people. It’s for—” and here he made an odd and squiggly gesture with his fingers “—you know.”
~
If Arthur wanted to believe him exhausted, he could go ahead: it would be perfectly true in not very long, when the power he’d broken from the sky stopped humming in his veins and resenting the way he stood still. ~ Arthur pulled the top blanket out from under Merlin, turning him over onto his back in the process, and dumped it on top of him. However, Merlin wondered, staring idly at the ceiling, which seemed to have stars on it, whether dumped was really the right word. Dumped didn’t cover the part where Arthur tugged the blanket down over Merlin’s feet.  ~ “You actually know what you’re doing,” Merlin noted, mild surprise in his voice.
~ “And if it wasn’t poison, why do I feel like shit?” Arthur said, glaring and Merlin shrugged. “It was a sleeping draught. Anhora said it would take a while to wear off completely and that you could use the time to consider what you have learned from the tests,” he quoted and Arthur’s mouth settled into an irritated line. “Bugger that,” he said, sitting up. He got almost upright but his face turned green and he sank back down again and Merlin put a prudent hand on his chest just in case Arthur got any more bright ideas. “Did you miss the part where I said it took a while to wear off?” “Shut up, Merlin,” Arthur said. It looked like Arthur had gone back to being difficult instead of noble and sombre now that he knew he would live. Though sometimes Arthur was difficult and noble both at once, like when he drank supposed poison instead of letting Merlin do it or when he managed to look the happiest Merlin had ever seen him while believing he was dying. Merlin wasn’t sure he was ever going to understand Arthur. He had time to try though, and that took the annoyance away. It didn’t even come back when Arthur kept shifting his head about on Merlin’s leg and shooting him glares like it was Merlin’s fault he’d only brought himself and his legs on the quest and not thought to bring a feather pillow. “You are way too skinny for this to be comfortable,” Arthur finally muttered. “I could put you on the nice cold, hard rocks if you’d rather,” Merlin retorted. 
~
“Yes, I can see your attention is undivided,” Arthur agreed, nodding toward the hearth where the rug was merrily ablaze along with the tinder. “Oh!” Merlin exclaimed, hastily stomping it out.  He bent close to examine the damage.  “You can hardly tell.  Well, mostly.  It’s a bit noticeable, here where the crest is.  Was.  Ehm.”
“Your attempts to kill me are becoming more blatant,” Arthur remarked mildly. 
~
Arthur, who spent his childhood hunting in these trees, loses his way. Merlin has never been able to navigate here, save when he was chasing Arthur down. “Well,” Arthur mutters, “this is a slight setback.” “How exactly did we manage to lose an entire army?”
“Well, I believe, and correct me if I’m wrong, it happened when you said, ‘Sire, I’d really like to get home tonight’. Instead of staying in the village until light, with the rest of the army.”
~
“Satisfied?” asks Arthur when the job is done. His favours Merlin with a haughty glance, indicating that he’d bloody well better be satisfied.
“Do you practice that look in the mirror?” flashes Merlin, too concerned to be tactful. ~
“That’s her. Wands down.” 
They obeyed. It was a mark of how much things had changed in the last year that Harry didn’t find it at all odd to issue commands and have them obeyed with admirable precision. Not even Hermione looked the slightest bit contrite at having raised her wand to a professor.
“Sorry, Professor,” Harry said, more as a courtesy than a real apology.
“I would have been quite surprised if you’d reacted any other way,” she told him. She pointed her wand at Harry in turn. “Tell me, Harry, where do Vanished objects go?”
“How’s he supposed to know that?” Ron muttered; meanwhile, Hermione’s eyes were bouncing back and forth between Harry and McGonagall in a way that Harry would have found insulting if it hadn’t been justified. 
“Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything,” he told her, with a mockingly superior glance at a surprised Hermione, who now appeared to be thinking that perhaps that answer had proved that he was not Harry Potter.
~
“Any thoughts on the award ceremony?”
“Not having one?” asked Harry hopefully. Ron looked slightly put-out.
~
“So you’re still alive, then,” said Uncle Vernon when he saw Harry.
“Sorry to disappoint you,” Harry said, feeling strangely comforted that some things, like Uncle Vernon’s enormous hatred of him, never changed. Perhaps he would go round the Dursleys’ home once a year for the rest of his life, just to remind himself that nothing was as bad as living with them and to get himself a bit of grounding abuse.
~
“You’re not as stupid as you look,” said Bill in a brotherly way.
“Thanks. Tell that to Hermione.”
“Ron’s not as stupid as he looks,” Bill repeated obediently.
~
To Harry’s immense relief, it took Ron and Hermione only a few days to remember how to speak to each other without blushing, stammering, or otherwise triggering his desire to flee. Just after their Order of Merlin ceremony (which Harry spent under his invisibility cloak so as to guarantee that the crowd’s attention remained where it belonged), they informed him that they now considered themselves boyfriend and girlfriend. Harry refrained, with some effort, from making a reply along the lines of “no fucking kidding,” and suddenly their three-way dynamic was as good as it had ever been.
~ “Yes, Guinevere and Morgana told me everything – they found the letter Gaius left for you.” “They did!” Merlin said, sitting back, eyes widening slightly. “Yes, they did,” Arthur replied, dipping a hunk of bread in his stew and ripping a piece off. “I was angry at first, of course,” he said around his mouthful, “Magic is incredibly dangerous, Merlin, you shouldn’t have got mixed up with it. If my father ever found out, for one-” Merlin opened his mouth, “not that he will,” Arthur emphasised, and Merlin closed his mouth again.  “You’re taking this very well,” Merlin said weakly, after a moment. “It was your mother’s life,” Arthur said dismissively, waving his bread, “of course you had to do something.” “Right.”
“I just think that throwing yourself down as a sacrificial lamb to the first sorceress you could find was not the only course of action. She would have obliterated you without a second thought, you know. How did both of you manage to get away, anyway?” Merlin stared at him in what looked to Arthur like confusion, though sometimes with Merlin it was hard to tell, then something seemed to click and he said, very quietly, “Oh.” He paused, staring at Arthur oddly, then swallowed audibly and said, “We got lucky. She—she dropped her guard and, uh, Gaius managed to distract her long enough for me to, you know, with a sword.” He stopped, staring down at his hands resting uncharacteristically still on the tabletop. Thinking he understood, Arthur half stood and reached over to clap Merlin on the shoulder. “Don’t worry,” he said, “She would have killed you if she’d had the chance.” “Yeah, she certainly tried,” Merlin said, with a bitter little laugh, and just for a moment, a mere fraction of a second, Arthur had a flicker of doubt, a sharp point of a feeling, prodding at his insides, that they were in fact not talking about the same thing. 
~ “Oh, you know, just... was I alright, how was the journey, she was glad I was alive, that kind of thing.” “Hm,” Arthur meant to say, except it came out more like hmpf. “The kinds of things a normal person asks when their friend returns from a perilous journey,” Merlin added pointedly, but he was grinning, and Arthur couldn’t help returning it.
~ Apparently Merlin had had a similar lapse of memory because the next thing Percy heard was not the low tones of the Perfect Manservant but the rather less refined replying bellow of  “What?” echoing across the courtyard. There was a pause, during which Percy didn’t need to be watching to know that Prince Arthur was giving his manservant A Look. Nor did he need to be watching to suspect that Merlin was (probably) pulling a face. 
“Er.. I mean… yes Sire?”  
There were footsteps then and the sound of the Prince’s drawling voice and Merlin’s, now quieter, replies. Percy winced. He wondered if Merlin was bowing again. He hoped not. Percy thought he had never seen anything as unnerving as Merlin bowing. When he had witnessed the alarming spectacle at first hand, earlier that morning, Percy had wondered, for just a second, if the Prince had not found it a little unnerving too. But then Prince Arthur probably didn’t feel as guilty about the whole situation as Percy did. When the Prince had strode up to him the week before, looking at his most commanding and blithely unaware that Merlin was a few paces behind grinning and giving Percy the thumbs up (which somewhat ruined the whole effect).
~
“My service is my life Sir Percival.” He intoned earnestly. Percy blinked. ”As a humble commoner it is all I have to offer my liege lord as proof of my unfailing loyalty and devotion to his wellbeing.” There was a long moment in which Percy just stared at Merlin. Then Merlin grinned and Percy realised that it was Merlin after all. 
“That was…a little creepy.” Percy thought he should learn to engage his brain before he opened his mouth but Merlin looked thrilled.
“Do you think so? I tried it on Gaius last night and he just asked me if I was sickening for something and made me drink one of his disgusting ‘remedies’”
~
“For pity’s sake Merlin will you stop following me around.”
“But you told me to! You said I should attend you immediately once I’d finished cleaning your chambers and mucked out your horses and collected your boots and…” The Prince stopped at this and Merlin walked into the back of him again – possibly taking the total into double figures. Percy thought the Prince might be gritting his teeth.   
“I didn’t tell you to trail around after me like a bloody lost puppy.”
“But Sire…” Percy wondered briefly how Merlin managed to make those two small words sound so wounded, “I’m supposed to stay behind you. I asked the Castle Steward and he said it’s royal protocol.” Prince Arthur looked as though he had a few things to say to that but by now several passers-by were staring openly and Merlin was managing to make wounded innocence into an art form so he settled for grabbing Merlin by the arm and dragging him along.
“Well since you so clearly have nothing better to do, I suggest you go and see to my armour. Again!” the Prince finished triumphantly. But apparently even this could not faze a Perfect Manservant.   
“Sire, if my work has been unsatisfactory in any way…” Merlin looked completely devastated at the thought. One or two onlookers were now casting reproachful glances at the Prince who looked a little taken aback at Merlin’s tone.
“Of course it… I mean I didn’t…” he stopped suddenly and glared at his manservant, who was staring at him with huge, sad eyes. “Oh shut up Merlin.” He gave him an irritated shove in the direction of the armoury, ignoring his small audience who were now looking scandalised at the Prince’s rather callous treatment of his servant. Percy suspected they might have been even more scandalised if they could see the grin Merlin cast at his master before he gave an elaborate bow and disappeared through the doorway to the armoury, passing a surprised looking Sir Rowan (who got a bow as well just for good measure).
“What on earth’s wrong with Merlin?” Sir Rowan asked in apparent bewilderment.
“There is nothing whatsoever wrong with Merlin,” the Prince said crossly, still glowering at the armoury door. Unfortunately Sir Rowan didn’t seem to notice his less than encouraging tone.
“But I’ve never seen him…” It was at this point that Sir Rowan caught the Prince’s eye and seemed to think better of whatever he had been about to say. “er…here…before.” He finished a little feebly. The Prince was looking at Sir Rowan suspiciously and Percy was wondering if he was about to point out that Merlin was in fact there most days
~
Unable to put off the moment any longer Percy looked at Brutus. Brutus stared balefully back at him, as if unable to believe his owner had dragged him from his warm comfortable stable to stand in a muddy field. He risked another glance at his father and his heart sank. Lord Weldon was glaring down at them as though already mentally drafting Brutus’s Bill of Sale.
“He’ll get rid of you, you know,” Percy told his horse. Brutus shook his head and sneezed. “There’s no use you shaking your head at me, he will! And your new owner will keep you outside all the time - and don’t think he’ll bring you carrots because he won’t.” Brutus snorted. “In fact I bet he’ll keep you for pulling his cart and only feed you rotten apples and damp hay.” 
It was at this point Percy realised Sir Merit was looking at him as though he were mentally unstable.
~ In reality of course Percy had had to endure several lengthy anecdotes about his father’s own Glorious Jousting Career (during which time Brutus had tried to wander off twice and both times Percy had dragged him back because really, if he had to listen to this then so did his horse) and now he was standing in the great hall, fidgeting in his court robes and trying to prevent his father talking to anyone who was not deaf or able to trace their family back at least eight generations. ~
“I do long to be helpful to you Sire.” piped up Merlin with the air of one whose entire life was devoted to such noble aims. 
 Suspecting that Prince Arthur was on the verge of committing the unpardonable social crime of murdering his manservant at a royal function Percy decided to intervene, casting around desperately for a suitable diversion. ”Oh look – I think the food is arriving at last.” which, as diversions went, he knew was a little feeble but it was still infinitely better than commenting on the floral arrangements in the hall (which had been Plan B).
~ “It’s been tolerable I suppose. Our rooms are shockingly drafty. Shockingly drafty!” the earl declared. 
Prince Arthur looked rather taken aback at this forthright opinion.
~
“Oh very well.” He turned hastily to the Page. “Have the kitchens send up some of the meat as well—”
“—and some of the pastries,” put in Merlin.
“—and some of the pas…” the Prince stopped suddenly and glared at his manservant who immediately hung his head.
“I’ll await your judgement upstairs then Sire,” Merlin said meekly. 
~
“What?” Merlin asked through a mouthful of food. The Prince, who had got the full benefit of this, looked faintly revolted.
“I realize silence is a strange and unnatural state for you Merlin but I would have thought even you could manage to make less noise when you’re eating and not more”
“I…” announced Merlin as he reached for another slice of bread, “am very hungry” The Prince’s only response to this was a snort. Merlin looked indignant. “I am! Look at me, I’m shrivelled up with hunger” He gestured expansively towards himself with one hand while continuing to pile cheese on his bread with the other.
~
“Percy,” Prince Arthur replied, in the condescending tone of one who often finds himself having to explain the most obvious of points to his subordinates. “Your father is a guest here at Court. As such it would have been extremely rude of me to challenge his opinions in front of his fellow nobles. As Crown Prince and one of the hosts of this tournament I must set an example and put my private feelings aside in the interests of…”
“He was scared of your father,” put in Merlin helpfully.
“Yes thank you Merlin— I would hardly expect you to grasp the finer points of diplomacy and etiquette.”  The Prince scowled at his manservant, who merely grinned back unrepentantly and helped himself to a chicken leg as his master continued. ”Did you get any use whatsoever out of that book I gave you?”  
“Yes” replied Merlin indistinctly, his mouth full. The Prince raised his eyebrows in apparent disbelief.
“And that would be what exactly?” Percy winced at the sarcasm in his voice. Merlin finished chewing and gave an enormous swallow before he replied.
“Gaius’s worktable had a wonky leg.”
~
“So, does your father always…er...”
“Finish people’s sentences?” Percy said without thinking. There was a sudden snort from Merlin. Percy clapped a hand over his mouth in horror, wondering if this meant he was actually going to turn into his father and deciding simultaneously that he was never ever going to tell Isolda about this. “I’m afraid so Sire.” He added, sighing. “My nurse once told me he even did it at his own wedding” He paused reflectively for a moment, “She said no-one ever knew if he married my mother, himself, or old Father Eldridge the priest.”   
~
“Oh, you took today off specially? I’m deeply touched.” “I don’t wanna know about your sex life.” ~
“You making a move on my bird?” Ron asked, raising an eyebrow. “You want me to tell her you call her ‘your bird’?” Harry asked and Ron snorted.
~ “Ron isn’t allowed to be debauched,” Harry said. “Hermione’s orders.” “I’m glad you’re here, actually, Harry,” Neville said, ignoring Ron’s protest of autonomy.  “I know, I know,” Harry said. “No one has seen me for months.” ~
“I’m not exactly renowned for my romantic words,” Ron said. “But even I can tell that’s not gonna work.” “It has a certain charm,” Neville said encouragingly.
~
“Will isn’t big enough for you.” Someone thumped the door urgently. “Good enough,” Harry amended. “Will isn’t good enough for you.” Ginny frowned. “And you think my love life is your business, do you?” she asked. Harry opened his mouth and looked confused. “Yes, I do,” he said. “I beg your pardon?” “No,” he said. “I thought you were gonna say ‘and you think you’re good enough, do you?’” She gaped at him. “You can’t do this,” Ginny said finally. “He doesn’t love you like I… might,” Harry said lamely, having held out against Ron’s preferred ‘do’. “Might?” Ginny echoed. There was a groaning noise in the hallway.
~
She raised a cynical eyebrow. “What was that load of crap?” she demanded. “Ron rewrote my speech,” he muttered. “He thought it wasn’t romantic enough.” She snorted. “And that was romantic?” “I had to edit some out as I went along,” he admitted. “Stuff about your breasts that I couldn’t say in front of your mum.”

But where words failed, Arthur could always rely on illustrations— illustrations which mainly involved a victorious stick figure Arthur and, in case his guardian had missed the point, he added a stick figure Tom and Owen on the floor at his feet surrounded by rather a lot of red pen. To one, particularly vivid letter, his guardian replied with a book entitled ‘Emergency First Aid’, several rolls of bandages and a photocopied page from the School Handbook with several large arrows pointing to the section headed ‘Violence against fellow students will not be tolerated.’ Perhaps he had gone a little overboard on the red pen.  
~
Prince Arthur came to a stop beside their table. His eyes took in Percy, the half empty jug of ale, the rather wet table and his dishevelled manservant who had now slumped back down onto the bench and was smiling angelically at a Prince whose eyebrows looked in danger of disappearing into his hair. ”Did you just summon me?” 
If anything Merlin looked even more angelic. ”Might’ve.” 
“You do realise, Merlin, that servants do not summon their masters? I seem to remember us having a similar conversation after you shouted to me from the third floor window on market day.”
“You forgot your gloves.”
“I doubt the whole of Camelot needed to be apprised of that fact, and certainly not by you shouting like a fishwife from the West Tower.” 
Merlin actually rolled his eyes at this point, Percy wondered if he was about to be thrown into the stocks. ”Just sit down will you, I want to talk to you.” Merlin waved vaguely at the table and Arthur, to Percy’s astonishment, sighed in a long suffering kind of way and slid onto the bench beside Merlin, grimacing at the now sodden surface.
~
“Percy was telling me about mead—weren’t you? His sister set fire to a barn.” The Prince looked rather taken aback at this unexpected revelation. When Merlin failed to elaborate he turned to Percy, who felt compelled to wade in before his sister was forever labelled a drunken pyromaniac. 
~
“So…” said Percy, looking at Merlin “What are the chances of us getting out of this in a heroic fashion?” Brutus sneezed and sank another inch. Merlin and Percy stared at him for a second and then looked at each other. 
“Probably not good,” said Merlin. He wriggled a little, experimentally, and succeeded in moving slightly closer to the bank, “But I don’t think the others will be here for a while yet, “ He moved fractionally again, “so perhaps if I go really slowly I can get out and then we can salvage some…” He suddenly flailed wildly and nearly fell over again before grabbing hold of a surprised looking Brutus and hanging on grimly. “Or perhaps not.” Percy looked at the thick gloop now around his knees and wondered how the King would make ‘death by bog’ sound honourable to his father. 
~
“Shall I throw some mud at him?” Merlin muttered, leaning in his direction as much as he was able, ”I’m reasonably certain Arthur won’t let him kill me after.”  Percy bit his lip, managing to suppress the smile that threatened. He noticed Prince Arthur was giving his manservant a look that suggested he was either excellent at lip-reading, or knew Merlin far too well.
~
“This, Merlin, is the Royal Envoy of Deheubarth. But then, apparently you already know that—” 
“Everybody already knows that.” 
Arthur glared at the interruption. “—apparently you already know that because you have been making plans, without even consulting me, your King, to sneak off to God knows where—”
“Deheubarth,” put in Merlin helpfully.
“—to God knows where to use your magic to help a rival Kingdom—”
“I thought we were united in brotherhood now?”
“Will you shut up!”
“Sorry.” 
“As I was saying— to help a rival kingdom at the expense of Camelot!”
“Not really.”
“Excuse me?”
“I mean, it’s not going to cost Camelot anything. As I understand it, King Llewelyn’s going to pay me.”
~
“Er… yes…” the Envoy floundered a little on how to address Merlin before settling for “sir”.
~
‘Training’ in this case is another word for ‘Arthur hitting the boy with his sword until he falls over’.

“I think you said I was amazing. That’s what I think you said.” “You were mistaken. You should bathe more often—you’ve got dirt in your ears.”
~
“My dad and I don’t get along at all. It’s he’s oil and I’m...what’s that thing that’s always disappointing oil? Oh, that’s right, it’s me.” ~ Tim bobs his head a little. “Anthropology: understanding the human condition.” He turns around in the chair. “It’s what we do.”  “I thought we tracked it down and beat the shit out of it,” Dick says, and there’s hope for Tim still, because his mouth quirks a fraction upwards. “Apparently that’s called participant observation.”  ~
Bruce was fantastic at saying “I don’t give a damn what you think of me” without moving a muscle. Tim tries for the same. Montoya smirks at him, which makes him assume he didn’t get it quite right. 
~
“I think we need to keep Tim.” 
“We are keeping Tim,” Cassie reminds him. 
“No, I mean locked in the basement.” 
“Try,” Tim says, and he’s only partly kidding. Kon’s learning to tell these things. 
“Oh, man. I bet Mom would let me keep him. He can sleep on the foot of my bed...” Cassie groans. 
Kon peers at her. “I’m not so sure I like that idea...” 
Cassie smiles without opening her eyes. “You don’t have to. I’d throw you over for these feet.” 
“I’d throw you over, first,” Kon answers. 
“I’d rather go with Cassie,” Tim interjects. “She’s cuter.” 
“You don’t get a vote,” Kon mutters. 
“What are we talking about?” The speed means it’s Bart. 
“Keeping Tim.” 
“I’d make a special bat-proof room so he couldn’t escape, and then I’d feed him cake!” Bart announces. The room falls silent. Kon twists to peer at the young speedster. “Why are we keeping him?” Bart asks. 
“You’re really random sometimes,” Kon says, and lets his head fall back to the floor when Tim starts walking again. 
“I’d go with him,” Tim says thoughtfully. “I mean, cake.” 
~ “Shall I bring cocoa to your room, sir?” asked the butler. “Or do we prefer to do our brooding in the study this evening?” ~ “Alfred, where’s my mask?”
“I believe you hurled it in the general direction of the dinosaur, Master Robin.” Alfred informed him, fastidiously brushing the glassware on the lab bench with his feather duster.  ~
“But I’ve been sixteen for like, two years! I mean, I’m growing now, but shouldn’t that make me eighteen or something?” 
“Or two,” Dick points out. 
~
“You’ve lost your mind,” Roy told him solemnly. 
“Can’t lose what you never had!” Grace shouted, striding into the room.  ~
Nightwing’s eyes widened. His face twitched, running through oh-shit,-caught,-not-doing-anything-wrong and then into Bat-mode. If not for the superspeed, Wally probably wouldn’t have seen it. He looked at Dick suspiciously. “What’s going on?” 
~
“Anyone know where we put the shackles?” Bart asked, zipping into the room. 
“Kory’s room,” Tim said without blinking. Bart left. 
~ “The newspaper said his last words were that he loved me more than all the stars in the universe. Now that I’m a scientist I know that it means that his love was infinite and ever-expanding.” ~
“I made a list of the advantages and disadvantages of standing up to Ted because I stood up to Ted and wanted to know the advantages. There are none.” ~ “I tried to stop you. Ted is like the angle in a triangle opposite from the hypotenuse. He’s always right.” “You did not try to stop me.” “I tried to try. My head was screaming “No!” but my mouth was chewing gum.” ~
“I don’t mean to be the smug bastard who stands around saying ‘I told you so’ every time something goes wrong,” Jim says, “but I told you so, you know.” Spock doesn’t answer. Or if he does, it’s in the form of an Eyebrow Movement or something similar in which case Jim is in no position to tell, because it’s pitch dark in here and he’s lying on his back with his hands tied underneath him and Spock, as far as he can tell, is lying across his knees.
~
“I stand corrected,” Spock says dryly. “When we return to the ship—”
“—you’ll look it up and find out I’m right and be annoyed with yourself,” Jim says blandly. Sulu snickers.
~
“He is likely to find out about it relatively soon,” Spock says.
“Yes,” Jim agrees, “but if I’m lucky we’ll be in public and he won’t be able to yell at me.” Spock looks as amused as Spock ever looks, which Jim counts as a win. ~ “Only in a dream,” Clark replied, being unintentionally cryptic. ~ He still dresses like he’s undercover all the time, his just-faded-enough jeans and bland T-shirt all exactly, calculatedly, perfect for his early twenties college-kid demographic. Dick wonders for the hundredth time if Tim has ever bought something just because he thought it was cool and resolves to get him a cheesy-logo T-shirt or something, the next time he sees him. ~ “Let’s not talk about the pancakes,” Dick muttered. “Oh, no, I’d like to hear this. What about the pancakes?” “I was twelve!” Dick protested. “He put extra eggs in the pancakes. Had some theory about how it would taste like scrambled egg-pancakes.” “I was twelve!” Dick howled again. ~ “I can’t find the baking powder. Think baking soda would work?” Tim asked. There was a moment of silence while Alfred prayed someone said ‘no.’ “It might,” Bruce said after a moment. “Try.” ~ “You like me,” Arthur said confidently, and felt Merlin go stiff against him. Some of the certainty drained out of Arthur, and he turned his head to look at Merlin. “You do, don’t you?” he asked quietly, willing to be wrong about a great many things except for this.
~
“No enchanted shields this time,” he says, when Merlin is putting on his armour for a smaller tournament than the one with Valiant. “No snakes. No undead knights?”  “I don’t know why you think I’m the one to go to when people are out to kill you,” Merlin mutters, frowning at the clasp as though he’s never done it before, and must concentrate. “You’re the one with the sword who likes to hit things.” 
~
“I clean my room when I’m exhausted,” Merlin remarks. Arthur rests his hand on the pommel of his sword and waits, because there has to be more. Either that, or Merlin’s finally lost his mind. Merlin shrugs with a rueful grin. “I think I’m in your chambers and have to clean. Gaius is thrilled—my room is spotless.”  ~
She inhales and frowns, her eyebrow lifting even higher. “Is he drunk?”  “No!” Merlin shouts, right in Arthur’s ear. 
Arthur says, wryly, “Entirely.”  “You’re a goo’ fr’nd,” Merlin informs him with a stupid, open smile.  “You’re very drunk, and I’m going to remind you of this moment for the rest of your life,” Arthur replies.
~
Morgana sailed up to him with a smug look. “You’ll be the talk of the castle at this rate,” she said, dashing any hopes Merlin had that he looked anything other than supremely well-fucked.
~ In which dragons and ghosts amd prejudices are confronted, Merlin wears a hat (twice) and a dress (once), Arthur breaks some crockery (lots), there are more pranks than pillow fights but at least one of each, and many secrets are revealed.
~ He snapped his fingers at the nearest passing servant, who gave a startled but surprisingly elegant bow. Arthur blinked and then remembered that this was normal, and then wondered if he could somehow convince Merlin to start doing it. Unlikely.
~ He tried to sound lordly instead of desperate, but she was almost out of earshot in the crowded room and Arthur needed that alcohol right the hell now.
~
“My lord,” he said as he straightened up. Arthur, taken aback, was about to say something sarcastic and approving when Merlin added, “Help!” in a frantic hiss, and then his face changed and he looked like Merlin again. “Prince Arthur,” the woman behind him trilled, and swept her way forward to curl a heavily-ringed hand around Merlin’s arm. Merlin mouthed Help one more time; Arthur bit his lip and fought very hard not to howl with laughter. “Allow me to express my sincere admiration for the efforts your court has gone to on our behalf.”
~ Arthur kept smiling and fuck, what was her name, she was the one with the puffy red hair piled up almost as high as her head again, probably a few years shy of Uther’s age, and he’d completely forgotten her name two seconds after being introduced to her because Merlin had been blowing feathers out of his face and scowling in Arthur’s peripheral vision. Not unlike what he was doing now, in fact. ~ “Delightful food, and such elegant trimmings, and of course the other decorations are difficult to fault as well,” and she— was she— she was actually stroking Merlin’s arm. Arthur felt his own mouth give a helpless twitch, and Merlin’s scowl became something between a glare and a pleading look, but the lady— E, her name started with E, Ester, Emily, Emilia, that was it— seemed to take Arthur’s expression as some kind of encouragement, because she went on: “Your highness’s manservant has been most attentive, and I hope you won’t mind if I continue to monopolise his services. Such an obliging and handsome young man,” she purred, looking at Merlin with a predatory expression that seemed to completely overlook the way he was practically vibrating with the desire to escape. Arthur schooled his face into polite interest again and had time to take two steadying breaths before he realised that, oh holy buggering god, she was asking his permission. “Er,” he said helpfully. “Yes?” Her hand was doing the stroking thing again. Arthur allowed himself one long, wonderful moment in which he pretended to consider the request and Merlin made horrified NO NO NO motions, and then he gave his most charmingly apologetic smile.  ~ The steward gave Arthur one of those perfectly pitched glances that only the most experienced servants could manage. It said: I tried to get him to leave, and I wish to share a moment of disdain with you while simultaneously acknowledging that if we were to ever actually share anything of substance, I would let you have nine parts out of ten. As is only your due. Because you are the Crown Prince.  Arthur was fascinated, and wondered if he could order Merlin to take lessons in that kind of glance, because his manservant’s repertoire seemed to consist of ‘I’m confused’, ‘I think you’re an idiot’, and the slightly more complicated ‘I know you’re the Crown Prince and I still think you’re an idiot, because apparently I like being thrown in the stocks’. ~ “I think I may have found something related to that problem we were discussing earlier,” He made an incredibly unsubtle come on, come on motion with his head, and Arthur considered punching him. ~ “Stay here and talk about barley again, you were good at that,” he ordered. “I’ll distract her.” Merlin gave him a look of fervent gratitude. “Have I mentioned that sometimes you’re a bearable human being?” “Sit. Hide. If she can turn into a simpering mess on your behalf, I’m sure she’ll appreciate talking to someone who actually possesses a modicum of charm.” “That rules you out, then.” “Watch and learn,” Arthur said airily, and strode in the direction of the fluffy red hair. ~ Arthur hid around the corner with Merlin, thinking that it was quite ridiculous how accustomed he was becoming to sneaking around his own castle. ~ He drew a few odd looks when he was at the water pump, but Arthur met them with looks informing the onlookers that he was the heir to the throne and if he wanted to pump his own water then he was perfectly entitled to do so. When he pushed Gaius’s door open again, Gaius and Merlin were huddled over a bowl; their conversation stopped and both of their heads snapped up as Arthur entered. “It’s impolite to send the Crown Prince away so that you can gossip about him behind his back,” Arthur told them. ~
“It’s my fault,” Merlin said. “I accidentally switched places with myself.” “Yourself from a year ago,” Arthur said for clarification’s sake, looking at Merlin-from-last-year, who still looked completely dumbfounded. “I didn’t know you could do that.” “Well, neither did I,” Merlin said. “Hence the ‘accidentally’.” ~ Merlin-from-now gave him a look, and then turned to his past self. “I have to send you back now. You can’t tell Arthur what’s happened— well, you can tell him a year from now after this is all over. By which time you’ll be me.” ~ “I’m sorry, you’re gonna have to use smaller words if you want insult me. Brain’s asleep.” ~ “Fell’s Books,” a familiar voice said, and a surge of something Crowley told himself firmly was neither warmth nor relief rose up from his toes and into his chest— only to melt away again as the voice continued: “I’m afraid we aren’t available to take your call.” ~ He didn’t know how to use it very well; he knew that the red light meant he had a message, but he’d forget to check, and if he remembered to check his method was to solemnly push buttons at random in hopes that it would do something, and three in ten times that actually resulted in him hearing the messages, as opposed to deleting them, programming the prime minister into his call recognition, or setting the little machine’s internal time zone to Nova Scotia. ~ “You cannot harm me, mortal,” he shouted above the wind. “When I have been burnt by the fires of Hell, your paltry—” was it paltry? Yeah, that was it, “—magics are nothing to me.”  “You looked pretty harmed to me,” the wizard rasped back, missing Crowley’s subtle hint completely, and starting to take his feet. ~ “See, now that’s the kind of love that gets your name in prison tattoos.”  ~ “Christo,” Sam muttered at his brother and flicked his flashlight onto Dean’s face to watch for a flinch. Dean did flinch, but it was more the ‘Little brother just flashed light in my eyes’ than ‘I’m a demonically possessed evil bastard’ type. 
“What was that for?” “Anytime anyone in our family says ‘howdy,’ they’re possessed.” Dean paused, the expression on his face showing he was thinking about that. “Fair enough. Good call.” ~ “Find your inner centre. Go to that place of peace.” “Hey lady, shut up! We’re trying to have an argument here,” Dean called out in the direction of the voice. ~ “Well, it’s not the name my parents gave me, obviously” the girl said, traces of reluctance in her voice. “But you can’t always keep the names people give you. They’re cages that keep the soul from flying free. They are the banks and I am the river, they can try to curb me but I will always wear down any barriers.” Sam didn’t need to see his brother’s expression to guess what it was. ~ Penny finds out three days later that the conversation in the stairs was about how Sheldon treats her, which is, as Leonard puts it: with something that almost resembles respect and certainly better than he has any other female in their entire friendship and that that indicates a higher level of intimacy than just friendship, especially when looked at relative to how he treats everyone else. She’s developed this filter in her brain that hears what the guys are saying and spits it out in normal-person English, so what she actually hears Leonard saying is: I told Sheldon I think he has a crush on you.  ~ Before she can pick up on it Tony’s out of his chair, still holding her hand, and getting down on one knee. Emma looks somewhere between horrified and homicidal. She doesn’t need to read his mind to know what’s coming. The entire restaurant knows what’s coming. The occasional glances have turned into frantic searches for a camera phone. ~ “Actually, I think as Chief Medical Officer you sort of are my psychiatrist.” Jim points out. “Please don’t share with me what goes on in your head, I’m begging you. Being in space is scary enough; I don’t think I could handle what goes on in the dark depths of your mind.” “You just couldn’t handle my brilliance.” “I think what would disturb me the most is that after you peel away the surface layer of: ‘I’m so awesome! I’m so awesome! Ow! I just got punched in the face! Hey! Look! Boobs! I’m so awesome! I’m so awesome! Ow! I just got punched in the face.’ that I would just be staring at a vast black hole of nothingness.” Jim frowns. “I check out asses too.” “I bet you do.” “And, isn’t a black hole of nothingness kind of redundant?” “Are you going to tell me what you came in here to tell me or am I going to have to bang my head against this desk until I pass out and don’t have to listen to you anymore?” McCoy demands.  ‘You know you love me,” Jim grins. “Less and less every second.” McCoy grumbles. ~
“Chekhov punched that asshole? Who cares?”
“That’s what I said, but apparently I’m not supposed to let that type of thing happen and I need to investigate and there’s supposed to be disciplinary action. I can’t. It would be like kicking a puppy.” McCoy shrugs. “Make Spock do it.”
“You give terrible advice.” “He said ‘no’ didn’t he?” Jim nods and then frowns. “I think he was laughing at me.” “I’m laughing at you, too. You had a fight with Spock about which one of you has to be the bad parent and you lost. That’s hilarious.” “I don’t want to kick the puppy.” Jim frowns. “Then don’t. People say ‘No! Bad Puppy!’ or honestly I don’t know what the fuck they do to discipline puppies, I’ve never had a damn dog, and can we please stop referring to a person as a puppy, it’s creeping me out.” ~ “If people just went around punching superior officers because they were assholes, there would be anarchy, and I’d be very bruised.”  ~ “Officially, after a brief, but thorough investigation, it has been concluded that while your method of calling attention to the problem was unconventional, your actions exposed a serious problem with Lieutenant Oslo’s performance of his duties and overall demeanour.” Chekhov grins in relief. “Unofficially, if you do anything that stupid again, I will spank you. In public.”
“You can’t do that!” “You can’t punch superior officers, even if they are assholes,” The Captain says sitting up straight in his chair. “If you even feel the need to punch someone again, come find me. You can punch me.” ~ “You’re dismissed. Be good. And do me a favour and act like I was really mean and scary. I don’t want everyone thinking they can get away with insubordination.” ~ Jim loves playing Chess with Spock because he can drive Spock crazy by making the most irrational, illogical moves. Of course, driving Spock crazy means getting him to frown at him slightly or maybe, if he’s especially lucky, an annoyed tap of his finger on the table, but Jim knows that inside Spock is seething at the fact that Jim’s completely irrational move have messed up his plans, and that’s enough to totally delight Jim. ~ “The logical answer isn’t always the conventional one,” Spock observes. “How profound of you.”
“Check,” Spock says, making his move on the board. Jim looks down at the board. “Motherfucker!” Spock manages to look smug without altering the expression on his face. Jim has no clue how he does it. It’s irritating.  ~ “I don’t make a habit of engaging in betting,” Spock protests. It’s most definitely not a denial. “I want half,” Jim demands. “You manipulated me so that you could win a bet. I want half.” “You chose to get in that fight of your own free will,” Spock observes. “Half. Spock.”
“I was trying to teach them all a lesson in the futility of gambling.” “And now I’m teaching you a lesson in the dangers of not including me in betting pools. We’re all learning valuable things today.” “Half,” Spock concedes.  ~ “What did you do yourself this time?” he asks. “Pick a fight with Sulu and his amazing sword?” It was a joke, but Jim looks guilty, and McCoy rolls his eyes. “Oh, you couldn’t help yourself, could you? As if there aren’t enough things in space that can kill a man, you’ve got to start messing around with swords,” complains McCoy. ~
“No. Who? I mean, what guy?” Robin cleared her throat. “Um, no idea what you’re talking about.”
“That guy,” the woman said, pointing to the other side of the lobby where Ted was trying to look casual and hide behind a pillar at the same time. ~ The Captain holds up his hands. ‘Okay, guys, nice technobabble. Very enlightening. Can you do it?’ ~ The neighbour kid comes over and threatens to throw rocks at his head. Actually, what he says is, “If you do not lower the volume to standard acceptable parameters I will be forced to an extreme action such as creating new ventilation for your brain matter.” And he’s holding a nasty looking rock while he says it. ~ “It doesn’t hurt any more,” says Kirk, still struggling. “That’s nice,” says McCoy absently, “now stay down.” “No, it— I can’t even feel it. It’s just numb.” McCoy looks at him, then gently applies pressure to the wound. Kirk doesn’t even wince. “Well, now we have a symptom,” says McCoy, sitting back on his heels. “And you’re still bleeding.” “And is it warm in here to anybody else, or is it just me?” Kirk adds. McCoy lays a hand on his forehead. “Make that two symptoms.” “Do I have to stay on the floor? It feels weird being on the floor.” “Yes, Jim, you have to stay on the floor, because if you don’t stay on the floor you’ll bleed out and die and on your tombstone it’s going to read, ‘Here lies James Tiberius Kirk—’” “Don’t put ‘Tiberius’ on my tombstone,” Kirk interjects, looking deeply offended. “‘—James Tiberius Kirk, murdered by knife-throwing Lysurean ninjas on a routine diplomatic mission.’ How does that sound, Jim?” “Take out the Tiberius and it sounds fine,” Kirk retorts blurrily. “There are worse ways to go than ninjas.” “There are better ways to go,” McCoy disagrees, “Like not at all.” ~ “How many fingers am I holding up?” “Three, but they’re very condescending.” ~ “Jim, you’re not going to die. You know why? Because I haven’t lost a single person on our goddamned ship since we got her, and you’re not going to break my record, you bastard, you hear?” ~ “You’ve got a blanket—two blankets— and you’re—” he pauses for a moment to grapple with a word of several syllables “—divulging personal information. What’s wrong?” Then, before Spock can answer, he slurs out, “Your eyebrows are the coolest thing I have ever seen in my whole freaking life,” Kirk says seriously, and McCoy considers writing it down so he can have the exact wording to throw back in his face later on. “I will be certain to tell hundreds of millions of years of evolution that you approve of their eyebrow-trait selection processes,” Spock informs him. Kirk turns to McCoy, even though his eyelids are already drooping again. “You should remember that,” he says. “For Vulcans, ‘sarcasm’ doesn’t count as an emotion.” “Sarcasm is a rhetorical technique,” Spock says, but Kirk is already unconscious again. Spock instead looks back to McCoy. “Sarcasm is a rhetorical—” “So I gathered,” says McCoy ~ “I’m waiting for someone with the balls to come up to me and tell me point-blank that I don’t deserve to be president solely because I’m a fag. Come on, Dobson, you’re getting soft in your old age. Bring it.” ~ Amid accusations that he is in bed with the meta-human community, President Drake commented, “Damn straight. Or not so much straight, but definitely bed” and walked off, hand-in-hand, with Superboy.   ~
“I could have hit him in such a way that he would die suddenly an hour later,” she said.
“Could you teach me something where I hit him and he quits being a jerk for an hour?”
~ He smirked a bit at that, although she couldn’t tell if it was a “got me there” smirk or a “wouldn’t you like to know” smirk. Nightwing. That was his name. Or alias. Or maybe it was his name, who could tell with these people?
~ “Then the last criminal pulls out a gun and waves it at Batman, and Batman gives him a look like, Bitch? Please. And then he moves....Well, I don’t know what happened next. I was too busy running away, wasn’t I?”
~
“You’re just people, right?” I said. “You’re not digging anybody up to eat them after you roast them?”
“What?” The guy who’d been sitting on me sounded outraged, so that was a good sign.
“And you’re not fucking them either, right?” I had to know. “Because then you have to roast them to kill the DNA you left behind.”
Perry made one of those noises he makes when he’s beyond being able to deal with anything. “Shut up, Harry!”
“Jesus, dude, what the fuck,” Sits On Me said. “Gross.”
~
“So you’re gonna dig this woman up, and then toss us in when you burn her, right?” I said. I was just trying to get things straight. I’m not cool with surprises, most of the time. I get a lot of bad surprises. Sits On Me straightened and leaned on his shovel. 
“Holy crap,” he said. “What is wrong with you guys? No one’s killing anybody. Just shut up. Take a nap or something.”
“How do you get into this type of thing, anyway?” I said. “A dare? Listening to Ozzy? Bad ‘shrooms?”
“He does shut up sometimes, right?” the taller one said.
“No,” Perry said. “It’s our version of waterboarding. Give up now, or the torture continues.”
~
“Sam?” I said. “What kind of serial-killing corpse-fucker goes by a name like Sam?”
“That thing I said about not killing anyone is gonna expire,” Sits On Me said, all growly. Damn, touched a nerve.
“So, how long have you two been together?” Perry said.
“They can’t even see us, and they think we’re gay,” Sits On Me said, sounding genuinely pissed. “That’s getting old. We’re brothers, you douchebag, not that it’s any of your business.”
“That’s even sicker,” I said. “You’re fucking your brother?” 
~
“You wouldn’t. Lighting someone on fire in this kind of heat, it’s... it’s... well—you’d get hot, too.” It’s three in the morning, and it’s still 105 degrees, so Dean doesn’t bother trying for coherency. The noise Sam makes this time is definitely a groan of frustration. “Stop talking. God. Why can’t you stop talking?”
~ “I can’t fucking believe this. Did we seriously get outsmarted by a big ball of fire?” “It’s a sentient ball of fire, possessed by the soul of a mountain man,” Sam says grimly. He’s still trying to get reception on his cell, despite the fact that they’re at the corner of Buttfuck and Nowhere. “I can’t believe we’re lost in a fucking canyon. In fucking Utah.” Dean sits down on a red rock that feels hot enough to burn his ass through his jeans. “This is kind of a record for us.” Sam glares at him. “We’re not *lost.* We’re in the Maze District of Canyonlands National Park. We’re just—” “Miles away from civilization with no way to get back and no water, and have I mentioned that it’s really creepy how much you remember from that park guidebook?” “Why? Because I actually took the time to find out something about where we were going, unlike some people?” Dean ignores the dig. “This is what happened to the Donner Party, isn’t it? Sam, if you eat me I’ll never forgive you.”
~
There was something oddly familiar about sword guy, and the memory tugged at him…. Wait a minute! He raised his visor, exposing his face. “I know you!” he exclaimed. Sword guy looked surprised at that. In fact, it was the most reaction Tony had got from him so far. 
“I’m sure I haven’t had the pleasure,” he replied, almost without missing a beat. “Yes!” Tony practically shouted, finally putting the pieces together. “You were a friend of my parents! You came to the house for dinner a few times.” He would have snapped his fingers if they hadn’t been encased in a gold titanium alloy. “Dr. Matthew Stone, the historian!”  “I’m afraid you have me mistaken for someone else,” he replied with total confidence. “Nice try.” He pointed at himself. “Genius. Perfect recall.”
“Oh, for god’s sake!” Tony continued, “You taught me to curse in Ancient Greek when I was four!” The smallest hint of a smile touched sword guy’s… Matthew’s, lips. “You were a natural,” he commented, no longer denying the truth.  “And then my mom found out,” Tony recalled, his voice tinged with sadness at the memory of his late mother.  “She was slightly peeved,” he admitted.

Half of Jim’s mouth curled into a smile. “That sounded a bit like insubordination to me, Doc.” “Good, you can still pronounce big words you don’t understand. You’re not too far gone.”
~
Mother didn’t yell, because ladies didn’t yell, but she spoke in a voice that left no question as to just how much trouble we were in.
~
“But...we haven’t done it. And Remus won’t let us copy his.” He rolled his eyes in the direction of his other friend.
“Then you’ll never learn it,” he said with a little smile that suggested he really just enjoyed seeing them panic. I gave him an approving nod.
~
“We practice of course. We have “being horrible and vindictive” lessons on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and we practice every day after lunch. Right before we practice being spoiled and petty, which we also excel at.”
~
“What is wrong with girls anyway?” he demanded, glaring at each of us in turn, apparently for the crime of being female.
~
“Just who the hell does he think he is anyway…” was pretty much the way all of Marlene’s comments began, and I more or less made noises of agreement that yes, Sirius could be quite a prat, and yes, men in general were all quite useless, and yes, we probably would be better off if they were all just eaten by hippogriffs.
~
He smirked. “You’re a horrible liar. One would think you’d be better at it, in our family, but you’re not. “Look of total panic” is not the way to go when asked a question.”
~
“I have a…meeting,” I said evasively. “My weekly meeting of the “none of your damn business” club.”
~
“You live in the same room nine months of the year and manage to avoid talking?”
“Actually, yes. Of course, I could tell him during those late nights when we’re all giggling and braiding each others’ hair. Spencer does a mean French braid…”
~
“I hope you’re bringing back my potions notes I was generous enough to lend you,” Ted began, immediately followed by “What’s wrong?”
“You’re going out with Andromeda Black?” Frank hissed, though nobody else was nearby.
“Um, I’m actually sitting right here,” I pointed out.
“What makes you think that?” Ted said reasonably.
“Sirius Black…”
“…has the biggest mouth in the bloody universe,” I finished.
“Are you insane?” Frank went on as though I hadn’t spoken. “That family is completely batshit crazy!” he glanced at me and added lamely, “No offence.” Normally, I would take offence at any comment against my family, but I was finding his little tantrum amusing.
“None taken, I’m sure in some cultures “completely batshit crazy” is a compliment.”
“Do you not realize who her sister is?” he went on.
Ted turned to me conversationally. “You have a sister?”
“Well, most people wouldn’t know that. Bella’s very quiet, shy, nondescript, would never draw attention to herself…”
~
“My mates are no good for this sort of thing. And Marlene is in Germany with her parents, and I wasn’t sure if it’s the sort of thing to ask her to help me with or if it would feel like I was pressuring her or something…anyway, then it occurred to me that you’re a girl.”
“Flattering as it is that you’ve known me for sixteen years and only just figured out I’m a girl, I have no idea what you’re talking about...”
~
“Shall I slap you or something? Just for effect?”
“That won’t be necessary, but Serena Pritchard is giving me hopeful looks, so please dance with me,” he grabbed my hand, and said Serena Pritchard gave me a deadly look.
~
A Slytherin fifth-year named Hugh Bulstrode had seen a Muggle film in which lots of Muggle cars crashed spectacularly and burst into flames. This he described in the common room in great detail accompanied by enthusiastic sounds effects, and led most of the Slytherins, who had little experience with Muggle things in general, to assume anyone who got in a Muggle car would end up in a fiery inferno.
~
“She’s engaged!” squealed Narcissa, no longer able to contain the news.
“Yeah, thanks Cissy, I gathered that,” I murmured, as Bella deigned to let me have a closer look at the ring. It was actually tasteful and simple if you could get past the fact that it was so bloody huge.
~
“The best part is really the presents. And of course, it’s a great racket for parents, because they can say Santa will only bring you presents if you’re good. So you can tell your children if they behave they’ll get loads of Christmas presents, but if they don’t behave…” he trailed off ominously, so I supplied what seemed like the obvious answer.
“He kills them?”
“No! Jesus, what kind of bloodthirsty mythical figures do you have?” ~
“Were you just planning to stand here?” came Ted’s voice from behind me.
“You know, a good boyfriend would help with my trunk.”
“One thinks a witch who’s only months away from taking seven N.E.W.T.s could levitate it to the train herself.”
“Yes, but why does one have a boyfriend if not to lift heavy things?”
“Do you really want me to answer that? Out loud? With all these people around?”
~ “It is a word that has no true Tau’ri translation,” Bra’tac said as Daniel leant forward, his interest perked despite his misgivings. “One who… bleats?” Daniel scrunched his face and Bra’tac let out another rumble of low laughter.  ~
With that, he released their hands and gestured that Max should bloody well go ahead and kiss his bride before something else happened to disrupt it.
~ The Diwali party is a fiasco. Considering the normal state of affairs aboard the Enterprise it takes a lot for something to be considered such. It’s when Jim catches himself on fire that shit begins to get really out of hand. Sara is chatting with Fatima...ok, she’s gossiping like crazy with Fatima about McCoy, which is a hobby for most of the medical staff, when Jim knocks over one of the lamps. He decides slapping the oil fire out with his hand is an excellent course of action and pretty soon the veil of his sari is ablaze and Pavel is screaming in Russian and Hikaru comes to the rescue with pineapple juice and about then Sara loses sight of the action since she’s not getting up unless the ship’s attacked.  ~
“Help, help, sanctuary!” Jim sweeps into her office and locks the door, bounds over to the door to Sickbay and locks it too. He dramatically presses his back to the wall and points a finger at her. “SANCTUARY!”
“Are you guys playing laser tag again?” Sara turns back to her Saturnalia planning.  “I feel that your attitude lacks the adequate level of concern a request for sanctuary should elicit.” Jim crosses his arms over his chest. ~ Uhura learns to say “no,” “no, thank you,” and “if you touch me again I’ll break your hand” in three Romulan dialects, two Vulcan, and conversational Klingon. Though, really, with Klingon, it’s the accompanying hand gesture that truly hammers the point home. ~ McKay’s face passed through six different emotions in less than ten seconds, and John made a mental note to teach him at least the basics of subtlety before they went out on any missions. McKay finally settled on a mixture of stunned adoration and blind panic, and John made another mental note to play poker with him before he taught him subtlety.  ~ “I’m going to kill him,” Jim snapped. “Let me in now.” “That’s a real persuasive argument. Let me think about it. Hmm, let’s see. No. Come back later, after you’ve cooled off.” ~
Batman steps out of the shadow. “And that’s where you’ll come in. Do you know the tensile limit of that lasso?”
“It has the strength of Mother Earth.”
“I’ll take that as a no. The rift will widen the longer it’s kept open. Your lasso may be able to contain it, and stop it from engulfing Earth.”
~ The Green Lantern looks the worst of any of them. He has a split lip and his eye is beginning to swell closed. “Join the corps! See the galaxy! Get beaten up by the grateful populace you freed from slavery!” he says, translucent green ice bag clasped to his face.
~
One evening, he comes down to the library and asks, “Diana, do you want children?”
She so shocked she nearly says, certainly not with you, but recovers herself in time. “In a... vague and distant way, perhaps?”
Bruce’s relief is almost comical. “Good! I mean uh. I’m glad to hear—”
~
“Kal,” says Diana brightly, re-entering the room. Kal flinches. “Do you have another screen I can watch the rest of the message on? I seem to have accidentally stabbed the other one with my sword.”
“Yeah,” says the Flash despondently. “He always made me feel that way too.” He wipes the back of his fist across his face. “Poor Bats. I can’t believe, it you know? I expect him to jump out and say boo at any time.”
~
“I take it Kal showed you the video then,” he says, sounding annoyed.
“You said I ‘surpassed the stars like the setting moon over the sea.’.”
“I may have become somewhat sentimental contemplating my death,” he says, but not with conviction.
~
“Put me down, you idiot,” says Batman. “I can’t believe you showed her the video.”
“J’onn said you were dead!” protests Superman.
~
“But you can get drunk?” There’s a slight twitch on Spock’s face that on anyone else would be a long-suffering sigh. He’s not so inscrutable. Jim’s willing to bet his pants that he could own Spock at poker, if he could just get the boring bastard to ante up.
“Earthly alcohols have no effect upon the race of my father,” Spock says, which is circuitous and oblique, even for him (or maybe especially for him) by which Jim assumes: “But you can and you have!” He snaps his fingers, points, gives his best annoying grin. “How, when, where and what did you do that’s so embarrassing you don’t want to talk about it?” Spock sets his beer aside, half-full, that faint frown puckering his brow that covers everything from I appear to have been given the wrong breakfast again to rampaging miners from the future are blowing up planets.
~
He’s bouncing off the bar before he even realises he was flinching back. “You,” he says, accusatory to cover it. “Are not nearly as intoxicated as you appear to be,” Spock finishes, as smoothly as though this were an academic exercise; which of these responses best suits the scenario? Jim thinks he’s offended. “Yeah,” he drawls. “I’ll throw up on your shoes.” Spock glances down, as though calculating the probable trajectory, then says, “I doubt you currently possess the co-ordination to hit a moving target.”
~
“Hey,” Lois snapped in his ear. “You didn’t mention there was more than one of you. That you have helpers and... uh...”  “Peacekeepers,” chirped one, snapping his heels together with a smile of pure, radiant joy.   “O-kay,” Lois intoned slowly.
~
“A wedding gift?” he proposed, then stopped and did that thing again— the ever so careful ‘is this where you have that nervous breakdown?’ pause— and looked in her direction.  ~ The Chandran race are interesting from a Terran linguistic point of view because of the great gravity and unhurriedness of their thoughts. What would be a brief “hello” on Earth is a ritual taking three standard days; saying “I love you” must be done over several months, preferably when the planet is in a specific point in its orbit, as to incorporate elements of seasonal change and variations in tides. Lovers’ tiffs on Chandra V have outlived many Federation linguists. ~
“Hi. You died. Twice. Kate was really mad at you, she threw things.” “I’m sorry?” he suggests.
~ “I learned something new today,” Tony says proudly when Pepper picks up the phone. There’s a pause. “Tony, it’s a quarter to three in the morning.” “Okay, so, technically, I learned this yesterday.” ~ “Okay, I’m seeing a rock. A rock surrounded by giant floating triangles. They’re probably symbolic floating triangles.” “What do you think they’re symbolic of?” “I don’t know. The artist’s antagonistic relationship with geometric shapes, I guess. Maybe he was savaged by a rogue hexagon as a child.”
~
If yesterday, someone had said to Penny, “You’re going to end up driving a car full of squealing geeks to ComicCon,” Penny would’ve responded like this: No, Sheldon, I am not. But here it was, not yesterday or a few years ago, here it was today and she had just finished driving a car full of squealing geeks to ComicCon. Wolowitz begged (on his knees, leering), Raj looked at her pleadingly, Leonard apologized that his car was broken and asked politely. Sheldon told her that, as he understood it, the road trip was a necessary and non-optional bonding experience for groups of friends, such as theirs.  ~
“He’s a theoretical scientist,” Sheldon announced. “He asked ‘why.’ Experimental scientists want to know what else will explode. Engineers ask ‘how’ and everyone else just says ‘do it again.’”
~
“Sammy’s scared of me.” Sam flinches like a startled horse, looks at him with wide eyes and a quickly shaking head.
“Sammy’s a big princess who doesn’t know how to control his reactions around his family. He was the baby, kid. He never had to.”
“Don’t call me the baby, Dean—”
“Shut your hole and tell ‘im you’re not scared of him.”
~ “Now, hold on. I am going to ignore how creepy talking metal is right now, but we are going to have a talk about this later. Death is kind of a harsh punishment for stealing, not that we stole anything. I’m pretty sure we don’t have this guys stuff. We just met.”
~
As a preface to this peculiar narrative of mine, let me enlighten you on one point: I am never as drunk as I seem.
~
It used to be better. When they wanted to talk from different rooms, they would send their maids back and forth between them. But then they caught on to how time-consuming it was to rely on messengers and so resorted to screeching instead.
~
Parvati’s fingers were gentle as she prodded his shoulder, but it seemed to scream at the slightest touch, and Neville pulled back, screwing up his face as he hissed in protest. She rolled her eyes, swatting him on the chest. “Oh, stop it. How am I supposed to be impressed by my brave warrior’s heroic injuries if he’s such a baby about them?”
Neville smiled ruefully. “You’re not supposed to poke them. You’re supposed to look at them and make sympathetic noises.”
~
“Have you decided you fancy….” He paused, remembering what his Gran had called it. “That you like to stir your cauldron in the same direction?”
~
“The Ravenclaw dormitory will never have a Doxie problem. We get fumigated every night when Mike takes his shoes off.”
“Keep it up, and I’ll jinx your lips shut, Boot.” Michael blushed.
“Note,” Terry said archly, shaking out the black robes, “that he does not argue my essential point.”
~ In her robes, she seemed quite plain, even a little dumpy, but he now realized that the loose black garments were simply extremely unflattering to the rather extraordinary figure they had been concealing. With a great effort, Neville tore his eyes upward to hers. “Um….” To his horror, he found that he was completely unable to remember what she had asked.
The knowing glitter in Hannah’s eyes told him that she had not in fact missed where his attention had drifted, and she giggled. “I said, can I tag along?”
“Sure.” He wanted to say more, but his brain seemed to be malfunctioning due to the Confundus Charm that had clearly been placed on Hannah’s sweater.
~
“I mean, I’ve certainly had my share of dalliances in the past, but this is different, and I do not refer merely to the vast improvement in the quality of the snogging.”
~
“Mistress,” the little house-elf addressed his companions with an air of infinite long-suffering patience, “puts up with much from Master Neville, but he tries to be a good boy, Merlin knows.” Lee was trying not entirely successfully to stifle giggles, and Neville felt immensely satisfied when Mimsy silenced him with one of the looks he had spent his entire childhood attempting to avoid ~ “Mistress will be happy to help the friends of Harry Potter do anything against those nasty Death Eaters. Lee Jordan will have food and the best care and a nice bed and…” she wrinkled her button-like nose, “most certainly a hot bath as soon as possible, because Master Neville’s friend does not smell very good.”
“Hey, you try living in a doorway for three days wearing something Remus Lupin had consigned to the rag bag.”
To his shock, Mimsy swatted him swiftly upside the head, and Neville barely managed to stifle a giggle. “Mistress will not take cheek, and neither will Mimsy! Lee Jordan smells bad, and Lee Jordan will be washed and fed, and he will be grateful!”
~
“Angry?” All the sternness melted away, and she drew herself up to her full height, her eyes glowing. “I don’t think I’ve ever been prouder of you! A ‘serious discipline problem’…I should have it framed.”
~ With a sudden crack, a pair of bagpipes appeared there, and he began to blow into them with an enthusiasm that was only matched by his profound lack of skill.
~ There had already been two fights, one throat almost sliced in a grossly unwise attempt to charm a razor, and Euan Abercrombie had nearly drowned in the sink after a sixth-year climbed over him to get to the mirror. “That’s it, I’m pulling rank! Jack, hand over the cologne before you poison us all. Ritchie, if you put any more Setting Potion on your hair, your head will deflect the Killing Curse. Les, get your wand away from your face, she has Spot Remover. Geoff, give that back to whoever you borrowed it from. Colin, I am not donating more blood if you slice your face open with that thing, and it’s all blonde anyway.”
~
“I’m not a kid!” Geoff Hooper looked highly offended, planting both hands on his hips. “I’m in the D.A., aren’t I?”
“Using one of these seriously yet?” Neville gestured towards the boy with his razor.
“Not exactly.”
“Do you honestly know how Andy was going to finish that sentence?”
Geoff looked down, his hands falling to his sides. “No,” he admitted.
Neville nodded as he finished touching up the last bit on his chin and rinsed his face in the basin. “Then you’re a kid.”
~
Neville gave the violent snuff box a long, sceptical look. “Isn’t it supposed to be a squirrel? I didn’t think they had fangs.”
“Irish squirrel.”
“That’s funny,” he crossed his arms, regarding his friend with a look of deep innocence, “because I know I don’t always have the best memory, but my Gran and I went to Dublin for a weekend to visit a friend of hers when I was nine, and I think ravenous, rampaging, carnivorous squirrels would have made a bit of an impression. Especially when I spent so much time outside in the back garden.”
Seamus gave a hopeful, sheepish little smile. “Northern Irish squirrel?”
~ He thought his name was Terry, unless he was in trouble, when it was Tiresius Wolfric Boot Stop That At Once. By the time he was three, he had figured out that the last four words weren’t really part of his name. It took another two years to realize that the first three were, and not just when he had been “a pain.”
~ The entire carriage ride was a litany of ‘angel’ and ‘goddess’ and ‘goddess’ and ‘angel’... making me wish all the more that he’d leafed through a greater number of books in his life and so acquired a somewhat less limited vocabulary.
~
Parker had a familiar confused and disgruntled “Why am I doing this again?” look on her face and Hardison seemed like he wanted to flee. Eliot just looked aggravated, but that was kind of his default setting.
~
“Rupert,” says I, when the good valet is sponging off my head that night, “you’re good at reconnaissance, right?”
“You mean, eavesdropping?”
“Not just eavesdropping, but lurking, stalking, tracking, peeping...”
“Peeping, hmmm, now that sounds interesting!”
“No! Nothing lewd. Just, you know, if you happen to see a nice clump of shrubs along a road where a certain person might be walking, you wouldn’t hesitate to use it as cover, am I correct?”
“Who shall I have to cover myself from? My conscience’s clear and so’s my credit. I haven’t run up any debts in town, yet.”
“That’s because out here, in the countryside, people employ roosters for other things beside—”
“Oh, stuff it, Gil. Now what do you want me to do?”
~
Bingley rolled his eyes up into his head, as if searching for the stray, scattered thoughts within, “I thought I mentioned him in my letter.”
“Your letter? You mean that abysmal scrap of blotting paper?”
~
Down a corridor we go and into a small study with few books and an inaccurate globe that has Africa pasted to the bottom of the world and Europe divided by a dragon-filled sea. He points to this geographical disaster and says, smiling proudly, “I made that in a cartography class back when I was in school. Isn’t it nice?”
~
“Ah, yes. Well, to put this simply, I have sensed certain…malicious entities at work in the mystical planes. This is nothing new, of course, but the extents to which the powers of magic are being tapped into are astounding and unprecedented.”
“So basically, you feel a disturbance in the Force,” Flash paraphrased.
“Yes…” said Fate hesitantly, although I had the feeling he had completely missed the pop culture reference. I glared at Flash, hopefully preventing a string of even worse follow-up jokes, and then turned back to Dr. Fate.
~
“Roy Harper told me that going there is like signing up for the class with the most babes, then the professor comes in and you find out it’s the 20th Century Advanced Feminism course, based on the subtopic that all men must die a slow and painful death.”
~
“A massive pain. A multi-dimensional construct with glitches is not easy to debug.” Clark Kent, aka Superman, slumped down to the table. “Knew that the whole thing spontaneously reconstructing itself was too easy. Anything interesting happen while I was away?”
~
“Careful, he’s got enough of a swollen head as it is.”
“Why does everybody think I have a titanic ego?”
“Not everybody, Bruce. Just those you’ve met.”
~
One has a crescent-shaped birthmark on her cheek— I shall call her Moony. The other, whose mouth hangs open, I shall call Trout.
~
“Hurst!” utters he, looking me up and down. “What are you doing here?”
“Contemplating my own idiocy,” I blurt out.
His face takes on a wry turn as he steps in. “Do you mind if I join you?” he asks. “I could assist you with your analysis.”
~
And so I found myself kneeling before the Prince Regent, whose first words— somewhat slurred— were: “I see in you gentlemen a reflection of myself— jolly good lads with my spirit for life!” This, though from the lips of a prince, was not a compliment. The Prince Regent George was (and still is) a debauched, debt-ridden, gambling, alcoholic adulterer. To be compared to him was the height of humiliation. I simmered with indignation, I boiled with anger, I roiled with rage... and if I weren’t such a damn coward I would have vented some of my spleen, as well.
~ “My good Hurst,” he began with that infuriating, good-natured calmness, “though your revolutionary proclamations quite inspire me, I must say that it is generally not a good idea to debate natural rights with a man who is drunk, bored, and more powerful than the two of us combined. Though we could attempt to escape from here and claim our rights as Englishmen, one rash action of an angry Regent— while capable of being redressed later— could bring about a few immediate consequences that might very well deprive us of life and limb.”
“What the bloody hell does that mean?”
“Given the gun-shaped bulge under his waistcoat, I’d say that he too has a pistol on his person. And I can’t promise you, my dear fellow, that it isn’t loaded and that, if it is loaded, he won’t scruple, in his drunken state, to hazard a few shots at us if we spoil his evening fun.”
~ “I heard you,” he muttered, a savage odour wafting from his mouth. “You think me... unhonourable?”
“Dishonourable,” Henry corrected, in the most polite of tones.
~
“Remember once, when I drank too much Turkish coffee and couldn’t fall asleep straightaway, you told me this tremendously dull story that made me doze in a matter of moments?”
I think hard. “It wasn’t a story,” I say, hitting upon her reference at last. “It was just my valet’s rendition of a typical day in my life.”
~
Did it just get sunnier in the room or is Bingley grinning? He says, rather unnecessarily, “I am so very glad to hear it.”
~
“Miss Bennet,” he says, “this is Colonel Wilhelm Von Glugerschplontz.”
I can see her silently mouthing the name to herself. “Pleased to meet you, Colonel.”
~ “How much do I... do I... I can’t put too much, because if I kill him, Rupert, then it’s not good. Then it’s a catastrophe of unbounded proportions, I mean religiously, and ethically, and the fact that I’ll be beheaded for sure.”
“I believe they hang murderers nowadays.” He shook his head. “Look, you slip a little bit in. It’ll make him a tad woozy, disoriented, unable to really get out of his seat, but semi-conscious nonetheless. And you’ll stay with him the whole time, like a real friend.”
“And what will you do?”
He shrugged. “Watch you through a window and laugh?”
~ “I am planning to restore good relations with you, Mr. Hurst, but first I have to fight back the last of my anger. After I have mastered my unholy impulses towards you, I shall embrace you as a friend.”
“Unholy impulses?”
He nods gravely. “Throughout our confrontation, and in the hours following, I was repeatedly possessed by the urge to run you through with a sword.” He pauses. “Forgive me, Mr. Hurst.”
~
I snort. “Did you ever think, Darcy, that people might express their feelings in different ways? And I imagine that if you ever did witness Miss Bennet clinging to my brother’s arm or praising him to the skies, you would not attribute love to her then, either. You would most likely think that she was a scheming, flattering little fortune-hunter.”
“I... would not,” he replies rather haltingly, revealing to me that in fact, he would.
~
“He’s threatening us!” Denny cries.
“You’re a sharp one, Benny Denny. I was making an attempt at subtlety, but apparently I underestimated the powers of your mind.”
“You’re being sarcastic, aren’t you?” he seethes.
“Again, you astonish me!” I sigh, clapping a hand to my heart.
~ I can hardly guess what answers I’m giving Mrs. Bennet. For all I know, I might be telling her that Bingley is really worth twenty thousand a year, that he owns a sizeable chunk of Canada, and that his townhouse in London is actually a seraglio stocked with lusty concubines and hordes of illegitimate children. ~ Before another saucy word can fly from her mouth, Caroline is upon us. “Look what happened to the train of my gown!” she cries, offering us a rear view of her fashionably spindly figure. Both Louisa and I peer very hard, but can detect nothing.
“Oh, please!” my sister-in-law exclaims. “Do you not see that tear along the very edge, between where the gold is sewn into the green?”
This time Louisa releases a little “oh!” though, to be quite honest, I can still see nothing.
~
A golden light erupts in the room, and I blink, shielding my eyes. “Bingley,” I command, “stop smiling, you’re blinding me!”
~
“I should say. He cuts quite a figure in his uniform.” Darcy casts me a strange look. “Objectively speaking,” I’m quick to add.
~
He looks back and forth between Darcy and me. I look at Darcy, attempting to convey, without words, my sheer bafflement and fear. Darcy looks at neither of us, opting instead to stare at some distant point beyond the Colonel’s head.
“Darcy,” I hiss, “what in the name of Hades is Colonel Fitzwilliam trying to tell us?”
Unfortunately, Fanciful Fitzwilliam overhears my frantic question and makes the reply. “Are you Mr. Gilroy H. Hurst?” he barks.
I fall into attention. “Y-yes, but without the middle initial.”
“Hmmm… I distinctly recall Darcy referring to you in his express as Mr. Gilroy H. Hurst.”
~ “Ah, Hurst, it’s you!” he cries, flying to his feet and raking a hand through his hair. He pauses, looking utterly confused. “Did you just profess your undying love for me?” he breathes.
“Something along those lines, why?” He stares at me in unconcealed horror as I struggle hard not to laugh. 
~
My terror further increases when he reaches out with a bloody hand and whispers, “Avenge me, Gil. Avenge my death…” and I begin to believe that all is lost. Only when he adds, “And have Cook send me some cinnamon buns on the morrow,” do I allow myself a glimmer of hope, particularly when he goes on to add that he would like them steeped in butter, slathered in cream, and served with hot tea. “To soothe my battered spirits,” he murmurs.
~
“Yes, yes… oh, Henry, the moment I get back there… the moment I arrive back at Netherfield I’ll – let the servants gape! – I’ll seal her mouth with a kiss, sweep her up in my arms, march up the stairs–”
“Falter on the sixth or seventh step,” he cuts in, “struggle for breath, set her on her feet, lean on her like a crutch, stagger up the remaining stairs and then…” I throw a cushion at him, which hits him squarely on the nose. 
~
When he sees that I’m all right, he pats my shoulder stiffly, clears his throat gruffly (I do the same, incidentally, though my throat-clearing sounds more like wheezing), and for a few long moments the two of us merely stand there trying to appear as manful and unaffected as possible. Darcy comments, in a rather deeper voice than usual, about the results of a boxing match he happened to come across in the papers, and I – not knowing a thing about sports – limit myself to some vigorous nodding and grunting.
~
“Gilroy,” she hisses, as I mount the first step, “what on Earth are you doing? Put me down this–”
“Silence,” I bid, with what I hope is an endearing smile. “You should be swooning in amorous rapture right about now.”
~ “I always did prefer her, above all the rest. What I can’t bear is that there won’t be an ‘all the rest’ anymore.”
“Hmmm… Lamentations on Monogamy, by Rupert Andrews. I wager it would sell like silk stockings in the ton.”
~
“You misunderstand,” I insist, freeing one of my hands so as to dash the merriment from my eyes. “I’m not laughing at you, I’m laughing at her! The stupid cow! Calling you – you, Louisa Hurst – a woman lacking in passion? That’s like saying that… that Mount Vesuvius never erupted and killed hundreds of people! It’s ridiculous!”
She allows a crooked smile to steal over her face. “Are you comparing me to a murderous volcano, Gilroy?” she inquires.
“All right, all right,” I groan, “so I’m not well-versed in the imagery of love. Shall I make another attempt? Louisa Hurst, you are the reddest rose, the brightest sun, the chirpiest nightingale, the—”
~ “I can guess at your thoughts: you are wondering how a man of my age could not be, erhm, could not be acquainted with all of this…”
No, I was actually wondering how he would react if I shouted, “Quick, look behind you!” and then ran out of the room. But now that he mentions it, how indeed does a man of his age— a man of sense and education – not know more of such things? I look at him expectantly.

“Workaholic,” Dick mutters into his cereal bowl, taking it over to the kitchen sink.
“You know,” Bruce says, “it’d be the easiest thing in the world for me to ground you right now. Since I’m over-worked and grumpy and obviously not in my right mind.”
“I didn’t say anything! I just said, wow, we have garlic?” Dick amends, pretending to go through their (very badly stocked) larder.
~
“You’re just bitter that you’re not Lex Luther,” Dick mumbles, dragging Bruce towards what has to be the world’s most giant, most amazing, most brilliant comic book store (he’d searched it up on Bruce’s laptop the week before they left, and printed out a map and highlighted it a thousand times just so Bruce wouldn’t miss it).
~
“You know,” Jack said, “the Doctor used to call him Ricky the Idiot.”
Ianto blinked. “His name’s not Ricky.”
“And he’s not an idiot, either, so there you go. Have a little faith. What’s the worst that can happen?”
“You really don’t want me to speculate that far.”
The proximity alarm clanged as the cog door rolled open. “Good morning, boys!” Gwen chirped, stepping out. “How’s— oh dear God in heaven, what is going on?”
“We’re not entirely sure yet,” Jack said, “but I think Ianto’s plotting insurrection.”
Gwen assessed the damage with wide eyes. Mickey waved at her cheerfully, then went back to deconstructing the mainframe. “Count me in,” she said.
“I’ve already got a drawer in the morgue picked out,” Ianto confided. “You distract him with your cleavage, I’ll sneak up from behind and strangle him with jumper cables.” Somewhere in the depths of the chaos, a phone started ringing.
“Well,” Jack said optimistically, “at least he hasn’t disconnected the phone lines.”
~
“Tosh had a rare gift with technology. She...seduced it. Coaxed it. Spoke to it in its own language. Whereas Mickey throws it a mad drunken party in the hopes of getting laid.”
~
Blearily, she grabbed at the mobile and flipped it open. “I hate you so much,” she mumbled, her face still pressed against her pillow.
“Yeah, sorry, you’ll get over it,” Mickey said. “Major Rift spike in your area.”
“I don’t care.”
“About half a block from your flat, actually.”
“I don’t care.”
“Right, so when some seriously pissed off monster from another world starts rampaging through your building—”
“Oh, so you’ve met my husband, then.” There was a chuckle over the line. Rhys, vaguely aware that someone somewhere was insulting him, reached out sleepily to swat her backside. He mostly missed and retreated back into slumber, muttering to himself.
~
“What?” Ianto demanded, folding his arms.
Jack appeared far too amused by Ianto’s disgruntled demeanour. “You look like a man in need of fresh air and daylight.”
“You look like a man in need of a swift punch to the jaw,” Ianto retorted. “Was there anything else, or can I go back to work now?”
“Fresh air,” Jack repeated. “Daylight. Are you coming willingly or will I have to forcibly remove you from the Hub? Jack sighed. “It’s called lunchtime, Ianto. I realize this is a difficult concept, but some people actually like to leave their place of work for a few minutes in the middle of the day, often to consume food and drink.”
Ianto lifted an eyebrow. “You’re certainly one to talk about leaving the workplace. I’m not the person who actually lives here.”
“You might as well. Do you remember what your flat looks like? Because I don’t, and I’m pretty sure I was with you the last time you saw your own bed.”
“Point,” Ianto conceded. He looked at the lift with some longing. Fresh air. Daylight.
~
“I don’t...I’m not sure.” Ianto passed his hand across his face, searching his memory. “There was a flash of light, and my stomach— it felt like being on the wrong end of a Tilt-a-Whirl. I had grabbed his arm, but he shook me off— I was so dizzy, I couldn’t hold onto him. Something hit my head—”
“Yes,” the woman said dryly, looking over at her companion with a scowl. “Something did.”
“How was I supposed to know?” Stephen grumbled, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
~ The sequence came to him; it was just like hacking the Ministry of Defence files, except for the part where it was completely different, but whatever. The mainframe— he privately called her Mildred, the persnickety bitch— made little code rumbles of disapproval, but he ignored her. ~ She yanked away from him, hands on hips, levelling him with a glare. “You! I suppose this is all your fault, isn’t it? Since you burst into my office nattering on about aliens and time travel, all my co-workers have either gone missing or been killed, soldiers in black vans took my family away, I narrowly escaped a car crash, I think I just accidentally-on-purpose killed my former boss, and to top it all off I’ve been dragged against my will to bloody Cardiff, of all the miserable places!” ~
“All right,” Mickey sighed, “now why didn’t either of you bother telling me that days ago, when we found the bloody note in the first place? Wouldn’t have half saved me some trouble, you know.”
“Yes, but that would be logical,” Jack chided, a grin slowly spreading across his face. “What have I told you about using logic?”
Mickey grinned back. “Only on alternate Tuesdays?”
~ “What in the world are you doing here? I thought you hated Earth.” “No ‘hello Turlough, it’s good to see you?’” The man shrugged. “It turns out that I hate Trion more.” Sarah Jane sighed. “Hello, Turlough. It’s good to see you. Please, do come inside.” ~ The sad thing, Clyde thought, was that arriving at Sarah Jane’s house, only to find her fighting off a crowd of giant aliens, with nothing but her sentient supercomputer, her robot dog, and some weird ginger bloke in a school uniform had stopped being strange months ago. Par for the course, really, he thought. ~ “Did I miss anything?” she asked Clyde once she’d caught her breath. “Most of the arguing,” Clyde said easily. “We’re mostly down to plotting now. And snacks. Sarah Jane just sent Luke and Doctor Sullivan out to get more biscuits. Oh, and marshmallows. Peri—she’s the American one, she’s married to this bloke that used to be king on an alien planet—she thought we could have a bonfire and toast them.” Maria blinked. “Used to? What happened to him?” Clyde shrugged. “How should I know? He’s a pro wrestler now, though, a really brilliant one. He even gave me his autograph!” He sounded ridiculously proud of himself.  ~ “That bomb’s probably going to go off if we shoot him with the Tesla, isn’t it?” “Let’s test that theory another day, ok?” ~ “There’s no stopping him when he gets like this. The bylaws for our tree house were eight pages long, and it was an imaginary tree house!” ~ The status of Batman and Talia’s wedding in “Batman: Son of the Demon” is a little complicated, since it was in continuity, then not in continuity, then sort of in continuity when Batman’s son Damian showed up, but the ceremony itself was pretty simple: Ra’s al-Ghul said they were married, Talia said okay, and we moved right along to some crowd-pleasing Shirtless Batman Action. ~ “We’re in Greece, Merlin,” Arthur scolded.  “We’re in Greece on a yacht.  Must you brood so?” ~ “How are you still so pale?” Arthur asked, marvelling. “We’ve been on a cruise in the Mediterranean for a week and a half already.” ~ “You’re the mayor’s disgraceful son, shouldn’t you be off doing something inappropriate for the gossip magazines?” “The hookers and cocaine are arriving at six,” Arthur assures her, and is pleased when the corner of her mouth rises, just a little. ~ Arthur takes a sip; it’s not bad, but it’s not nearly strong enough, and the inadequate coffee adds itself to the list of Things That Are Crap About Arthur’s Life At The Moment. ~ “Feel free to tell her she’s a spoiled hypochondriac and to make her own damn tea,” Arthur suggests, the third time Merlin hurries past.  Merlin laughs. “Yes, because that won’t get me fired at all.”
~
“My life is ridiculous,” Arthur complains, reaching for one of the cookies Merlin has just taken out of the oven and getting his hand slapped for his troubles. “Ow! I could have you fired for that, you know.” “You could,” Merlin agrees, clearly remorseless. “And of course your life is ridiculous, you live it in the public eye and you don’t seem to have any pastimes that don’t result in puking the next morning.”
“If it doesn’t end in puking you’re not doing it right,” Arthur deadpans. Merlin sighs, but he’s grinning anyway. “Right, yeah, how stupid of me to forget that.” Arthur makes another abortive attempt to steal a hot cookie; this time Merlin smacks his hand with a tea towel.  “Fired,” Arthur reminds him. ~ “You don’t love me,” Merlin says patiently. When Arthur opens his mouth to say something in reply – though he has no idea what, his brain has completely ceased functioning – Merlin shakes his head and presses his finger to Arthur’s lips. “No, you really don’t. It’s just that you’ve been starved of love all your life and so you don’t know how to interpret friendship mixed with a little bit of lust.”
~
“...The spare machete?”
Sam looked away, rubbing the back of his neck. “Uh, actually, I brought that.”
Dean smirked. “I thought we weren’t here to hunt,” he mimicked in a voice two octaves higher than Sam’s.
~
“Oh, right,” Sam said, “you’re a perfectly normal human being who just happens to have an irrational fear of holy water. Yeah, I buy that.”
~
“Oh, flaming swords. I had one too, you know,” Aziraphale said petulantly. “Flamed like anything, it did. But I gave—I lost—er, I don’t have it anymore.”
~ “And for the record, Father, I don’t think you smell like elderberries at all.” ~
Morgana doesn’t weigh the same as a duck, but the crowd takes this to mean that if she weighs the same as several ducks, then she must be several times a witch. The problem with trying to weigh several ducks at once is that you can’t. Ducks squawk and flap their wings and generally don’t take too kindly to being jammed into a basket filled with other ducks.
“Can we use something else that weighs the same as a duck?” asks someone in the crowd. “Like maybe two pillows? Or a large encyclopaedia?” Morgana is beginning to wish she really can turn them all into newts. ~
“And you,” she sputters, pointing at Merlin. “You probably made him gay in the first place!” Just behind Sophia, several other people seem entirely too interested in the turn this conversation has taken. Or possibly they’re just waiting to get on the train.  “Yes, I’m a magical gay sorcerer,” Merlin snorts. “I use my magic to make men gay, and we must go before you taint us with your warped heterosexuality.” 
~ When the doors open and they walk in, Arthur is prepared for anything. Except for the bit where Morgana’s lunchtime story apparently acquired a real shotgun. “So, Nimueh shot Valiant,” Arthur sums up succinctly. “Is anyone dead?” Morgana asks. “No, and I think that’s something we have to make very clear in the broadsheets.” “Is anybody maimed?” Morgana presses. “Well, if you don’t count the thirty-odd pieces of buckshot in the backside of the film industry’s leading man, then no.” “So, we’re fine then,” Morgana says dismissively. Arthur eyes Morgana incredulously. “You did hear the part where she shot him, right?” ~ “And robes, and a new cauldron, and Dad says I can have extra books, too, so I can get ahead because it’s good to read as much as you can in early years before there’s too much homework …” Scorpius becomes aware he’s going on, and sees the two grown-ups exchange a look over his head. “Ye-es,” George Weasley agrees in principle. “We did study in Slytherin,” his father is saying to Mr Weasley. “It wasn’t all Dark Arts and goat sacrifices.” ~ Scorpius blinks slowly. “We have the same middle name,” he announces. Al drops into the seat beside him. “Oh, well then we have to be friends,” he declares. ~ The Harry Potter Rule means that first years are allowed to try out for the Quidditch team. The Second Years Are Bigger Rule means that Al and Scorpius spend the first half of the season sitting out the games while their prayers for plagues of stomach bugs to strike down senior members of the team go unanswered. ~ Albus catches Rose’s eye. “If you’re serious about homicide, I’m fine with being an only child,” he tells her. ~ “No pumpkin juice because you’re allergic. I’ve sworn off it in case there’s a terrible case of mixed glasses.” “You’ve sworn off it because it’s not full of sugar and you found out it was healthy.” ~ “Oh that’s it— Lily can have you. I’m finding a new best friend,” Albus exclaims. “Excellent. She’s a girl, that means that at some point there’ll be experimental snogging. I wonder what it’s like.” ~ “Even if you’re pale and bookish,” Lester Biggs, the Slytherin captain teases him. “Pale, bookish, yet wiped your team from the pitch in fifteen minutes,” Scorpius smiles brightly. There are rude hand gestures, but they are made without malice and Biggs waves his Ravenclaw flag as he walks off to find a seat. ~ “Maybe there are certain animals that just appeal to you …” Scorpius manages to stop his eyebrow from moving more than the slightest twitch, but it’s too late. “And, Mr Malfoy, I warn you now that one goat joke will see an end to this class today.”
~
I asked myself, “If this was released by a French film studio, would I have as many problems with it as I do?” The answer was no, so I must hold the French film industry to a lower standard: “They’re French! They don’t know any better!” From now on, I’m just going to assume Stephen Summers is three-quarters French

“I thought Mom just sent you to get more moth balls.”
“Yeah, well, the pantry is getting bare and as much as I enjoy making explosives, you can’t eat the ingredients.”

“He’s got a headache that’s off the scale. He forgets things. He’s tired but can’t really sleep. He’s—” “Hello. He’s right here.” “Yeah, he is,” Charley agreed with a gentle squeeze to John’s kneecap. “Now, is he going to be honest?”

“She sold alien-influenced weapons designs to terrorists.” “To save her mother who was being held hostage. All members of her family are currently present and accounted for, and none of them have any problems that could be used to blackmail them.”

“Did someone call the cops?” Three people held up cell phones in response.

“I know I’m not Daniel, but if you like, I can accidentally drop a few of your favourite, most breakable possessions on occasion,” he offered helpfully. O’Neill looked thoughtful for a moment then shook his head sadly as the elevator opened at their floor. 
“Nah. It’s no fun if it isn’t spontaneous. But thanks anyway.” ~ “I believe Prince Arthur was looking for you a moment ago.” There was a faint hint of disapproval in his tone, as if the prince should not have to resort to looking for his manservant, but there was also an echo of resignation as if he knew Merlin too well by now to hope for any better. ~ Arthur made a distressed sound at the now ripped sheets and held out his arm. “Here,” he said, as if he expected bird-Merlin to follow his orders when human-Merlin hadn’t. Merlin glared, but then reasoned that Arthur’s arm looked a lot steadier than the bed, and Arthur was wearing his leather vambraces which was surprisingly forward-thinking of him.  ~
“Er,” he said, and then something that sounded like “sorrypleasedon’tkillme” and then darted out the door, banging it loudly behind him.
~ This is a very useful spell, Merlin wrote. He formed the letters carefully, small so he could write more later, if he needed to, and did not at all wonder if he was going to get in trouble or be cursed or something for writing in the margins of an ancient spell book. He told the book (in case it had an opinion on the matter), “I am just imparting my knowledge to future generations. I’m sure they will find my comments helpful.” The book made no reply, so Merlin decided it was fine and leaned over the tome again adding, You can clean almost anything with it, even though in this book it refers to badgers alone. Don’t believe that for a second. 
~
Merlin was absently flicking through the pages of his spell book when he found a comment in another hand, written in purple underneath his own reminder; Adjust pronunciation of second L for various colour effects. Merlin, it read in a very familiar and stern manner. Stop defacing this book.  Merlin frowned. “I asked the book,” he told the writing, then upon realising he was talking to writing he sighed. 
~
The book flipped itself open and the pages turned and turned and Merlin thought, Silencing spells, silencing spells and nothing more. He was almost shocked when it actually worked. He pointed to the spell, underlining the title with his finger, then looked at Arthur expectantly. “Someone put this spell on you?” he asked cautiously, reading the page carefully. “Oh right. You can’t agree with that. But I’ll take it that’s what happened.” Arthur turned to Merlin. “So there’s another sorcerer in the castle.” Then under his breath, “As my father suspected.” But then he shook his head. “This doesn’t help us. You still can’t tell me who or what they plan to do, which I presume you know.” Merlin just looked at Arthur, unable to do anything else, and he supposed Arthur must have understood then because he nodded, defeated. “Right.” Merlin tried to think, and in frustration said, “I hate this,” and “I’m sorry,” and grabbed the pen from the table and scribbled a picture of what he hoped looked like Uther (with a big crown and everything) wielding a massive knife murderously. “Oh God,” Arthur groaned. “We’ve resorted to your drawings. Things must be bad.” But he leant over Merlin’s shoulder to look. “Is that what the sorcerer looks like? He has spiky hair?” And if Arthur hadn’t sounded so sincerely curious then Merlin might have hit him. 
~
“I liked the part,” Arthur told Merlin the next day, “Where you were quiet a lot. Can you do that again?” “And I liked the part where you weren’t a complete toss pot. Oh hang on, that never happened.”
~
“Mate. Your name is Arthur? Jesus fucking Christ. I’m Lancelot,” he said, holding his hand out.  “—and I’m Merlin,” he said. “Welcome to training with what will no doubt be known for the next seven months as the Knights of the Round Table. Again. Thanks for that, really. We weren’t doing fine on our own, Lancelot and I, what with the stupid names and the cruel parents and the odd serendipity of our making the Blue boat together last year.”
~
Lancelot had gone to Winchester after that, courtesy of his stepfather, and now he said terribly posh things at the most inappropriate times—If you’ll excuse me, Merlin, I’m terribly afraid I’m about to vomit—as if he’d been born into practiced propriety.
~ He’d coxed a boat full of people who had never rowed before for Christ Church novice regatta, and the experience had been not unlike sitting in a very wobbly blender at low setting. Every rower in the boat seemed to think that his blade should enter the water whenever he saw fit, and people fidgeted on their seats and tilted the boat violently in either direction as Merlin clung valiantly to the sides, glad all coxes were forced to wear a lifejacket. The whole term had been a character-building experience; Merlin had been proud of his boys when they’d rowed the entire course during the novice regatta without their boat causing anyone major bodily harm.
~ “It’s perfectly alright. Your sleep-deprived, suffering sighs provided much entertainment for the rest of us on the way here.” “You’re really a bit of a prat, aren’t you?” asked Merlin, fondly, as if he had known Arthur for years and it was okay for him to say that sort of thing. He felt immensely awkward about it the minute after it had come out of his mouth, but covered it up with a quick, “What are you doing when we get back?” “Trying to sort my thesis out,” said Arthur. “My tutor keeps rabbitting on about how I need to have the idea clearly defined by the end of this week if I’m to have any hope of writing the bloody thing next term while ‘dilly-dallying with my rowing friends’.” Merlin snorted, because it sounded like the sort of thing his own tutor might say. Then he registered what Arthur had said, as slow on the uptake as earlier—Merlin was the sort of individual that required seven hours of sleep a night, or caffeine shot directly into the vein, if he was to function successfully as the day progressed. “Wait. Your thesis? Do you have Finals this year?” “Yes,” said Arthur, as if it made perfect sense. “You have Finals this summer, and you’re doing Blues training at the same time?”  “Yes,” confirmed Arthur, as if he’d had this conversation many times already. “Don’t worry. I’ve been trained to be very productive since birth. My father insisted.” Merlin hmmhed, because ‘my father insisted’ sounded like the sort of thing only viscounts said, and he didn’t want to get into an argument about upper-class indolence—he wasn’t sure it would get much traction, anyway, as they were currently discussing Arthur working harder than most sane people would have considered doing.
~
“Great,” said Merlin, because Lancelot was his closest friend at Oxford, really—it was just trying sometimes, watching him bed man after woman after man only to emerge carefree and (sensitively) triumphant every time. Merlin didn’t think he’d particularly enjoy the experience of Lancelot telling him about having sex with Arthur, either—something which Lancelot would inevitably share, because Lancelot was paralytically unable to process life events without the aid of a second opinion.
~
“This is Morgana’s brother.” “Stepbrother,” said Morgana and Arthur in unison.
~ “Well, that’s ugly,” said Arthur, gesturing to the coat. “Yes; I heard you were coming, and coordinated my outfit to match your face,” said Morgana, eyes on the menu. Arthur’s mouth opened as if he were about to say something, but in the end he seemed unable to think of a quick enough reply, and he sat down next to Morgana, eyebrows drawn together as if he were still trying to think of something scathing to say. ~ “So what’s the thesis going to be about?” asked Morgana distractedly. Morgana asked most things distractedly—she always gave the impression that her conversation with you was not the only thing occupying her brain at the time.
~
“Are you going to look at the poetry in the chronicles, or just the prose annals?” asked Morgana, who was reading Chemistry and had no business knowing anything about Arthur’s History and English dissertation. Morgana was a Postmaster, though, which Merlin had originally thought—for an embarrassingly long time, actually—meant she worked for Royal Mail in the holidays. It turned out it was some awful pretentious name that Merton gave people who were very clever, cleverer than the exhibitioners and scholars that other colleges contented themselves with. In retrospect, Merlin wasn’t really sure how he’d ever thought Morgana worked for Royal Mail, considering that he couldn’t ever picture her dealing with fat beery men trying to post porn to their cousins in Northampton on a Tuesday afternoon, and also that her fur-inclusive wardrobe had always made it very clear that she didn’t have to work part-time for anyone at all. “I’m going to—I’m going to order food,” said Arthur, seemingly unwilling to go head-to-head with his stepsister on a thesis topic she might, for all Merlin knew, turn out to know more about than Arthur. At that precise moment—probably because Arthur had the sort of commanding intonation that travelled across a room and got people to do things when he wanted them to—a man appeared at their table and said, brightly, “What can I get you?”
~
“Anyway, the sports programme at my school was mostly informal, and seemed to involve running away from men with fists bigger than yours more often than not”
~ Merlin contemplated the possibility of asking Arthur and Lancelot back to the Oriel bar for a drink they weren’t supposed to have before tomorrow’s outings, but Lancelot beat him to the punch and said, “Arthur, want to come over and play on the Wii?” Arthur nodded and Lancelot wiggled his eyebrows comically at Merlin, as if expecting Merlin to share his joy at the imminent seduction of Arthur through the ages-old, losing-at-videogames trick.
~
“What are you on about? Earl Grey is clearly the king of teas.” Merlin had sipped his tea, perched on an old rowing boat that was practically decomposing in the corner of the boathouse, trying to communicate that Arthur was missing out on something brilliant and exquisite by making pleased noises as he drank. “Merlin,” Arthur had said, faux-kindly, “I wouldn’t trust you to identify anything of royal calibre if it pointed at you with a bejewelled sceptre, and I’ll have you know that Earl Grey is the direct result of a bergamot-growers’ conspiracy, designed to put all decent Englishmen off their morning cup of tea.”
~
It was Sunday of fifth week when Morgana called, right as Merlin was wandering about aimlessly in Blackwell’s, contemplating whether to buy The Very Short Introduction to Classical Mythology or not. “Morgana?” Merlin asked tentatively, pulling the phone away from his ear to look at the caller ID a second time. “Everything okay?” “Merlin,” she said crisply, “Yes, thank you. How about you?” Merlin had meant, Has Gwen died in a lab explosion? Why are you calling me? but he chose to roll with Morgana’s probably wilful misunderstanding and said, “Yes, fine, thanks. How are you?”
~ “Merlin,” Lancelot answered sensibly, “I think she’ll probably be more furious if you don’t answer the phone.”
~
“What is it, Merlin?” asked Will, inflecting his voice with a tone that suggested an age-old weariness, and Merlin stamped down the urge to derail the conversation—for crying out loud, Will; get over it, already. It’s not as if I came to your house and maimed your mother in the night—in favour of remaining civil enough to convince Will to help him.
~ “Merlin!” she said, sounding absolutely delighted, and Merlin felt a small stone of dread drop into his stomach. His mother was a quiet and dignified woman by nature, and delight was hardly ever a good mood on her. It tended to indicate that something terrible, such as Merlin having to accompany his insufferable cousin Hilda to a school dance at a shabby hotel in Doncaster, was on the horizon. ~
“I’m about two yards away, so I’ll be right there, but—” he lowered his voice. “First of all: what the fuck—That’s the most expensive restaurant in the whole of central Oxford, Arthur. Did something give you the impression that I’d suddenly come into a lot of money?” “No, no, Merlin,” said Arthur, jovially and somewhat artificially, “I was happy to. You know that ever since I found those vouchers for a dinner at Quod in the Oxford Mail, I’ve been waiting for a special occasion to use them.” “Vouchers for Quod in the Oxford Mail, Arthur?” hissed Merlin, aware that his mother must be listening intently if Arthur felt the need to speak with that sort of Wonka-esque inflection, “What—did you find them next to the story about a massive pub brawl in Blackbird Leys? Next to the coupons for Lidl? Plus—no-one at Oxford reads the Oxford Mail, Arthur, and I’m pretty sure even my mother knows that.” “Ha!” said Arthur. “Precisely, precisely—a stroke of good luck that she was visiting the day before they expired.” “Well,” whispered Merlin, “if this is your way of saying that you’ll pay, you aristocratic pratface, that’s very kind of you. But listen, Arthur, speaking of my mother…” “Yes?” asked Arthur, and Merlin pictured him smiling winsomely at Merlin’s mother as he pressed the phone more tightly to his ear, “She just called you lovely twice. And said ‘Well done’ to me. That’s my mother’s subtle code for ‘What a nice boy you’ve found yourself to date, Merlin’.” “Oh yes,” said Arthur. “Yes, I’d gathered that much. Never mind, never mind—it’s not a problem. See you in a couple of minutes then!” Merlin heard a faint voice say, “Well, Hunith, as I was saying…” before Arthur disconnected the call. […] Dinner turned out to be far more pleasant than Merlin had expected—Arthur’s parent-meeting behaviour, so strange-sounding on the phone, was, unsurprisingly, very charming in person. Merlin’s mum continued to seem delighted with him—every few minutes, she would shoot Merlin a significant look, and Merlin would smile and try to look less uncomfortable than he felt. “Arthur,” she said, looking disapprovingly at Merlin, “how long have you and Merlin known each other?” “We met at the beginning of this year, Hunith,” said Arthur, using his fish knife to pull back the skin of his haddock perfectly. Merlin had made a bit of a hash of it already and was certain he’d be choking on a fish bone sooner rather than later. Arthur had done a brilliant job of deflecting each of Merlin’s mother’s difficult questions so far, saying things like, “Oh, yes—Merlin is a very good cox,” to his mum’s, “And are you happy, Arthur—together?” ~ Arthur had looked at her strangely before saying, “We never say that.” “No,” conceded Morgana, “but we could.” ~ Lancelot could drink like a fish and had been designated pub-crawl director, which Merlin had thought was an iffy decision as soon as Morgana had announced it. Lancelot’s choice of dodgy pubs had seemed to confirm this, at first, but now they were drinking next to Sainsbury’s at a place that seemed to have its quiz machine set to ‘Ludicrously Easy,’ and Merlin had cheered up considerably after he consistently began winning £2 for every 50p he put in. ~ “You’d like being a sword again,” Merlin told it with slightly more urgency. Behind him, he could hear Arthur frantically stamping fire from his bear rug. He winced. Arthur loved that rug. It had been his first trophy. Aged three, he’d toddled alone into a mirk and deadly wood, and killed the beast with his bare hands and then skinned it with only his teeth and the righteous glow of his pure heart, or whatever. Merlin looked over his shoulder. “I’m not sure it wants to change back.” Arthur looked at him. There was a singed hole in the rug. It was surprisingly big considering the size of the fireball. Arthur’s expression was as injured as if the hole were in his leg. “Ah,” Merlin said. “I can—” probably “—I can fix that.” Arthur raised his eyebrows. “Or possibly slay an identical extremely large bear for you?” Except, he quite liked bears. Especially from afar. “Or maybe we could find a table to cover it up. I think there’s a nice one in Morg—” “Merlin!” “Um. Should I— perhaps I’ll concentrate on the sword first, yeah?” “Please,” Arthur said. “Because I’m not about to ask Gwen for a spare sword to slay my sword.” ~
“I told you, Sirius, I’m not going to help you. I’m—” Remus began.
“An adult? Responsible? Not holding a decade-long grudge?” Harry supplied helpfully.
“Yes. To all of those things,” Remus agreed.
Sirius shot them a withering look. “Oh shut up. Now, since we last met that git did conspire to turn me into a Veela. Fortunately, the effect wore off at 48 hours because most of my new fangirls were underage. In return, I may have turned his nose into a beak and enchanted every reflective surface he came across to give him hygiene tips. This was all very good but now there is a new week, so we need a new plan!” Sirius waited for a moment, but Harry and Remus stayed silent. “Well?”
“You told us to shut up,” Remus said mildly as Harry tried to see if he could read Remus’s paperwork upside-down.
“I didn’t actually expect you to listen,” Sirius said impatiently. “So…ideas?”
“You could decorate his classroom with pictures of yourself in drag,” Harry muttered.
“I don’t quite think that would have the desired effect,” Sirius said, writing it down anyway. “Remus?”
“You could try acting like a responsible member of society and not reviving this petty rivalry,” Remus suggested.
Sirius just stared at him. “Wow. You are REALLY bad at this. I’m never leaving you alone for twelve years again.”
“Whatever makes you happy, Sirius,” Remus said serenely.
“That’s a good philosophy,” Sirius smiled. “I think more people should adopt it.”

“What do we need to do the summoning?” Logan asks, moving toward the emergency supplies. “I think we’ve got more or—”
“Cas!” Dean howls, throwing his head back. “You son of a bitch. We had this talk, you’re supposed to freaking warn me before you bust out the DeLoreans.” Logan is pretty sure that is not how you are supposed to go about summoning an angel.
~
A blush creeps up Logan’s neck. “Max and I have logistical issues.”
“If you need the talk…” Dean leers.
“If Max and I touch, I’m going to die. She was infected with a genetically altered retrovirus specifically targeted to my DNA.”
Dean snorts. “Never mind. That kind of talk is not in my repertoire.”
~ “When we go out on cases, you never ask to come with me when I’m seeing a client by myself. But when Divya is scheduled to see a client by herself, you usually end up going with her.”
Evan went perfectly still, mentally reviewing recent history for the evidence he’d need to prove Hank wrong. It was a distinctly uncomfortable sensation to realize there wasn’t any, which clearly meant that the only other option was to bluff. “If you want, there’s probably enough room in the budget to hire a girl to follow you around.” He paused theatrically. “Or a guy. I’m not judgmental.”
~
A cry of “Constant vigilance!” accompanied the Stinging Hex. Severus gritted his teeth and pushed himself to his feet. “Alastor, I will murder you in your sleep.”
~
The glare was obviously directed mostly at Severus, and without thinking, Severus took up the same posture in return. Albus looked back and forth between the two for a moment and then smiled. “Ah. I see we’re all on the same page.”
~
Either the universe would explode from so much pocket-sized badassery in one place, or they’d become immediate best friends; I wasn’t sure which potential outcome scared me more.
~ Clark swore again slightly more extensively.
“I have no idea what you just said, but I think I agree,” Henderson said darkly.
~
“He’s an ass and a whiner. You know,” and here Jim could swear his CMO looks almost wistful, “time was you and I taped people like that to the Academy flagpole with duct tape. Naked.”
~ Tomorrow morning, and indeed for just about the rest of his life, Jim will not be able to remember how he went from ‘clerical error with the assignment of the leaving slots’ to ‘play or stay, Kirk!’, i.e. a table full of Starfleet captains, a rather intoxicated Commander Whither, and a game of Texas hold ‘em. It’s karma. Obviously. Very very bad karma. Probably the other Kirk’s fault. Yet another thing to ask The Ambassador about. Jim draws up a chair, gets dealt in, and proceeds to whup all of their asses, because he’s Jim Kirk and that’s what he does. He refuses the subsequent offers of wine, women and song in order to stagger back to his girl as fast as he can while carrying the following: one mysterious, rather ancient looking wooden chest with a rusted padlock hanging off it, a data chip holding three hundred back issues of Empire film magazine starting about a hundred years ago, a baseball bat, a leather jacket, and written confirmation that they do, in fact, have the leaving slot tomorrow afternoon at thirteen-hundred, standard Terran timekeeping.
~ No matter how many pictures Dean has of Sam sleeping on the passenger seat with various utensils poking out of his mouth and nose, it will never compare to the single faded photograph of Dean as a hotdog, replete with red-stockinged legs. What makes it better is Sam was running when he took the picture because Dean had spotted him across the street and the photo is of an angry hotdog in pursuit.
~ “You know, we’re objectifying him as a sexual object,” some last smidgen of conscience prompted her to say. “I’m sure trying,” Joy muttered.
~ He smelled like Old Spice and gunpowder. J.J. wished she was the kind of person who propositioned strippers. When Elsie and Joy squeaked and the stripper started laughing, she realized she’d said it out loud.
~
“I wasn’t going to call you out here, but Binky insisted.” He took in their blank looks. “You don’t call him Binky?”
“We do now,” Shawn said with a pleased smirk.
~
“Cell phones won’t work out here. We’ve got no TVs, no radios, no refrigerators.”
“Sounds like prison, except they have all those things.”
~
“It was a simpler time, when people weren’t so preoccupied by the distractions of modern life.”
“Like living past age forty?”
~
“You don’t use psychologically relevant words like transference. Have you been hanging out with Mom?”
“We may or may not have dined together last week…but my point still stands.”
~
“I assume by the intensity of your attention that I do not have beer foam upon my face,” Spock says, “but I confess to being at a loss as to another possible cause for staring.” His curiosity is so mild it doesn’t interfere with further drinking of his beer.
~
“Really?” Jim shoots back, partly because he actually finds it odd, partly just because it’s a conversational habit, and not actually at all to see the muscle under Spock’s eyebrow tick up in annoyance, though he knows it’s going to, because why would I say so if it were not true?
~ Jim tells the story of their jump onto the drill, making Sulu sound at least six times a wittier badass than anyone actually has time to be in a situation like that, and managing to stretch the telling of himself hanging by his fingernails almost as long as it actually felt at the time.
~
When Star Trek was first pitched to NBC, the station felt that the character of Spock looked like the devil. Which is ridicul— actually we can kind of see where they’re coming from. And now we can’t unsee it.
~ When a rebellion in Cuba against the Spanish started brewing, Hearst and Pulitzer saw a golden opportunity; they’d report on the situation in Cuba to sell papers, and if the situation wasn’t interesting, they’d make shit up because journalism is easy when you don’t have a soul.
~ Sometimes on reality shows, they’re not even sure if they’re on a show with prizes, or what the prize is–they will debase themselves and taunt their own god to win. For proof, three different groups of women have competed to let Flavour Flav inside them, and he looks like something that crawls out of bogs to replace our babies with changelings.
~ You should know by now sugar gives you a quick burst of energy followed by a big downer, and if we need to explain the effect of caffeine then we’d first like to welcome you to the 19th century. Please, hang up your tweed pantaloons as we explain this thing called electricity.
~
For an organization that once tried to conquer the world through mind-control chewing gum, this is actually not a bad plan.
~ Undoubtedly inspired by a pair of suicides attributed to Satanic Messages on Judas Priest’s Screaming For Vengeance, Cobra Commander slapped some glam-rock wigs on Zartan and the Dreadnoks and produced his own hypnotic single. Unfortunately, Cold Slither (with their #1 hit “Cold Slither” from the album Cold Slither) only made it as far as the State Fair before the plot was uncovered by G. I. Joe, most likely because they forgot to make the messages subliminal and instead put lines like, “Do not resist, ‘cause Cobra is strong” right there in the actual song.
~ We agree that at first glance this plan sounds fucking awesome, but Destro shouldn’t have had realistic hopes for its successful implementation seeing as how every member of the elite G. I. Joe team is armed with a flame-throwing laser bazooka.
~ D’Alleva was reborn as Cesspool, and teamed up with Cobra Commander in his quest to make the earth as ugly and scarred as he is. We’re not sure we can follow his logic of joining forces with the person responsible for his disfigurement to wreak havoc on a nebulous target that had absolutely no involvement in his tragedy, but we’re pretty sure that was also Two-Face’s motivation in The Dark Knight so we’ll let it slide.
~ While Destro is descended from a long line of mercenaries and weapons suppliers based in Scotland, Darklon hails from a long line of mercenaries and weapons suppliers based in the kingdom of Darklonia, a nebulous Eastern Bloc nation sharing its borders with Borovia and Madeupbullshitistan. Also, Darklon wears a green fishnet shirt, which presumably is a hand-me-down from Destro that stokes the fires of his resentment.
~
It should be noted that Viper, despite being armed with a weapon that can fire 1,000 rounds per minute, somehow only managed to kill four people before he was overpowered (presumably he asked those four if they would please stand very close together before he opened fire). Tagline: “You won’t even know I’ve shot at you until you hear the sonic boom from the bullet whipping past your ear!” Yep. You won’t know he’s shooting at you until he fucking misses.
~
Nosecone could transform into a Cybertronian drill-tank. You may notice that “cybertronian” and “drill-tank” aren’t Earth words, in which case well done, you’re twice as good at disguise as Nosecone was. He had a tendency to “hide” by simply drilling underground, which you’ll notice isn’t technically camouflage, thereby altering famous Transformers “Robots In Disguise!” tagline to the simpler and lamer “Robots Somewhere Else!” 
~ Sky Lynx: plastic-moulded proof that while it’s OK for Renaissance artists to use drugs for inspiration, toymakers should steer clear. He looks like a Space Shuttle that got pissed on absinthe and stumbled into a Mythical Greek orgy, on top of a nuclear reactor. His only possible camouflage option is passers-by refusing to believe what they just saw. You might ask “How can something turn into a space shuttle, an animal beast and a bird?” The only answer (apart from the counter-question “Why would you want to be a goddamn bird when you’re already a space shuttle?”) is to say “Space Shuttle, no problem, and a mumblemumble, got it.” To say that Sky Lynx’s other modes look like anything at all would be a horribly generous overstatement. In fact, Sky Lynx doesn’t even have a robot mode, meaning he’s the only Transformer EVER to fuck up both parts of “Robots in Disguise.”
~ “Do you know the ramifications your hybridization could have on the evolutionary process in just a few generations?” “People might start getting stronger, faster, and flying. The horror,” Lois said dryly. “The horror.” Batman crossed his arms. “Laugh while you can, but when a cross-species pandemic is wiping out planet Earth, don’t come running to me, because I’ll be long-dead. Or in cryogenic suspension. It’s a contingency plan.”
~ Tony froze. He really wasn’t cut out to deal with this sort of situation. He tried to think of what people did in movies, and he awkwardly patted her on the back.
~
“Oh, fine. ‘Pavel, find out what makes him tick.’ No problem, there. I can do that.” He starts surreptitiously following Spock, until Spock reveals that, in fact, he hasn’t been in the least surreptitious, and Chekhov is left stammering in a corridor frantically trying to come up with a reason for following him around.
~
They have a giant row in the Medical Bay (at which point McCoy, who says he hasn’t seen anything like it since the last time he shared a room with his ex, puts his credits down on ‘No, never, not a damn chance’), but then are caught making out on the security vids by Lt Lewis (who swears he doesn’t use the vids to spy on people; a claim no-one believes).
~
Better to be perpetually annoyed at her father than miss him too much, was Lois’ philosophy.
~
“But Jan’s always right,” Michael says pathetically. “That’s the first thing you learn about dating Jan.”
~ “It’s not the shampoo, Sam.” “How do you know?” “Because it’s shampoo? Not exactly an agent of evil!” “People are bowing at me! Uncontrollably!”
“And we’ll find out why and fix it, but, come on. Shampoo?” Sam sighed and shifted in his seat, staring out the window. “At least pull off at the rest stop so I can rinse my hair?”
~
“I’m going to pull this out and it’s gonna hurt,” he doesn’t wait to get the words out, just takes a deep breath between ‘gonna’ and ‘hurt’ and yanks. 
~ A puzzled Rhode appeared in her office the next day at 11:45 a.m. He stared at his cell phone and said, “I’m supposed to take you out to lunch today. Sushi. Someplace that serves sea urchin.”
~ After much gavelling—and he rally needed to get one of those—and admonishments and scolding about “appropriate language”—because if you swore, then by God the broadcast networks couldn’t use the choice bits and wouldn’t that be a shame—the prosecutor again turned to him. Law & Order had this totally wrong. A trial was fun. It was a golden opportunity to mess with the heads of the maximum number of people with the minimum amount of effort.
~
“Define a drug,” Logan said simply, smirking. Good old Bill Clinton. Such a wonderful role model. Logan was pleased he could put these valuable lessons to good use. “Fine then. Did you buy any substance that the DEA currently lists as controlled in the United States but is readily available in Mexico?”
~
“No? Never? Not once?” “That’s generally the accepted definition of ‘no.’”
~ He’d asked once, after being given no supper for some wrong or other he’d done— possibly he’d enjoyed something on a Sunday, or else talked to a girl— how he was supposed to know all these things, to which his uncle had said, in a rather weary tone, that he might try reading his Bible. Jack investigated his uncle’s Bible, in hopes that it contained some sort of list, but it was the same Bible he’d already read (and had indeed learned a great deal of vocabulary from, in the process of puzzling out words like “lamentations” and “foreskin.”)
~ He’d more or less got the hang of not taking the name of the Lord in vain, and remembering the Sabbath seemed easy enough, too, as it was the day of the week on which you weren’t supposed to have any fun.
~ “It’s just a temporary assignment. He’ll go to Hell eventually.” Michael frowned at him. “And you said I’d go to Heaven. I died in 657 A.D., Mike, and I’m still waitin’. So I’m not bloody worried about it for a while.”
~ Tony raised his eyebrows and bent forward cupping his ear. “I’m sorry? I don’t think I heard an answer there. Please do keep in mind any further sarcasm will be taken as an affirmative and we may have to start picking out china patterns. Something traditional and no flowers.”
“Tony,” Pepper said putting her Blackberry away. “I really don’t think that using the excuse of moral ambiguity is a basis for a marriage.”
~ “I’ll give you twenty bucks if you make sure he doesn’t get any alcohol,” he says, pointing at Dean. The last thing he needed was for his injured brother to get drunk and pick a fight to prove he wasn’t a sissy who got taken out by a unicorn.
~
“Because that’s my assignment.”
“Is that military idiot for, ‘don’t know, don’t care’?”
494 sat up fully and swung his legs over the side of the bed. “Are you always this obnoxious?”
“Look, I’m the one being kidnapped.”
494 paused. “Fair enough.”
~ They’re about three months into their shakedown cruise when Spock folds himself onto the bench beside her at dinner and asks, his voice perfectly level in the way that she’s learned means he’s terribly nervous, if she would be interested in learning to play the Vulcan lute.
~ Spock tells him about the incredibly awkward, illogical conversation he had with Nyota when it dawned on him that she thinks their relationship is something different than what Spock believed it to be. His other self sympathizes and suggests some music she might like, as a I’m Sorry I’m A Vulcan and Didn’t Realize You Had An Emotional Attachment To Me present. Humans like receiving presents.
~
“Not a girl? You could have fooled me,” she says, putting in the DVD. “I’m pretty sure your hair is long enough to braid now.” “It is not,” says Sam, but he looks kind of worried that it might be.
~ Humans would’ve named the planet New Earth and the places things like New Africa or New Russia. Vulcans did no such thing; they named the planet Vik: the well in the desert. They named the continents Ashv’cezh, Laktra, and Vrekasht: Revenge, Grief, and Outcast.
~ She simultaneously flinched and relaxed. “How would you be doing, in his place?” “I’d be recklessly destroying government property in an effort to prove my manliness.” “So, what you do anyway.” He shook his head and grinned at her, rueful. “And I’d be having screaming nightmares while simultaneously denying I needed any help.” He searched her face. “Unless I had someone who knew me too well to let me get away with that.”
~ “I am half-human,” Kirk heard him say, with the mismatch of mouth and voice that meant Spock was speaking Vulcan; bless universal translators.
~ “Woman trouble, or Vulcan trouble?”
“Why must it be either of those options?” “Because I’m your CO, and I know it’s not professional trouble. That leaves only woman trouble, or Vulcan trouble.”
~ “To call your mom,” Lois supplied, running her hand along Clark’s forearm. “About leaving us a key.” They held each other’s gaze.
“Right!” Clark agreed without missing a beat. “Yes. Everything’s fine, thank you.”
~
“Do me a favour? Next time I go running off because there’s a chemical spillage at a cosmetics factory, just stop me.”
She patted the top of his hand affectionately, “Will do, honey.”
“Five helicopters, two hazmat teams, thirty-six metric tons of iodine solution forming an entirely new compound with a vat of surgical lubricant, and all of it,” he searched for the right word, “...seeping into three stories of underground storage compartments.” He looked a little haunted, “I took a shower but the suit is a mess.”
~ Clark hitched Jason to a more comfortable position, “We want this one back before he turns into a pumpkin.” There was a muffled noise of protest from Jason nominally meant to convey that he was wide-awake and ready to party, but he ended his interruption by puttering weakly into his father’s shoulder.
~ “She’s pretty, she’s kind, she’s good with animals and small children—” it took Clark by surprise that Lois looked a little hurt, “even Jason likes her. She bakes.” Exasperation collared Lois’s tone as she fluttered a hand, “She makes homemade sarsaparilla.” Lois shifted, “She’s everything I’m not.” He frowned. “But mostly, Clark? Mostly?” She faced him, “I think it’s the look of undisguised, unadulterated lust she directs at you every time you’re in a room together.” He opened his mouth, wanting to argue the point—but, honestly, there was no foundation for doing so. “She has absolutely no sense of the sisterhood,” Lois continued. “I think it’s because she was prom queen.” Her fingers waggled in the air, “I have a theory that it fosters an unhealthy superiority complex over other women.”
Reasonably, Clark said, “She was never prom queen, Lois.”
“Head cheerleader, then.”
“She was never that, either.”
She gave a shrug of whatever, squinting, “Class president? Voted ‘Comeliest Smile’. Will you allow me my unfounded prejudices, please?”
~ Quietly, seriously, Lois asked, “What about the homemade sarsaparilla? Wouldn’t you like it if I…did that kind of stuff?”
“Made homemade sarsaparilla?”
“Jams, breads,” Lois offered, eyes twinkling, “pastries?”
After a series of blinks, Clark rolled his lips. “I’m not sure what part of our domestic life could possibly be improved upon by either one of us making jams.”
~ James grinned and adjusted his glasses, which he’d transfigured into goggles for the occasion, admittedly more for style than protection. “Your objections have been duly noted for the record, Mr Moony.” “I told you, the theory is perfectly sound.” Sirius still sounded annoyed. He’d unaccountably scorned all of James’ enthusiasms about Muggle-style pilot headgear, and had instead transfigured his robes into a sort of leather shirt thing, which had made Remus raise a single eyebrow and Peter fall about laughing.
~
“Ave Caesar! Morituri te salutant,” he said, because he was one of those lunatics who thought Latin was an actual language. James had never seen the point. If you wanted to do something, you just did it, and the wandwork mattered far more than the declension. “Don’t be an idiot, Moony, that’s our line. You’re obviously Caesar,” Sirius said, because he had been born into an entire family of lunatics and had studied dusty grammars since the age of three.
~
James flipped some of the levers, which were not entirely gratuitous, and the dashboard flickered to life under his hands.
~
Sirius had held out for flame throwers, pointing out quite logically that they couldn’t claim to be building a Spitfire unless it was actually capable of spitting fire, but Remus had put his foot down about that one and James had reluctantly concurred. So the aeroplane fired spit balls instead.
~ “Divesto!” she snapped, flicking her wand out sharply, and James did not need Peter’s muffled squeak of dismay to know that they were now completely, horribly, noticeable.
~ “No, that’s what it says,” Georgiana concluded after a more careful examination of the sign. “ Mouseio tis Laspis , that definitely means Museum of Mud.”
~ He felt a wave of fondness for all the people here— even the sticky baby that was, unimpressed by the stage decorations, instead concentrating very hard on unbuttoning his trouser pocket. (This was by way of being a difficult task; the baby hadn’t quite sorted out the complexities of its fingers, yet, and was still at a complete loss about this whole thumb issue. Still, it was a shiny brass button and the baby had all night.)
~ It was smoother than it should have been—Crowley’s willpower was doing the work of an advanced suspension system. They left a wake of baffled potholes and thwarted bumps behind them as they went.
~
“No? I was just thinking... it needs things. The soul needs and the body needs. The soul needs absolution and resolution and justice. But sometimes the body just needs a hug, before you can get round to any of the rest of it.” “Angel, I ask only out of curiosity, have you gone insane?”
~
Jim was easily cleared from the list—he was as indestructible and inexhaustible as ever, and if he did show any signs of damage later on, he would inevitably be surrounded by people who could rush him in for help. Spock accepted a scan with equanimity, of course; it was only goddamned logical to ascertain the state of his health.
~ “We spend our days breaking every other law we run across, fighting hellbeasts with our bare hands and you’re worried about a tax audit?”
“Well some of us don’t have the advantage of being legally dead in most states. They’re never going to go after you.” “And if they do, I’ve got a silver bullet, a few stakes, and a metric assload of rock salt to defend myself with. They can’t be any worse than those rabid werewolves in Tampa. We’ll be fine.” 
~ “Actually,” Linus said, “it was more of a light mauve.”
“Doesn’t matter.”
“Well it sort of does. I mean light mauve has more blue than regular mauve or pink would.”
~
The sip she takes may be more like gulp, and it’s certainly half of whatever he had poured her and he thinks maybe he should start to worry. “Save yourself a return trip,” she calls out, “and make it a double. “ He skips the bar completely, and heads to the sink.
~ When Rose, clothed in a dressing gown and a glare, opened the door for him at half past two in the morning, he fell over the threshold in an undignified heap at her feet. “Think ‘m drunk,” he slurred, hypothesizing that if the room would just stop spinning for a bit, he could stand up and speak to her face to face. “Do you think?” Rose said as she helped him to his feet. “You can’t fool me, you’re being sarcastic. I know what sarcasm sounds like, you know. I’m very clever.”
~
“What do you mean we fell in the pool?” His memory seems to stop somewhere around drinking Sammy under the table, able to take a couple of steps back from that to winning big and finding last motel room in Vegas, sans mod cons including cable and pool.
“Pond,” Sam amends. “Garden feature. Thing.”
“Jesus.” So that’s why his mouth tastes like piss and cigarettes. Nausea rears its ugly head.
~ He excised ‘y’all’ forcibly from his vocabulary and replaced it with words like ‘excised’.
~ He drives a good twenty minutes before he finds what he’s looking for, a place where the paint is peeling, the neon sign is flickering, and where, by God, even the floor is covered in grease.
~ You get a grid of letters. You swipe your finger over them in any direction. When you make a word, you get points, and it makes a little chime, and your brain secrets a little droplet of pure natural heroin. You feel happy. Then the feeling goes away, and you swipe some more. You have two minutes to make as many words as you can. When two minutes are up, you learn whether or not your life has any purpose, depending on whether or not you notched a new high score. Then the little orange letters rearrange themselves excitedly— it’s a real graphical masterpiece— as if they can’t wait to be spelled on again. You can’t wait either.
~ A truly 3D movie would be one where the 3D was so integral to the storytelling and the visuals and the experience that seeing it in 2D would be like seeing a giant-robots-throwing-buildings-at-each-other blockbuster as a flipbook while a hyperactive eight-year-old supplied the sound effects by shouting “BANG!” and “CRASH!” in your ear.
~
“Watch out for this one; he eats blondes like you for breakfast.”
“Actually, I’m taking a break from girls. Consider me on a diet.”
“Are you calling me fat?”
“I didn’t mean it like—look, I was just…maybe we should just go.”
“That’s probably best. Any more drinks you order from me are going to have an additional mucous based ingredient.”
~
“No offence, dude, but you’re starting to sound like a stalker.”
“Well, then I’m the worst stalker in the world because I can’t even find the person I’m trying to stalk.”
“I think it’s your sideburns. The bigger they get the more neurotic you become.”
“I don’t know what to do, Martin. It’s hopeless.”
“Aw, no it isn’t. They still haven’t completely devoured your face. We have time to get you to a barber.”
“Was I this helpful when you were single?”
“Yeah, as I recall you spent a lot of time pointing at me going ‘ha ha’.”
~
“You could just wander around town hoping to bump into her. If she lives around here, it’s inevitable.”
“That could take days! I don’t have enough vacation time left this year for that.”
~
“What’s the biggest cup of coffee you can legally sell me? A bucket? A trough?”
“We can sell you a keg of espresso, but you have to sign a waiver.”
~
“That wasn’t a G Major. I’m not even sure there was a letter for what you just played.”
“That was awesome! My guitar doesn’t gently weep, it screeches profanity.”
~
“Your great-grandfather Thaddeus Whitehall Chatham spent twenty years in the African bush. Civilizing the uncultured savage runs in the Chatham blood.”
“And now those poor Africans have twenty words in their language for ‘pompous, condescending white man’.”
~
“Bartender, two glasses of your finest whiskey.”
“Um, we don’t really serve anything I’d describe as ‘finest whiskey’.”
“Alright then, your foulest rotgut!”
~
“It’s a guitar. A rather ugly guitar, in fact.”
“No, it’s a 1970s Gibson SG. The holy grail of underappreciated rock guitars.”
“Forgive me for failing to see the shiny halo or hear the choir of angels singing hallelujah.”
“You’re really missing out. The lead angel is playing a bitchin’ saxophone solo right now.”
~
“Hey, I think the comparison’s pretty apt. Christ walked on water, and I can walk on water beds. Christ was crucified, and I hang out with you sometimes.”
“How’d you like some stigmata? I have a Phillips-head screwdriver and a hammer in my bedroom.”
~
“This is not exactly what I had in mind when I said make-up. Also, exactly what kind of website did you get this look from anyway?”
“There’s a lady and there’s another lady, and sometimes she brings her  friend too. It would cost me $4.99 a month to find out more.”
~
“Oh man, are we talking firing squad at dawn? Pit of tiger sharks? Mute Japanese assassins slipping scorpions into your bed at night?”
“No, she’d just fire the accountant…out of a cannon…into a volcano.”
“Your mom should write a book: “Everything I Needed to Know about Management I Learned from James Bond Movies.”
~
“So, is this guy going to jail? I mean, you caught him—what? Why aren’t you reporting it? He stole, like, six million dollars…No, mother, don’t you dare!...I don’t care if that’s what you bought the shark tank for. It’s morally wrong…No, we can’t ‘compromise. Don’t you think it’ll look a little suspicious if you hand him over to the FBI and he’s covered in eel bites…What do they eat? I don’t know. Probably just fish. What kind of sharks are they anyway? Whale sharks? Mother, whale sharks only eat tiny things. Plankton and krill and stuff…No, you cannot just ‘run him through a wood chipper first’.”
~
“Well, there’s your problem. Why the heck do people still use machines that can’t think?”
“Winslow, don’t be racist. Non-sentient machines can still lead perfectly productive lives in modern society. In fact, a lot of things are better off non-sentient. Can you imagine the kind of counselling self-aware nuclear weapons would need?”
~
“Are you getting flashbacks to your first date too?”
“Not quite. If Winslow catches his shirt on fire and Hannah starts crying, then the déjà vu will kick in.”
~
“How come he gets a human body and I don’t?”
“Because if you had opposable thumbs you’d be a threat to civilization.”
“That’s not fair. Monkeys have opposable thumbs and they’re not a threat to civilization.”
“I don’t know…monkeys always look like they know something we don’t.”
“Yeah, the taste of their own urine.”
“Actually, some people on the internet—”
“I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know!”
~
“I’m not really supposed to tell you, but that handshake is man-code for ‘yes, I am sleeping with your daughter.’ The wrist grab means ‘we are using protection.’ The last part where he grabbed my thumb indicates his tentative approval. If he hadn’t approved, I’d have a broken thumb. It’s a very unambiguous system.”
~
“It was only supposed to play the ‘Happy Birthday’ song and display a holographic cake.”
“Yeah, I was gonna do that , but then I thought ‘how many people get to avert global thermonuclear war for their birthday?’”
~
“Hannah, you don’t have morning sickness. You have to have sex with someone before you can get pregnant.”
“Not necessarily. What if someone snuck into my room one night and inseminated me?”
“Why on earth would anyone want to do that?”
“Why wouldn’t they? Clone babies. Black-market organs. Secret, genetically engineered super soldiers!
“I don’t even know where to begin…I have some tranquilizers in my room.”
“No, they’ll hurt my psychic clone-baby.”
~
“She hasn’t taken those guitar lessons yet. She’s really more of a …sonic texturalist than a guitar player per se. Imagine a mountain lion trapped in a box full of barbed wire and broken glass. Now throw that box down some stairs…”
~
“Bring in more business, eh? I know! We could do a car wash. Or a wet T-shirt contest. Or a swimsuit calendar.”
“How delightfully exploitative. While we’re at it, why don’t we try blowing our male customers for fifty bucks a pop?”
“Oh, so Dora told you about Plan Omega?”
“You better be fucking with me.”
“No, that’s Plan Zeta. That comes before Plan Omega. They’re ranked by risk of STD exposure.”
~
“Baking isn’t hard. You follow instructions and if you get them right, food happens. If you get them wrong there’s shame and recrimination, made that much worse by lack of cookies.”
~
“I guess it’s just you and me in the awkward zone. You know, where you’re hanging out alone with a dude you don’t know super well yet, and you don’t know how to break the ice.”
“Then we must endeavour to find some common ground. I posit that ladies’ bosoms are rad. Do you agree?”
“Why, as a matter of fact, I do! Who would have guessed it?”

“Just tell them you were baptized.” “Yes, and then I got confirmed, and then I stopped going because I thought the Bible was nonsense, no one seemed to give a shit about behaving in a Christ-like manner towards their fellow man anymore, and I didn’t want to be a part of something I saw in large part as being too fixated on promoting sexism, racism, intolerance of other religions and homophobia.”

Librarians have a degree in library science. Help them make sure it doesn’t gather dust. The words “I need to do research on X. Can you help me?” will magically fill your hands with books. Also, typing X For The Complete Idiot into a search bar will usually bring up at least one site geared toward people with the IQ of a geranium, which is a 10 minute crash course for the rest of us. It’s how I learned HTML.
~ My morning has consisted of lying in a foetal position, eating a whole tub of Ben and jerry’s, talking to my cat, and setting all of our pictures on fire. Does that answer your question?

“Why does everyone think that all I do is drink? I go to class on Wednesdays.”

After he passed out we removed everything electronic from his room, stuck in some old books and an ancient typewriter from goodwill. For 20 minutes we had him convinced he’d drunk himself backward in time.

He’s wearing faded jeans, a flannel shirt, and a tan jacket and seems to be well-versed in the John Sheppard School of looking bored and obtuse but he isn’t fooling Rodney any more than Sheppard could. Rodney can tell the damn kid is READING one of his astrophysics papers upside down. He also, judging by the black eye, is schooled in the John Sheppard School of combat – the one that teaches you to appear to be losing until the very last minute.

SG-8 had brought back some animal that looked remarkably like earth’s innocent bunny rabbit only with some rather violent tendencies. The zoologists, distracted by too many Monty Python jokes, had accidentally let it escape and when it encountered the timid rabbits of earth had started creating in them similar homicidal tendencies.

“I promised Chloe. She didn’t seem to think I’d give her little experiment a fair shot, so she made me promise to see every date through, unless an actual genuine emergency came up. And she would get to decide if something was an emergency or not.” After a brief pause, she shook her head. “Damn it. I should have set the restaurant on fire. Why didn’t I think of that sooner?”
“Arson charges?” Clark offered with a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
~ “Much as I’m enjoying this bonding, you should go shower.”
“Exactly what are you insinuating?”
“Who’s insinuating? You stink.” Bones lets out a snort of surprised laughter. Jim closes his eyes as his lips curl upwards. “What? I think we’re close enough to be honest.”

“You were pretty sure? I’m not sure how comfortable I am relying on your ‘pretty sure’, Owen.”
“Hey!” he objected, pointing at his chest. “Doctorate. Medical researcher. And also, it was Tosh’s idea.”
~
“Yes, sir. If by ‘kidnap’ you mean offer me a job with better wages, better benefits, and a considerably reduced chance of violent death.”
Jack paused for a minute. “We have benefits!”
“The promise of taking care of funeral costs doesn’t mean a lot when it amounts to archival in the morgue, sir. Our medical care is Owen swearing about the manifest stupidity in not ducking to avoid being hit with alien acid. Vacation pay would be impressive if we weren’t on call every day. And as for severance packages…Retcon and a nice whiskey does not qualify as ‘recompense for dedicated service, commensurate with length of employment’.”
~
But he smiled back anyway, and took the correct appendage to wish them a safe journey home. The others were still grinning at him when he walked over to explain why, exactly, you should wait for the other person to stick out the proper hand.
~ Just to restate: this is A LOT OF FREAKING FOOD. The Food Network site claims this will make four servings, which might be true if you live in a family of insatiable giants. In my phenomenally humble opinion, it’ll serve a minimum of six, especially if you include garlic bread or a salad or something. (Things to Ponder: Can one claim to be “phenomenally humble”? It’s essentially saying you’re the absolute best at being modest, which negates the whole thing. Discuss.)

Rose was in her pyjamas and her hair was still messy, she had toast in one hand and tea in the other and he was suddenly hit by such a strong urge of affection and the desire to give her a quick morning kiss. He blinked and studied his own toast, wondering if there could be something bizarre in the jam that made Time Lords want to snog and do unspeakable things with humans, like run across a field of flowers into their arms or serenade them on a bridge in Barcelona. He took another bite. It was clearly plotting against him but it tasted rather nice all the same. Perhaps that was part of the process of taking over his emotions, tasting great so that he kept eating it.  “You’re looking at that toast like it’s out to get you.”

“This is it, Ted. Go big or go home.”
“I can go home?” he asked hopefully.

“But, it’s a good thing. Why would it need to be confidential?”

~ When Uncle Dean waltzes in dressed up like a policeman, she informs him mournfully that she couldn’t use her paperclip (grimy with age and pulled out from one of her ribboned braids) to undo her cuffs because they didn’t cuff her. She’s outraged and loud and squeaking when she says it, because she’s old enough to be handcuffed, she really is; Uncle Dean says Daddy was once cuffed when he was seven because he wouldn’t stop biting the policeman who tried to take him away from Granddad. They didn’t cuff her because she’s a girl, Dana knows, and she tells Uncle Dean that too.
~ Well, not really kids. They’re as old as some of the Marines on Atlantis, as old as Cadman is or Ford had been, and Rodney has got to stop thinking of the people who save his ass on a regular basis as children.

They kill humans by draining them of their energy in much the same way I’m assuming vampires drain humans of blood.” “Oh,” Dean says. He looks at Sam and makes the universal sign for “this guy is fucking nuts.”
~ “That’s true,” Sam Winchester says and waits for Teal’c to speak again. Teal’c appreciates that he does not offer additional information; as a result, he provides Teal’c with no unforeseen tactical advantage by inadvertently disclosing that which may be used against him.

Mostly, he still thinks it’s a Tragic Secret, and gets drunk and slurs sad Russian songs about betrayal and despair and the fundamental unfairness of the universe.  “She just wants to be friends,” he says to Sulu, who is concentrating on being a sympathetic friend and not laughing at Chekhov, who is flailing dramatically. “Is like a dagger through my heart!”

“Sir,” Malcolm said sharply, cornering Potter in his own office the second his superior stepped through his personal Floo connection. Late again, he noted absently. “Have you read my report on the Illegal Kneazle Breeding Ring Incident yet?” Potter froze, running a hand through his ridiculously untidy hair—sloppy, everything about him was sloppy, Malcolm thought disdainfully. Green eyes glanced automatically at The Desk, a near impossibility of existence—the surface hadn’t been seen since Potter’s second week as Head Auror, and paperwork was piled so high and so precariously that there was no explanation for how it managed to stay in place aside from ‘magic’. Those bizarre little ‘post-it notes’ that had recently come into fashion practically plastered the sides, until the only glimpse Malcolm could get of the desk itself was its legs. Charmed memos fluttered in constant low orbit around both The Desk and the chair. Malcolm and Su Li had once done a little late night investigation and discovered that ignored howlers had burst into flames deep within the pile, creating charred caverns of ash invisible to the naked eye. 
Suddenly Potter looked at Malcolm—no, not at him, over his shoulder. Bespectacled eyes went wide. “Look,” he cried dramatically, pointing a finger. “A fuzzy puppy!” Malcolm didn’t mean to turn and look, but instincts honed by seven years in Slytherin had him pivoting on one heel, his other foot already raised, ready to kick. It wasn’t that he particularly disliked fuzzy puppies, but kicking them was just what one did when one was in Slytherin. The office was empty of canines, and when Malcolm whirled back around, eyes narrowed, it was empty of Potters as well.
~
“I’m pretty sure it’s alive,” Potter said sheepishly. “I, uh, apparently cast an interesting mix of spells to keep it quiet and in place and, er, not on fire, and now sometimes it starts...moving. And making noises. I’m teaching it to say my name,” he added brightly.
On cue, The Desk grumbled something that sounded suspiciously like “Rrry Pttr”. Malcolm groaned.
~
“No, Mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I’m home safe does not prove that it worked. That logic is post hoc ergo proctor hoc…No, I’m not sassing you in Eskimo talk.”

“I was so happy! In the world of emoticons, I was colon capital D.”
~
“Basically, you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator.”
“I thought we were going to going to be gentle with him.”
“That’s why I added the ‘ator’.”
~
“What do you mean it was the only way to make him happy? Why did you have to make him happy?”
“Because when he wasn’t happy, we weren’t happy and we wanted to kill him. That was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside and when he went out to retrieve it, shut the door behind him and let him freeze to death.”
“That seems a bit like overkill.”
“No, overkill was the plan that involved tying your limbs to four different dog sleds and yelling ‘Mush!’.”
~
“Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the force, so I’d say he’s doing a little better.”
~
“Oh, you think you’re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your email periodically for a doozy.”
~
“How do you know he ran away?”
“Well, he’s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said ‘I’m running away’.”
~
“Hmm, it sounds like a cricket.”
“Hang on,” Sheldon checks his watch. “Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.”

“I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not by nature at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased my up the big elm tree in front of our house.”
“Chickens can’t climb trees.”
“Thank God.”
~
“Well, I grew up with an older brother and a cantankerous twin sister and I believe I could take you in any classic confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the ever classic why are you hitting yourself.”
“Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.”
~
“I mean he seems like Dr. Do-Good but the first few months I knew the guy, he did nothing but lie to me.” He looks up, noticing Logan was awake. “Dude, don’t get me wrong, you’re a stand-up guy but seriously, I was a little thrown by the pathological lying.”
“Cut me a break,” Logan mutters. He sits down, just out of contact range of Max. “I thought you were a serial killer at the time.”
Dean shakes his head. “Fucking shapeshifters.”
~ “This is insane,” Dean says for the twentieth time in the past hour. “Like really, really suicidally insane. I didn’t think you’d have it in you. Not even crazy post-apocalyptic you.”

“I’ve made a chart of how Michael spends his time. This part here is procrastinating. This bit is distracting others. And this tiny little sliver is critical thinking. I made it bigger so that you can see it.”

And Sam had to acknowledge that maniacal laughter might not actually be an unreasonable response to the situation.
“Our lives are so weird,” he said heavily.
~
I am a mountain. I am solid. Unchanging. The winds blow, the sun beats down, the rains fall but I am unaffected. I am serene. I want to lift Krait up by the collar of his shirt and the seat of his pants and throw him through the bay win—He caught himself. “Just through here,” he beckoned.
~
“Why wasn’t I born a boy?” she complained as she sat down next to Alex. “If I hear another girl whine about how her hair is all frizzy now I’m going to—do something!”
Alex gave her an amused look. “Do something? Surprisingly, I find myself not terrified.”
She glared at him. “Don’t even think of giving me a hard time. I have spent the entire day restraining my inner bitch. I am not responsible if I snap and kick someone in the balls.”
“Are you having your visit from Mr. Flow?” Nick asked, mock-understandingly.
“Or castrate them,” Emma added pointedly.
~
“I know, but the fact of the matter is that I’ve got a better broom and, what’s more, I’m simply better at this than he is. The only time I’ve ever lost is due to circumstances beyond my control and if, for some ungodly reason, Dementors invade again, I’m catching the Snitch THEN saving everyone’s souls,” Harry vowed.
“Good to see you have your priorities in order,” Ginny said sarcastically. “And speaking of, if you die, can I have your broom?”
~
“Said you’re mad as a hatter but practically a demon on a broom. I said to him – Ced, that’ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will…you beat Harry Potter!”
“How does it feel to have your father deciding that winning an amateur Quidditch Match is going to be your greatest achievement in life?” Harry asked curiously.
Cedric made a face. “Fantastic. I’d imagine it’s almost as nice as having everyone decide that you’re greatest achievement will be making it to your second birthday, something everyone else has managed just fine without getting famous.”
~
“No,” Mickey said. “Maybe,” Rose said.  Pete looked to Jake, who shook his head. “I’m just sitting here, reading my paper. I am opinionless.” “Spineless,” Mickey muttered.
~
Their epic saga of will-they-won’t-they had recently resolved itself (to neither one’s satisfaction) as they-will-but-just-the-once-because-apparently-they-are-both-idiots.
~ Mickey chuckled. “Well, mate, after the incident with the toad and the helium tank—” “That was an accident.” He turned back to Rose and frowned. “Why would someone put a banana in your bed, anyway?” A devilish grin split Mickey’s profile. “Well,” he began, his voice rich with innuendo, but just then his car went hurtling off the racetrack and burst into flame. “Bollocks.” Reggie dropped his controller, sat up, and stretched, the hem of his too-small Spiderman pyjama top riding up. “I win. Again.” He gave Mickey a sweetly sincere smile. “I could pretend to be surprised, if that’d make you feel better.”
~
Then one day the copy machine down the corridor from her office burst into flame. As this was rather unusual behaviour for a copy machine – even at Torchwood – the charred equipment was quickly and cautiously dissected by the people Torchwood employed for exactly that sort of thing. Rose struggled to be surprised by what they found, and failed. For lodged in the tight, delicate machinery of the copier, they’d discovered about one banana’s worth of smoking yellow pulp. Mickey, Rose, and Jake stood around the laboratory table and stared at the banana mush-filled dish at its centre. 
“They ran every test they could think of, and Schmidt says this one is just like the others. A perfectly normal, everyday banana.”  “Perfectly normal, everyday bananas don’t materialize out of thin air,” Mickey countered. “There’s no way anyone could have fit that banana inside that copy machine.” Jake crossed his arms over his chest. “Could have dismantled it.” “I think someone would have noticed, don’t you?” Mickey said, echoing his defensive posture. Jake snorted. “So we’re back to the space monkey mafia theory, are we?”
~ “Maybe it was mice?” Dean says, after a minute. “When is it ever mice, Dean? Also, mice don’t sing,” 
“Rats?” Dean says, after a pause.
~ “Simple is best, Sam. They come out. We see what they are. They’re evil, we kill them with bullets and pain and fire. They’re good, we ask politely for our shit back.”
~ “WE’RE GNOMES OKAY,” screeches the gnome, its huge, liquid blue eyes take up half its head and are currently glaring at Dean from a foot away.  “Okay, seriously,” Dean says to the tiny, lumpy man shaped thing he holds by the back of its brown shirt. “It’s calm time now.” The gnome squeaks loudly and incoherently for at least a minute and a half in what Dean and Sam assume to be its language. “I’m sorry,” Dean says. “I didn’t...” He pauses and coughs not at all discreetly to hide the hysterical laughter bubbling up in the back of his throat. The gnome is so TINY and ANGRY. When Dean looks into its little red squishy face he forgives it and its friends for pilfering all his stuff. “I didn’t catch all that,” he finishes, when he gets himself under control.  “I SAID YOU HAVE MY SHOE TOO.” The gnome dissolves into a squeaking, burbling song that is very clearly the equivalent of a threat in English that would involve Dean’s slow roasting torture.  “That is... so cute,” Sam says, staring at the gnome’s flailing body.
~
“I swear,” the gnome squeaks solemnly. After Dean puts him down and the gnome does the apparent gnome version of sealing the deal with a handshake, which involves a dance not unlike the Macarena.
~ “Rose,” he said, lingering over the sound of her name, his fingers dancing over her lips like a breath. “You’re not smiling.”  “Sorry,” she replied, her voice thick. “Too happy to smile.” His eyebrows arched towards his hairline. “Have you broken your face?” Rose shook her head mutely, drinking in the sight of him. She took a moment to catalogue the details lost to time and fallible human memory – the lines around his eyes, the quirk of his lips, the slight crookedness of his nose. “You’re really here.” She reached up and mirrored his touch, letting her fingers trace his mouth. His eyes closed as he leaned into the caress, dry lips brushing her skin. “I can tell, because in my dreams you’re not usually this smug.”
~ “I didn’t call you stupid. I’ve never called you stupid.” One hand raked violently through his hair, leaving disaster in its wake. “Except, yes, you are a bit stupid. Because you’d have to be, wouldn’t you, not to see what is apparently completely obvious to half the sentient beings in the universe – that is, the fairly well-known fact that I am, for lack of a better term, apparently completely stupidly in love with you.” She stared at him, open-mouthed. He frowned to himself, looking rumpled and a little off-balance. “Hadn’t meant to say that, actually. I forgot how irritating you could be.”
She closed her mouth, and then opened it again. “Did you just—” “I did.” He squirmed, his hand moving to the back of his neck. “Let’s not make a big thing of it, yeah? It’s just something I said.”  “Just something you said,” she repeated, trying not to sound entirely stunned. “All right.”
“I’m not taking it back or anything, mind you, but it’s not something we need to talk about. We can just move on to something else now.” She pressed the heel of her palm to her temple and closed her eyes. “Move on from the fact that you—” “That I’m in love with you, yes.” She opened her eyes just in time to catch his horrified expression. “Listen to me – I’ve said it again. I’m in love with you.” His eyes widened. “It’s like some sort of compulsion. I can’t stop myself.”  
~ “Oh, he’s gay,” Rose said.  The Doctor beamed. “Brilliant! Always was a cheerful bloke, when he wasn’t glaring at me and muttering under his breath about girlfriend-snatching alie—” He paused. “That’s not what you meant.” 
~
“It was a bit like playing darts. Yes. Like playing darts while blindfolded in an infinitely large room, with both hands tied behind my back and a rather impatient squadron of 51st century police officers at the door.” He paused. “Also, there was an almost sickening amount of immensely complex mathematics involved.” 
~
“Ah, but that was before I invented this.” He reached behind her and pulled a piece of equipment from the console. It was shaped rather like a sea anemone, if sea anemones were made from a Jell-O mould and half a battered transistor radio. “It’s a Vortextual translator circuit. Translation unit.” He paused. “Translating thingy.” She raised an eyebrow, and he tossed it back onto the console. “Well,” he said, “I’m still working on the name.” 
~ A look of deep and uncomfortable concentration passed over his face. “Are you currently or have you recently been in some other sort of exclusive, committed relationship?” She blinked at him. “Are you deranged?” “It’s a perfectly legitimate question!”  “It’s a perfectly idiotic question. Don’t you think I would’ve mentioned it if I—” She stopped, her eyes narrowing. “And since when do you know words like committed, and relationship?” He took another few steps closer, and she found herself trapped between his body and the console. “I know a lot of words, Rose.”  “I don’t doubt it. ..Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus wasn’t about what you thought it would be, huh?”  He frowned. “That title is misleading.”
~ “But I had this friend – you would’ve liked her, I think, or possibly hated her, I can never tell with those sorts of things – I met her just after Canary Wharf, so she knew about—” He made a complicated hand gesture, which Rose translated as you and parallel universes and these inconvenient human emotions. “And this friend, she said – and by said I mean shouted – that I was a bloody alien idiot if just I showed up at your door expecting you to still—” He made another awkward hand gesture, “you know. Particularly given that we’d never actually…” The hand continued to flap, somewhat desperately.  Rose took pity on him. “Had sex?”  The Doctor blushed. Fiercely. “Talked. We’d never talked about anything.” He dragged a hand over his face, looking wretched. “I knew I’d be terrible at this, but I was rather hoping that you might help the conversation along a little.”  She frowned at him. “I’d help the conversation along a bit more if I knew what the hell we were having a conversation about.”  The Doctor rolled his eyes to the ceiling in exasperation. “Stubborn bloody humans,” he said, and kissed her.
~ Rose turned to the Doctor for help, but he just shrugged. She gave him a look that quite clearly said, You are useless, and I will remember this moment next time you want to take off my clothes.”
~
Reggie sighed as only an eight year old boy can sigh – at once communicating his boredom, your painful ineptitude, and an unfulfilled longing for a Game Boy.
~ “Interested in what way? The ‘hey, you look like you’ve got stories to tell’ or the ‘hey, I’m desperate and you’re breathing’ kind of way?”
~
It was only just noon and Sam was already up twenty dollars thanks to the price of gas, bird shit on the car window and a root that Dean didn’t see. Sam chuckled, this swear jar was going to make him a rich man.
~
Sam elbowed his brother. “Leave the cat alone.”
“I hate cats, Sam,” Dean felt the need to remind him.
~
You’re seeing tie-dyed harem leggings too, right? Are those even actually technically harem pants? What is the term for pants that are tight on the legs but have enough room in the crotch to hide Gwen’s other child? Why do we live in a world where such a noun is necessary? Crotch-slings? Knee bags? Pantaballoons?
~
However, every time I see her I think, “Who is that pretty lady? Oh, Paula Patton. She’s so pretty.” I guess my girl crush stems from her being pretty. Because I’m shallow like that. But this time, I must confess, my thought process was more along the lines of, “Who is that pretty lady wearing a skirt made from hideous leftover window treatments from a depressing and poorly decorated brothel that’s gone of out business in these, our depressed economic times? Oh, Paula Patton. She’s so pretty. She deserves better.”
~ “I need a drink,” Dean sighed. “I deserve a drink. A big one. With lots of little friends.”
~
“Dude, how many times do I have to tell you I was pushed?”
Sam raised an eyebrow. “So saying you were taken out by an eighty year old woman is better than saying you tripped?”
Dean cocked his head to one side. “When you say it that way…”
“You suck either way, so whichever story you wanna go with, I’ll stick to it.”
~ “Oh, just tell me, already,” Mary said, impatiently. “We both know you’re going to cave. This whole being injured thing is so making you weak against my will.” She fluttered her eyelashes, just for good measure. He drew back.
“Just so we’re clear,” he said. “I’d rather you’d not do that. It’s…creepy.”
~
He shuddered. “A compromise,” he said. “No phone, but I’ll get you a pager – for emergencies, not for ice cream runs.”
“Now, when have I ever done something like that?” He gave her a look. “Other than that time, of course,” she amended.
~
He finds nothing of her in the world until she is gone from it, until he knows with soul-crushing certainty that the flash of red hair he catches in Diagon will never be hers, never again. And then, as if her death had loosed all she was to settle in others, he finds her everywhere.

The great thing about having a doctor like McCoy for a friend was that they always left an assortment of hangover cures on your bedside table. Jim had popped several pills before even bothering to open his eyes. 
“The abuse of one substance followed by the abuse of another. Illogical.” Jim’s head was pounding and he sat up cradling it, blearily and angrily staring at the source of the noise. “Being in a room not belonging to you at ass-o’clock on a Sunday morning. Illogical,” Jim fired back, his mouth feeling and tasting like gym socks soaked in beer. “The abuse of one substance followed by the abuse of another. Illogical.” ~
He ignores them and keeps walking until one of them grabs him by the shoulder and spins him around and says, “I’m talking to you, freak,” and Spock hauls off and punches him in the nose because being proactive at this point is only logical, and then the other three jump him, so possibly it was less logical than he thought.
~ He beats up the boy who calls his mother a whore. He has a whole argument about how if someone insults your mother’s honour it is only logical to defend it by breaking their nose, which he learned from Jim, that he never quite gets around to using because no one is really angry. He concludes that everyone already tacitly agrees that it is logical to break the nose of someone who calls your mother a whore.

“Seek out new life and new civilisations,” McCoy grumbled. “If this lot are civilised, I don’t wanna meet the barbarians.”

“Actually, your birthday ended about twelve hours ago and the only reason anyone ever though whiskey was medicinal was because people got so drunk they no longer felt ill.”

“Don’t you ever get tired of playing with your titanium phallic symbol?” Uhura asks without looking up from the Vulcan lyre she tunes.  “I have to test the balance, so I can get it just right,” he tells her and retracts the blade. The blade feels light when retracted, but when extended, it swings too heavily to the left. “I’ll bet that’s what you tell all the girls.” “And a few of the boys,” he says without missing a beat. “But I try not to brag.”
~ “...Yes,” Spock said. If Kirk didn’t know better, he would have sworn the other man was feeling a human emotion called ~suspicion~, but Kirk might have been projecting.
~
“They are indispensable,” Spock said. His face was a different shape of stoic. Kirk could almost imagine it looked puzzled.
~ Why You’ve Never Seen It: This movie was only made for TV and the general reaction of the public was so collectively indifferent, that they decided to make a terrible sequel that received a similar amount of disinterest. 
~
The film opens with an already retired Nick Fury, who lives comfortably in the Yukon until he receives a call from S.H.I.E.L.D. who explain that Fury’s “old nemesis has returned,” and only he can stop the bad guys, because apparently there isn’t a single other S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who is qualified to do anything. The plot is painfully and needlessly drawn out. Fury returns to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in order to diffuse the threat which turns out to be that the children of his old nemesis have a deadly virus. We quickly realize the real problem is that S.H.I.E.L.D. thinks a one-eyed, cigar-chomping, retired David Hasselhoff would be better at stopping it than a giant flying helicarrier. The plan falls just outside the borders of “too retarded to be believable” but lands somewhere in “just retarded enough to work” territory, so Nick Fury saves the day. The weirdest thing about this movie is that it shouldn’t have sucked. It was written by David S. Goyer, the guy who wrote The Dark Knight. The biggest non-Hasselhoff-related problem is it couldn’t decide if it was a serious drama or a high camp movie, and it failed at both. And the biggest Hasselhoff-related problem is that David Hasselhoff was in it.

One day they attempt a science experiment involving a comet that leaves Doom horribly scarred. Instead of learning from his friend’s mistake, Reed decides to do the exact thing, only with faster science and some innocent friends. When he conducts the exact same experiment with Johnny Storm, Sue Storm and Ben Grimm, lo and behold, it fucks them up too. But instead of killing them, it gives them extraordinary powers. Science. Three of the Fantastic Four are kidnapped by Dr. Doom’s henchmen, for reasons that are never quite clear. The Thing goes to live in the sewer with a gang of jewel thieves led by The Jeweler, but then Doom steals an important diamond from The Jeweler, because he needs it to power a laser he plans on using to destroy New York. Questions are raised all over the place: Why did Doom get an iron mask instead of, say, reconstructive surgery? If you’re stealing diamonds, why are you still living in the sewers? What time is it? While some questions are answered (for example, “It’s Clobberin’ time, for real”), most are completely ignored. And if all of this seems confusing, keep in mind there’s also a blind artist and at least two marriage subplots. The team eventually uses some hard science to stop Doom and the laser, and, while they’re not totally sure why, they decide to fight crime forever.
~ While most Superman stories boil down to “He punches something REALLY hard” (or in the grittier, psychological stories, “He’s really DETERMINED to punch something really hard”), the Flash’s stories are based on a fine balance. The balance between the colossal stupidity of his enemies and the not-quite-so-colossal stupidity of the hero, who never seems to remember that since he has superhuman speed, he could kill anyone before they even know they’re his enemy, literally the instant he decides to do so.
~ How do you take on a hero who can outrun bullets? If you’re George Harkness you think, “I’ll use slower projectiles that are designed to return to me, and because I have the mental faculties of a goldfish and have already forgotten the beginning of this sentence, I will then strap explosives to these projectiles! I can see no possible flaw in this plan!” Harkness turned to crime after an audience ridiculed his boomeranging prowess, a decision which turned out even worse than you’d expect. Captain Boomerang is considered a joke even among the Rogue’s Gallery of mental patients that are Flash villains, and those guys take orders from a talking Gorilla.

Super-breath is Superman’s way of pointing out he doesn’t even need to touch you to kick your ass.
~ Why It Could Be Cool: It looks pretty cool, and considering Chewbacca can do a pretty good job of tearing your head off without a weapon, you’d assume whatever he’s carrying is ten times as badass as, say, whatever Han is carrying. Why It Is Absolutely Not Cool: According to the type of people who study the workings of completely fictional weapons, the bowcaster is like a crossbow that uses two polarizing orbs to generate a magnetic field to accelerate the little arrows. That’s right. Instead of the hundreds of other energy weapons available in the Star Wars universe, this one decides to use a technology we gave up somewhere around the time we decided that being covered in mud and shit wasn’t all that cool. Sure, the bolt is covered in a sheath of something called plasmoid, but then what’s the point of having a little bit of metal in the middle of it? Why not just fire the energy? Is there some super-futuristic armor in the Star Wars universe that can stop an energy beam but not an arrow? The bowcaster also has to be cocked before each shot, which would be fine if you were fighting the Senior Citizens of the Molasses Nebula, but can be bothersome when the enemy can fire unlimited blasts of energy at the speed of light. Hell, we’re pretty sure that alone makes the bowcaster shittier than the guns you can pick up in an average pawn shop.

The saddest part about the boxing glove arrow is that in order for it to be even plausibly aerodynamic, the boxing glove has to be shrunk down to about the size of a baby’s fist. Now, babies are terrifying in their own way, but it has nothing to do with their fists and everything to do with their shitty diapers. Put one of those on the end of an arrow and maybe you’d have something.
~ It isn’t that it can destroy anything at the speed of thought. It isn’t that it looks like a camera from the twenties. It isn’t even that the guy who made it—Galactus—is basically a god who shouldn’t even need a weapon. It’s that there isn’t even a half-assed attempt to explain how it’s supposed to work. No pseudo-scientific jargon, no magic incantations, no nothing. It just nullifies. It’s like they bought it from some dude in an alley. “Trust me, dude, if you need something nullified, this’ll nullify it right up.” The Ultimate Nullifier is especially effective against gaping plot holes.

Want to use it as a gun? Well, too bad, you’ve got like 20 pounds of sword weighing down the barrel while you try to aim it with one hand. Want to put your hand on the end there to hold it up like a rifle? Congratulations, you’ve just joined the “I sliced off all my fingers with a fantasy weapon” club. Want to use it as a sword? Also too bad, you’ve got to hold it by this idiotic little grip made for revolvers, and the first time you stab somebody you’re going to get the tiny little barrel on the end crammed full of bad guy guts. So the next time you try to use it as a gun, it’s going to blow your other hand off. Pretty much the only use for this thing would be to mail it to the enemy the day before the battle in gift wrap, and pray they’re stupid enough to use it.
~ The plunger isn’t the Dalek’s main weapon—that would be the egg whisk thing to the left—but it’s still pretty useful. It can open doors, move things and strangle people.  You know what else can do that? Hands. Why the Daleks chose to go with plungers over hands is never quite explained in the series but, then again, neither is the fact that they only have one eye that can easily be covered with a hat.

As a rule, the moment classic toys are introduced to electricity, shit starts getting out of hand. This rule has not been lost on Mattel who recently released this: The Speed Racer Sky Jump Track. This is the culmination of cars, track, electric motors and gravity all wrapped into one giant ball of sheer what-the-fuckery. We’ve examined the photos and we’ve even watched this commercial for the thing and still have no idea what’s going on. It is awesome, however, so we really couldn’t care less how it works.
~ “Evil takes many forms,” Zabini said piously, though it came out a little muffled, as he was guarding his head with both his hands—lest, no doubt, his face take many forms. Around Harry’s fist.
“I will hurt you,” Harry said, a statement of fact rather than a threat. “I really, truly will.”
Zabini swallowed heavily. “Look. Your next assignment is a good one, Potter, I swear. No bears. No sudden drops from flying cars. No magical fluffy bellies. Although honestly, Potter, only you could manage to alienate their entire society to the point where they’d attempt to murder you by flying car. I mean, they called themselves the Care Bears, for Merlin’s sake.”
“I hate you so much,” Harry grumbled, because it was kind of hard to argue with that. “So very much.”
~ “I don’t even care if you go evil,” he told the boy sitting across the table. “Just never, ever stop living here. In fact, please indulge in the occasional bout of moral ambiguity. I’ll tell everyone I need to do regular risk assessments or something official-sounding like that and visit, oh, once a month. Week. Once a week.”
~ “Are you my mummy?” Harry’s newest assigment asked, head tilted a little to the side. He took a small step towards Harry—who backed away, sneaking his wand into his hand. This was one mission that was not, he suspected, going to end in a month’s supply of free chocolate and a transdimensional Weasley-Potter-Wonka partnership.
“Not even a little,” Harry said honestly. Which was a good thing, because being a full-time father to his two boys (plus, he was beginning to suspect Ginny was pregnant again and just refusing to admit it in case he tried to make her take it easy at Quidditch) and a part-time father to Teddy and his numerous nieces, nephews, godchildren, employees’ children, and random lost children on the street—well, he was booked pretty solid, in the paternal sense. Than, he considered Ginny’s habit of telling the kids to ‘walk it off’ when they were crying and bleeding from scraped knees and elbows, and decided he was booked solid in the maternal sense too, really.
“Are you my mummy?” the boy repeated, taking a step forward and sounding a little frustrated, now. Harry had faced Inferi, and Voldemort, and Dobby on a sugar high, and he could honestly say he’d never been quite as unsettled as he was right now. That, Harry decided, edging backwards, was very much that. He just did not get paid enough for this nonsense.

Sheldon glanced at James’ outstretched hand just long enough to show he wasn’t going to touch it, and then nodded his head in greeting instead. “Dr. Sheldon Cooper, Ph.D.”
~
Sheldon growled suddenly and then threw the pages down to the ground in a fit of frustration. “Oh, this is tripe!” Then he immediately bent down to gather all the papers up, meticulously checking page numbers to keep them in the proper order.
~ “As serious as van Vleck determinants are to traversable wormhole spacetimes,” Sheldon stated matter-of-factly.
Penny pressed her lips together in annoyance. “Which means...?”
“He’s serious,” Leonard put in helpfully.
~ “Jim, heart attack,” he says, waving his fork at the tray in front of his friend. “Heart attack, Jim. Thought I should introduce you; you’re sure to become intimately acquainted sometime soon.”
~ Pike finds himself rearranging the strategy he’d laid out for this conversation, because Jim doesn’t sound hurt, or bitter, or angry. He sounds amused.
~ “I was just about to call you,” Marshall said, when he answered. She could hear his car engine in the background.
“What have I told you about lying to me?” Mary asked, as she eyed the toast on the tray, and picked a slice up. It was cold.
“I know, but sometimes you have to try,” he said.
“You’re going to make me work for this, aren’t you?” she said, as she took a bite. Yuck.
“You’re not going to like it,” he admitted.
“Yeah, I’m getting a lot of that, lately,” Mary said, as she dropped the toast back onto the plate. “On a scale of one to ten, how bad is it? One being cold toast and ten being an earthquake hitting Albuquerque…?”
“Think a mountain of cold toast,” he said. “Served with really stale coffee.”
~
“And you’re doing that tangent thing, again, I hate it when you do that.”
“Fine,” Marshall said. “I-found-Lauren-in-your-house-this-morning-having-breakfast-in-your-kitchen.”
“Jeeze, Marshall,” Mary said. “You couldn’t have softened that up a little?”
“And be accused of going off on a tangent?” he drawled. “Heaven forbid.”
“Jackass,” Mary pronounced.
“Do you want to hear the story or not?”
“Well, duh,” Mary said, “I’ll need to have my facts straight, when I crucify my family with them.”
~ “He keeps crying.” Alec’s voice is petulance and irritation merging between heavy sheets of concern.
~ “You relaxed,” Alec points out.
“But I was alert.”
“You’re not alert right now. You’re too busy pointing out how we’re not alert.”
~ “Sam said it was clean,” Ben explains. Ben wondered how Sam knew, but the trust that the statement was fact was instantaneous.
~ She comes forward with that rotting hand of hers and she’s reaching for Ben, but Sam’s reaching for his gun and then he’s pointing it at her head and telling her to back the fuck off.
~ It’s the ugliest goddamn thing Alec’s ever seen in his entire life. And he’s not wearing it. “It’s the ugliest goddamn thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life,” he informs Sam. “And I’m not wearing it.” He’s not. Not ever. Goodwill sucks ass. It doesn’t even have light-up sneakers.
~
“This?” He blinks. “This is an injury.”
“Boo boo,” she repeats.
“No.” Alec says the word like Dean says the word. “Injury. Say injury.”
~
“Did it sting?” Sam’s giant forehead is creased in effeminate worry. “M’sorry, buddy. D’ya want a plain band-aid or a Batman band-aid?”
Alec wants to smack a bitch. He really does. Here he is being treated like he’s three years old on a playground while the devil’s sticky-fingered incarnate watches and his twin, his Ben, has successfully snuck off to the monkey bars where he’s now observing from afar, every so often directing a mocking face at Alec’s situation. Alec would make faces back but unfortunately, and through no fault of his own, he’s at the center of everyone’s attention.
“Batman,” he mumbles, because they won’t let him not answer and Batman is clearly the superior choice, the choice that makes Dean beam and smack at Sam’s shoulder with the back of a ringed hand.
“I told you they’d like the Batman band-aids. And you called ‘em a waste of money...”
~ “Alec and I want some mescaline,” Ben announces. Okay. That wasn’t on the list. At all. But Alec’s gotta admit he’s curious as to where his brother’s going to take this. Sam’s hands are reaching out again, his jaw clenched tight as he grits his teeth, and he looks for all the world like he’s about to cut a bitch. Alec can only see the back of Dean’s head, but he’s pretty sure he knows the look the guy’s got fixed on Ben; that pale and scandalized look that Dean gets whenever Sam mentions sexual reproduction while Alec and Ben are present.
“Benny, you don’t even know what mescaline is,” Dean says, and there’s a tinge of hope in his voice that makes Alec snicker, because of course Ben knows what mescaline is.
“Sure I do. It’s a psychedelic alkaloid.”
Sam looks kinda proud now, because they’re geniuses and that’s something he’ll always encourage, but he’s saying, “Ben, mind-altering drugs are incredibly dangerous and not something you should ever think about. Or joke about. Or do. Ever.”
“Alec and I want five sheets of high-powered blotter acid,” Ben replies.
Sam smacks, literally smacks, his palm against his face. His voice is muffled behind his hand. “Dean...the chimp and Christina Ricci? He friggin’ memorized the movie, you stupid ass.”
He. Singular. No, no, Alec has to get in on this. Ben’s being brave and all, but Alec’s gotta help him out. “Ben and I want a salt-shaker half-full of cocaine.”
~
“You...want...an orca?” The words are slow tumbling out of Sam’s mouth but Ben nods and Alec half climbs over Dean’s back so Sam can see him nod, too.
“It’s a proven mode of transportation,” Alec chimes in, pointing to the screen of the television which really has no relevance at the moment. “That kid rode that motherfucking whale. It was inspiring, Sam.”
“Language.” Alec feels Dean rumble the word beneath him, hears and sees Sam’s lips form the same word. He ignores it. This is about far more important things than socially scorned words.
~
“Dean, this isn’t funny,” Alec tells him, dropping from his elbows so that his hands come down with a smack on his donor/brother/dad’s shoulders. Dean is just so many things, too. “This is serious business.”
“Sam—” Dean can’t get the words out. He’s trying so hard but he can’t get the words out. Alec waits patiently. Ben waits patiently. Sam rolls his eyes and sighs and jiggles his leg. It takes forever, but Dean finally croaks, “I just remembered that Sammy wanted an orca, too.”
Alec raises an eyebrow, because hey now, that’s an interesting fact. He’ll gladly share his orca with Sam if Sam begs hard enough.
“I did not want an orca, Dean. Stop making shit up.”
“I’m not making shit up. You wanted an orca. You kept trying to find cases on the coast so Dad would take us to the ocean.” Dean is a 9.5 on the Richter Scale. Alec curls his fingers into the man’s soft T-shirt for balance as the guy cracks the fuck up.
“We’ll share our orca with you, Sam,” Ben offers. “If you really want...”

~ More recently, Dracula showed up in the sadly canceled “Captain Britain and MI-13,” where he swapped the bitchin’ ‘70s ‘stache that Gene Colan gave him for a more fashionable goatee and declared war on the United Kingdom from his castle on the moon before setting sail through space on his magic pirate ship, because comic books are awesome. Unfortunately for him, MI-13 had access to both Excalibur (the sword, not the super-team) and two characters who pretty much do nothing but murder vampires, which led to him being pretty thoroughly killed. Again. Still, coming back to life is what that guy does, so we doubt he’ll be down for long... if only thanks to the power of the mustache.
~ Behold! Dracula: Lord of the Overbite! Even if you discount his problems with orthodontia, this version of Dracula still isn’t quite up to snuff, mostly owing to the fact that his master plan is to come to Gotham City and fight Batman, which, as any villain that’s been dropped off at Arkham at three in the morning with a broken nose and a few missing teeth could’ve told him, was not one of his better ideas.
~ I get this dress in theory. It’s sexy and lacy and something I could imagine seeing on a recently widowed French prostitute—which isn’t necessarily as tragic as it sounds, because...you know, the French can pull things off the way the rest of us can not—and I could be talked into believing that it looks better in person than it does in photos, even if there is no real way that she doesn’t need maybe an extra half inch in the hem. In fact, I feel like I could secretly love this regardless of skimpiness if it didn’t come complete with a built-in feather-y neck brace. As I always say, when you are modeling crotchtacular, semi-sheer classy French prostitute-widow’s weeds, a feather-y neck brace is, frankly, just overkill.

The machine consisted of a lot more than just the titular elephant, but most of that stuff was French bullshit like “art” and “wonder.” You, dear reader? You only need to know about that magnificent bastard of terror right up there: It’s 40-feet tall, weighs 50-tons and requires 22 people to operate. The idea was presumably conceived when someone saw Return of the King and, upon noting the monstrous four-story elephant-like hell-beasts depicted therein, immediately thought, “I would like for that to be more unstoppable. If only it were also a robot!”
~
Oh no, ha ha! Not that kind of fire truck! Did you think it was a method for putting out the several dozen rampaging mechanical infernos that almost certainly run amok by the end of every show? No. No, it is a truck that spews pillars of flame. The fire truck comes equipped with a fully functioning blacksmith forge mounted in back, as well as a welding and torch cutting setup in front–you know, just in case somebody calls your manhood into question when you pull up in your fire-ball spewing big rig, now you can bust out an impromptu sword in no time. Don’t laugh; it’s totally practical. The only guy who’d call you out in that thing is Conan the Barbarian, and he ends every sentence with a broadsword instead of a period. You need to come prepared.
~
I’m not really sure why it was there, and I am unable to check at this time because I refuse to look away from that thing even for a moment. Objectively, I know that’s just a picture. But I simply do not have enough confidence in my senses to risk glancing away, just in case they’re wrong and that thing’s actually in the room with me. I will tell you what I do know off-hand: It comes equipped with steam and water cannons to the front and rear–hopefully some sort of anti-Will Smith alarm comes standard–and if you ever actually get up on one, Captain Planet will appear out of nowhere and try to fight you.

“I think it means that he sent it with love.”
Cissy rolled her eyes. “Well, yes, obviously,” she moaned exasperatedly, “but did he mean love as in, ‘I want to marry you and father your children’ sort of love, or ‘favourite cousin’ sort of love? Because those are two entirely separate types of love.”

Remember when Batman got all paranoid and built a secret O.M.A.C. spy satellite that transformed regular joes into super hero killing machines during “Infinite Crisis?” This episode will be nothing like that. It is titled “When OMAC Attacks,” but instead of being crazy, Batman will team up with the old-school Kirby Buddy Blank, who transforms into the mohawkified OMAC at the behest of the noble Brother EYE satellite. The best part? They battle evil.
~ I know it’s kind of busy, and I know that I can’t completely tell what the pattern is because I’m squinting at my laptop screen due to the fact that I’m forced to work at a Coffee Bean that appears to be located on the surface of the sun. The skirt, through my near-closed eyes, reminds me a bit of very cold bumblebees being squashed, although maybe that’s just me projecting my dislike of bees. Yes, I’ve heard they have secret lives, but they also want to violate my flesh, which is NOT OKAY.

The honeymoon cottage was nicer than Han had expected, considering that Chewbacca and his son had built it. Chewie hadn’t done anything vaguely resembling carpentry since some Imperial slaver had handed him his first hydrospanner. But Chewie’d grunted that family had to build it; that was tradition; and no, Han wasn’t allowed to help, but should go off and kill something as a gift for the bride. […] Her bare feet pressed into the soft carpet that, Chewbacca had proudly assured Han, had been woven from the cast-off hairs of his four grandparents for the occasion of Chewie’s own long-ago wedding. Han hadn’t decided how to relay that particular information to Leia yet.

‘She jumped in front of me.’ Castle hasn’t meant to say this, but there are things reorganising themselves inside his head and this is one of them: that she told him once he was putting her men in danger by not staying outside, but she never said a word about herself. Maybe if she had, maybe if she’d said it just like that, you’re going to be the one who gets me killed, maybe then he would have listened.

He definitely remembers reading somewhere that space made you paranoid. He thinks maybe he should mention it to Bones. He won’t mention the part about bears bringing babies, though.
~ “Sulu says you have a thing for that brunette in the AstroLab,” he says to Chekov, and the Navigator spins round, eyes wide in betrayal. “Sir!” he says, looking around furtively like it’s some kind of secret and not something everyone on the damn ship knows abo
~
Chekov shrugs. “Actually, I do not know so many girls.” “But at the Academy…” Jim breaks off. Chekov is shaking his head. “Sisters? Cousins? Aunts?” Chekov’s still looking sad and shaking his head. Jim’s getting desperate. “What about your mom?” Chekov hangs his head. “I was raised by monks in Siberian orphanage,” he says. Jim concedes momentary defeat. 
~ “She’ll be on like this forever, I expect,” she says, with the air of someone who knows. “Fancy a walk?” The Doctor regards her seriously. “There aren’t enough languages in the known galaxy to convey how much yes I can say,” he answers, and takes her hand.
~
Surprisingly, there’s dancing in the rain. Not so surprisingly, there’s setting the kitchen on fire, too. And yet as charming as it is watching him fly through the torrents, lightning making his eyes a bright silver and thunder bringing laughter barrelling from his chest, it’s all slightly less wonderful when he insists on sticking a spoon in the microwave, just to see things explode. “Well, it’s not as if we’ve got any planets to liberate, is it?” he asks, when the smouldering remains of the kitchen stare at her with accusing, empty eyes and he is scratching his ears sheepishly. The fire brigade just sort of square their shoulders and walk right in, because by now, it’s a bit too routine to be real. “I was bored! And the fire was a small fire, a tiny fire, a really pretty fire, actually, Rose—”
~
“When’s the last time you went on a date?” She had a special laugh for when Tony said things like this. She liked to think it is sort of a humouring laugh, but also a slightly superior one. “Oh, ho, ho,” Tony said, in an uncanny if cruel imitation. “I’m on to you.”  “I don’t have time to date,” she said, stung. “As you know perfectly well.” “Come on, that is so— You have time. I give you time. There’s that guy, whatshisface. Short Stack. You know, with the little glasses.” “That’s your attorney,” Pepper said, exasperated. “I have many late-night meetings with him so you can stay out of prison.”
~
Spock nodded.  “I believe that your colloquialism is the most accurate and concise manner of stating the problem.” “Fuck.”  Bones repeated, just for good measure.
~
Spock moved over to take a bottle for himself, regarding the liquid curiously.  “For the sake of scientific inquiry, Captain, I believe it would be best for us to determine the composition and taste of this product so that an acceptable substitute can be synthesized by the replicators and thereby discourage the crew from dealing in contraband substances.  Plus, if we determine the exact composition, Dr. McCoy may be able to create a targeted hangover cure.” Jim snorted at Spock’s evasion.  “That doesn’t change the fact that we’re dealing in contraband substances.”   Spock, totally deadpan, responded.  “As these substances were a gift and no monies were exchanged in our receiving them, there is no actual dealing to be concerned with. Bones couldn’t help it.  “Spock.  That’s a fascinating and utterly logical explanation. Spock looked proud of himself.  “Yes.  It is.”
~ I was playing my iPod on shuffle. The song, “This is Not the End” by The Bravery came on. The next song was “This is the End” by She Wants Revenge. It was followed by “The End.” by My Chemical Romance. As soon as the songs finished, the battery promptly died. I think my iPod left a suicide note.
~ On the one hand, Paris Hilton’s outfit is being held together by safety pins. On the other, at least something’s working hard to keep her fully clothed. 
~
Today, my new boss introduced “the grandma rule.” We aren’t allowed to say or do anything we wouldn’t do infront of our grandmothers. My grandma is deaf, blind in one eye, and constantly drunk. I win.

“He’s not killing people according to their phobias. Austin wasn’t afraid of heights, he was afraid of spiders.”
“Well, maybe he’s killing people based on the opposite of their phobias. The opposite killer.”
“I don’t know what the opposite of a spider is, but I’m pretty sure it’s not a tall building. There is no opposite killer. If there was, you’d have been killed by a falling rocket scientist years ago.”
~
“I figured it was medieval lit, not advanced evil, so how hard could it be? I know I skipped Intro to Evil or whatever, but I can’t have gotten an F. This guy we’re reading, Chauncy, he can’t even spell!”
“Chaucer, and it’s Middle English.”
“I know. Like, hobbits or whatever. I need to talk to you about this grade. I’m like the scarlet lady with the F on her chest.”
“A.”
“Yeah, if only.”
~
“Terry Marion Karens? Any part of that a boy’s name?”
~
“So, I gotta ask, and you know I gotta ask. Have you been practicing dentistry on large cats? Leopards? Pumas?”
~
“Shut the fuck up,” says the kid wearing Dean’s face, and Sam is shocked afresh, because that’s just wrong coming from a nine year old.  “Don’t say the f wor...” he begins, scandalised, and then bites his tongue as the kid raises a fist and punches him in the solar plexus.
~ Dean regards him narrowly. “Really? Then what did I just say?” “That you were hungry,” says Sam, who is good at multitasking. “Huh.” Dean nods grumpily. “Okay. So – there was this bakery, see. With this real hot chick behind the counter. And the sign said ‘Grand Opening: Free Pie’.” Sam groans. “Oh, Dean!” Dean glowers at him. ““Well how was I supposed to know, Sammy? It was pie! A hot chick giving away free pie!”
“Free evil pie.”
“Pie, Sammy,” protests Dean, plaintively. “Pie!” he sounds like he’s been betrayed by his one true love.
~
“Animal rights activists? Where would they find that much blood to put in the water system? Why would they use blood anyway? Surely they wouldn’t get it from animals, which would defeat the purpose of animal rights? And if it’s human blood then I think we have more serious problems, like the gang of murdering animal rights activists hacking people up in their sleep.”
~ “I can’t help but feel I’m responsible in some way for the impending apocalypse,” Ned says quietly, and it feels strangely terrifying admitting to it out loud. Because admitting to it makes it feel real, and that’s not something he needs right now. “It’s not an apocalypse.” Thunder chooses that exact moment to rattle the Pie Hole with what feels like the entire fury of heaven. Rain hits the window so hard it looks like one constant wave. Then, as if to make absolutely certain the weather has their attention, lightening rips through the darkness, briefly illuminating the terrified faces that hurry past. “If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck,” Emerson says pointedly. Ned sinks in the booth, a quiet dejected deflation, worthy of world-destroyers everywhere. “You didn’t cause the apocalypse. Emerson, tell him!” Emerson makes his ‘like hell I will’ face.
~ She’s with British footballer Peter Crouch, after a rocky start to their relationship in which he dumped her in the middle of the 2006 World Cup via fax because he decided she was a cheating cokewhore (I paraphrase). He apparently ALSO issued a statement via his lawyer that they’d broken up and he was never going to have anything to do with her again. THAT is way harsh. But anyhoodle, now they’re engaged.
~
“Okay, you’ve got an eleven o’clock with the new sponsors and the production meeting’s been put back until two-thirty so maintenance can do something with the lights in the conference room. And Jared wants to know why you’re ignoring him, only I said you’re not ignoring him you’re just really, really busy and can’t talk at the moment.” “Am I ignoring Jared?” Casey asks around a mouthful of Danish. “You are, but you don’t need to know why.”
~
“Cute? He’s awesome,” Barney declared. “With the Stinson genes, how could he not be?” “Isn’t he adopt—” “This little one is going to grow up to be just like his Uncle Barney,” he interrupted. “Suits, cigars, an epic tale of awesome bachelorhood. It will be a legacy to pass on, from one Stinson to another, like a royal title. I’m Sir Barney Stinson, Duke of Awesome, and someday I’ll pass the title to him.” Barney trailed off, his gaze faraway and unfocused. “You’re, like, this close to buying a throne, aren’t you?” Robin said, crossing her arms. “Nah. Robe and scepter. Much cooler,” he grinned.
~ My cat can discern Coke from Pepsi (and wouldn’t speak to me for a week that one time, despite my explanation that we were broke and it was on sale). He can sense danger (usually in just enough time for me to think ‘oh, the cat looks nervous’ before someone hits me with something heavy). I think that he can also walk through walls, because no matter how carefully I ensure my lab is off limits, he always ends up in there, anyway.
~
“He’s got several reports against him. Apparently he likes to hit women.”
“Reaally? Look at this guy. If I was a woman, I’d just hit him back.”
~
He thumped down the knife and faced her. “What’d you take?” She shrugged. “If you can’t tell, it couldn’t have been important.”
~
“Against his direct orders?” adds Sulu, but he sounds more in awe than disapproving.
~
“Absolutely, sir! Blindfolded, sir!” Spock gives him a look, and Chekov quickly adds, “Not that I’ve tried, sir!”
~
“And drugging him to the gills. Good lord, half of these drugs are to counteract the other half just to keep him alive!”
~ “You’re bleeding all over the transporter pad!” wails the medical attendant.
~ “I believe now is the appropriate time to enact Captain Kirk’s orders,” Spock says, his voice strained. “Right, sir,” says Sulu. “Getting us the hell out of here, sir.”
~ He next regains consciousness very slowly, and the first thing he realizes is that he is really very comfortable. The next thing he realizes is that he has likely been given painkillers, since his thoughts are fuzzy like clouds, and he decides to ignore the noises around him and the lights that filter in through his eyelids and go back to sleep. This becomes difficult, if not impossible, when something soft and light bounces off his face. He frowns and turns his head away from the likely path of the projectile, attempting to mutter “Please desist this behavior,” which comes out more as “Pmph.”
~ In-between a lot of speculation on who killed her and why and a recap of her whole sordid past (which is mostly just a loop of ‘she married someone, he died, so she married someone else’) is the stated fact that her son Blaise has nowhere to go.
~ Blaise is angles and dark skin and huge brown eyes, looking very much like a male version of his mother, to the extent that Remus jokes that if all evidence (seven husbands!) didn’t point to the contrary, he’d think Arabella Zabini had refused to taint her genetics and simply given birth without the help of anyone else.
~ Sirius spends the next week unable to talk about anything except Harry being the youngest Hogwarts seeker in over a hundred years. (Lily and Remus start playing a game when all three of them are together called, ‘How Long Can You Make Sirius Shut Up?’ Remus says that using charms is illegal, Lily responds that snogging him is illegal, so Sirius ends up dodging them as they try to shove socks in his mouth.)
~ In their free time, Landry and Merrythought like to plan their wedding, the date of which changes constantly and ranges from an elopement within the next few days and a grand ball several years from now.
~ “A misunderstanding,” Blaise says coolly. “Malfoy accidentally put his face where my fist happened to be.” “It’s not his fault Malfoy’s got such pointy bones,” one of the Gryffindors chortles, glancing over at where Draco Malfoy is resting at the other end of the room.
~ “Don’t tell anyone, but I plan to be minister within the next fifteen years. Probably inside of ten, if everything goes well.” Sirius makes a laughing snort. “Some secret! You’ve been telling people you were going to rule the world since you were eleven.” “I’ve decided to settle for magical Britain.” “If we don’t tell anyone, how are we supposed to get people to vote for you?” Remus asks wryly.
~
“You’re the one who married a man whose life goal was to grow a beard that rivaled Dumbledore’s.” Lily stares at Remus in horror. “No.” Remus grinned. “He wanted to be able to stroke it and look wise.”
~
She and Remus choose recipes and waver between wanting Sirius to help and threatening him until he stays far, far away from the kitchen and its many bladed and fiery distractions.
~ The Grangers seem to spend a moment silently debating whether or not to tell the Lovegoods that the Christmas decorations they are wearing are usually used on trees and not people, but eventually just compliment them on their festive wear.
~ Severus owls Lily to say that he should technically be asking Harry’s parents to come in for a chat, which is a thinly veiled way of saying he would inform them that if they saw fit to raise tiny little spawn then they should at least do the world the favour of making sure the buggers behave, but any meeting would probably just involve trading insults with James and should therefore be avoided so as to spare everyone the annoyance. What it boils down to is that Slytherins are expected to show off when it suits them and the fact that Harry is a first-year only does him good: he’s too young to be given any truly serious punishment, and the fact that he was able to organise a stunt of that calibre has given him extremely good social status within his house. Please sign the enclosed parchment and owl it back so I may prove that I actually bothered with all this, sincerely, Severus Snape.
~ “But that’s just superstition. Mythology. Conclusions drawn on insufficient data. Intuiting patterns out of the chaos where none exist. And the paradox issue is completely avoided in this model...There is no monster under the bed,” she says, with absolute conviction. “Seems to me you’d know better’n most of us,” Mal mutters.
~ “Let me use it just this once and I’ll teach you how to play,” Wash said. “Women will fall at your feet in a swoon.”  “They already do that,” Jayne said.  “Yes, but that’s usually because you haven’t bathed not because you’ve astonished them with music to soothe their souls,” Wash said. “I’m not above begging, do you want me to beg? I could get on my knees?”
~ “Mimi Van Zucker,” Patsy said slowly. Emily crossed her legs, lifted her chin and looked at her. “Mimi. Van Zucker,” Patsy said again. Emily regarded her coolly. “Mimi. Van. Zucker.”
“You know, I don’t think I look much like a Mimi,” Emily said. “But I’ll tell you when you hit on the right name. Though if you keep guessing the same one, we might be here quite a while.”
“I had to hear it from Mimi Van Zucker. I thought I was your best friend, but apparently you’ve become bosom buddies with Mimi—” “Do not say that name again,” Emily said crisply. “And for anyone to become bosom buddies with that person, she’d first have to grow a bosom.”
~ “Yeah, you should really try and keep it real a little more with the invites,” the other daughter said. “How about something like, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Reynolds are unbelievably relieved to finally announce their daughter’s wedding?” “Kate,” the mother said, but the bride laughed. “Mr. Joseph Reynolds is recovering nicely from his stroke at the announcement that his daughter’s fiancé works at a record store.” “Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Reynolds are thrilled at the prospect of grandchildren conceived without the aid of a turkey baster and space age technology.” “Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Reynolds are pleased and just a little surprised to announce that their daughter is apparently not, in fact, a lesbian. Or at least not a very good one—”
~
“Can you open it?” Brown asked, but really it was a formality. It had better be just a formality; Mrs. Ellis did not appreciate doubts as to her competency.
~
“You don’t have to tell me that. I’m the one who took care of you after you cracked your ribs when you fell out of that tree.”
“You knew him when he was a kid?”
“Kid? That happened four weeks ago. Idiot tried to rescue a cat.”
“The cat was important to a case, I already told you that!”
This time, Gibbs didn’t even try to hide his grin. “A cat DiNozzo?”
“A case relevant, important cat.” Tony muttered and more or less dragged Gibbs towards a flight of stairs behind the counter. 
~
“According to that article, you have, not one, but three potential love interests.”
“I was quite surprised to discover this as well,” Harry replied.
~
“Get dressed? It’s my ship, Zoe. I can wear as much or as little as I like.” Zoe nodded, a small smile forming on her lips. “You’re distracting my husband.” Mal grinned. “I think that says something about the type of man you’ve married.” “He’s distracted by the urge to laugh unkindly, sir.”
~ This was not why he had joined Starfleet, to be patronized by those he thought friends and to drink dissatisfying liquor. Pavel said, “My hatred for you is like...” He could not think of anything strong enough.
~ “You’ve never talked about your parents. Ever.”
Jim looks away, a vaguely unsettled set to his shoulders. “Really?”
“That one time you got really drunk you said Frank was an asshole, but since you then passed out you failed to elaborate on things like who the hell Frank is.”
~ Jim smirks. “Maybe I’ve seen the error of my ways. Maybe I’m completely reformed now. Maybe I’ll even go to church on Sunday.” “And maybe pigs are flying out of my ass,” retorts McCoy.
~
“You would simply… grant me access?” asks Spock, looking confused – for a Vulcan, anyway, which is to say that his eyebrows are at a marginally different angle than usual. Of course, the expression could also be consternation – Kirk isn’t that great at reading Vulcan body language.
~ Spock hesitates again. “Permission to speak freely, Captain?” Kirk sighs. “Are you going to leave if I say no?” Spock considers this, and for a moment Kirk thinks he’s going to say something quintessentially Vulcan, like ‘I find it highly unlikely,’ or ‘it is statistically improbable.’ But Spock settles for something more straightforward: “No.”
~
“Oh!” Hikaru brightens. “Yeah, fencing. I just—” He breaks off and frowns again. “He just mentioned it?” “I have heard him tell the story four times now. He makes sound effects. Little booms, and schwings for the sword.”
~ “I did not know stupidity was a court-martial-able offense,” says Pavel. In his defense, he is on many painkillers for the gash in his leg. “It is on my goddamned ship,” says the Captain heatedly. “When the giant dinosaurs attack, you leave the fighting to the people with advanced combat training, you understand?”
~
“Not if you accept quantum loop theory, which all the data right now is pointing to,” Scotty says loudly. “Now what you’ve got is a non-Schwarzchild black hole, one with spin and maybe charge, that flattens out into a loop—”  “Nyet, no, I do not believe it.” Pavel pours himself some more vodka, and turns to Hikaru, who has been following the conversation with a look of intense, albeit drunken, interest. “What do you think?” “I think,” proclaims Hikaru carefully, “that ‘naked singularity’ is the funniest damn thing I’ve heard in my life.” Pavel turns back to Scotty. “See? Is laughable.”
~ “To ‘make out’ would appear counterproductive to the stated goal of observing the film,” Spock said, but she didn’t hear him complaining when she tugged his head down that she might better kiss that pinch out of his mouth.
~ “I’ve decided that’s my coping mechanism this month. Morbid humour. Next month I think I’ll go with singing every song I can remember in order to pass the time.” Toshiko looked at him with barely disguised horror. “You can’t sing.” “I know lots of songs,” Ianto said. “I’m sure I can carry on for an entire month.” “No, I mean - I’ve heard you sing. You can’t. You sound like a Welsh frog that’s being squashed by a large boot. If you sing I’ll be forced to kill you. And then I’ll have no one to talk to or play igo with and when they rescue me I’ll be insane and it will all be your fault.”
~ “Whom,” Bart said. “Shut up, Bart. No more grammar books for you.” Kon rubbed his forehead harder as a twitch developed over his left eye. ~ “Oh yeah, I’ll just get Oracle to patch me in so I can ask for Tim’s address. Maybe she’ll tell me Batman’s shoe size while I’m at it.” ~ It took half an hour to find Flash, and twenty minutes to help him rescue people from a burning housing complex. 
~
“I wish I could help, but...it was the kid’s decision.” “And you’re afraid of Batman.” “Damn right I’m afraid of Batman.” ~
“Connor?” Bruce went so still, he almost disappeared into the gloom. “But...the—” “If you say ‘the clone,’ I swear I’ll dislocate your shoulder.” Clark let his own anger show. ~
“Are you okay?” “Just rearranging most of my brain. Nothing too serious.” Clark grinned. “Well, if you can be sarcastic, you’re going to be fine.” ~
“Come to Man’s World,” Diana muttered to herself. “Meet interesting and exotic people, and break their legs. See marvels of architecture, as they’re being pushed on top of you.” And find out that despite the wild claims made by manufacturers of hair care products, every single one of their offerings is ineffective at getting out caked blood.
~
“Luck had nothing to do with it,” he said. It was a very Bat thing to say. 
“‘Chance favours the prepared mind,’” said Diana. “And the paranoid perfectionist.”
~
After a moment’s hesitation, Batman entered the room. He took everything in with a glance—and stopped cold. “Bunny slippers?” he said.
“Yes,” said Diana cheerily. “They’re terribly comfortable. You should get some.”
His expression didn’t change. A small, strangled noise, barely perceptible, came from the depths of his throat. “I’ll think it over,” he said.
~
She could tell he hated having to ask. Superman hated dishonesty, the Flash hated freshly-waxed floors, and Batman hated, hated, *hated* not knowing absolutely everything. 
~
“You don’t trust the new transporter because it’s alien technology?”
“Because I’m still not convinced that it doesn’t atomize you, then replace you on the other end with an exact copy that has all your memories.”
~
She was ridiculously nervous. It wasn’t a question of trust: they’d saved each other’s lives too often for that. But Diana had never willingly held her hands out for someone—anyone—to take her strength away. Batman dealt with her trepidation by not noticing.
~
“Luthor’s robot got away. Big Blue’s taking that pretty personally.” He shrugged. “I guess when you have telescopic vision, super-hearing, and X-ray eyes you’re not used to something the size of a building being able to hide from you.” 
~
“I didn’t say I want to grow up and be just like him,” Robin said. He mock-shuddered at the thought. “But love him? Yeah, I can do that. Not that we ever say it, because we’re guys and we’re terribly manly, but off the record? I love him to death. Hey, somebody’s gotta. The man’s never going to love himself.”
~
One of these days, Diana thought, she would solve the mystery of how Batman could arch an eyebrow and make the effect come across with his entire forehead covered.
~
Batman ignored him. “What’s his next excuse? His dog ate it?”
“Luthor disavowed any knowledge of his robot’s activities. It seems one of his hideouts was raided, and the only item stolen—”
“Was the robot,” said Flash. “Ooh, I’d love to see the police report for that. ‘Item: Robot, eight stories tall, nigh-indestructible, suitable for mayhem and destruction. Send usual alert to pawn shops.’”
“You believed him?” said Diana.
“We rounded up a bunch of petty crooks at our last fight with the robot. They’re not talking, but none of them had any ties to Luthor’s organization that the police have found. Besides, Luthor’s a predictable liar. If he’s accused of something he’s actually done, he’ll deny it, calmly. He was still swearing when I left. Luthor’s taken the theft as a personal insult. He wants a piece of whoever it is.”
~
“Hey, you ought to be proud of me,” she said. Her tongue seemed twice as thick as usual, and her mouth was caked with dust. “I went clean through a wall. Last time, I just bounced off one.”
~
“I expect that two recording stars and an award-winning actress are firing their publicists as we speak.”
“That seems excessive,” said Diana. “Just because I’d never heard of them?”
“It’s not you personally,” said Bruce. “They fire their publicists every time it’s brought to their attention that there’s *anybody* who’s never heard of them.”
~
“I hope you know you’re in for a Bat-lecture.” Flash’s voice deepened theatrically. “‘You were in my city. Without permission. Now you’re on the front page. Of my newspaper. But what really bothers me is, somebody raided my closet at the Watchtower, and in that picture you’re wearing my evening gown.’”
“It’s not my colour,” said a grim voice from behind Flash. A red blur streaked across Diana’s vision. When it cleared, Flash was gone, and Batman stood in his place.
“He had a point,” said Diana. “It was your evening gown.”
“Trust me,” he said. “Wouldn’t fit.” Diana almost laughed, before she remembered she was mad at him. Then she noticed that the left side of his jaw was purple and swollen. It couldn’t be comfortable with the cowl. 
“How’s your—”  Batman brought his arm out from under his cape. He was holding a bouquet of long-stemmed roses. Diana stared.
“My rear end can’t possibly feel that wonderful,” she said.
“Last night,” he said, “ensured my cover for the next year and a half, minimum. That front page means parties I can skip out on. Debutantes I don’t have to date. Time I can spend beating up criminals instead of acting like a dim-witted fop.” He paused, then added, “And don’t sell your rear end short.”
Diana glared at him, but took the flowers. “I should hit you more often,” she said. The roses smelled lovely.
“You could try.”
“Tempting,” Diana said. “Do I get to tie you up first?” When he didn’t say anything, she looked up from the roses, expecting a patented Bat-glare. Instead, he looked stunned. Diana made a note to remember the moment. She’d never seen Batman flabbergasted before. “It’s a joke,” she said. “Laugh.”
~
He smirked at her. “You get invitations. Requests to speak. To be interviewed. To sign autographs. Offers for personal appearances.”
“Yes,” said Diana. The entire League got those. Most of them were politely declined with a form letter, although Batman’s were invariably shredded and dropped on Earth, to burn up in re-entry.
“Accept one.”
Diana looked at him keenly. Something in his voice gave her a dark suspicion. “Why,” she asked, “do I have the feeling that I already did?”
~
“It is my great pleasure to be here at—” Diana surreptitiously checked her notes “–the opening of the Camden, New Jersey Monster Truck Arena–-” Note to self: kill Batman. “ –which I hope will give joy to citizens for many years to come.”
~
“Ow,” said Clark’s voice in her ear. “It’s okay. I’m all right. Just a little buried.” He paused. “Er, can anybody tell me which way is up?”
~
His next turn is off-centre enough that he only sticks his landing because his body knows from experience that the alternative would hurt much, much more. 
~ That afternoon is possibly even more surreal than the thing with the Legion and the time-travelling teenage Clark and Darkseid. Or the volcano. It’s hard to tell if Tim is just really, really good at pretending to be a normal guy, but Kon also reckons that the amount of time Tim spends staring out the window is carefully calculated against some sort of national average. It’s American History, which is one of the things Cadmus thought was really essential to plant in his brain as some kind of innate knowledge, so it’s okay for Kon to stare out the window as well, and besides, then he can watch Tim. Kon’s notes for this class consist of the following: “Tuesday 7th. Roosvelt - new deal & 30s. chapter 12 p76-85. clone? double? evil twin?—> need secret pasword or handshake for this shit. LL plan B? >:O (tim too smrt) tt prank? cassie wld kick ass. bm checking up on me. SM? (busy. also haha) tim = crazy? seems ok.” 
Halfway through Mr Ferguson’s drone about farm programs and the economy act two things dawn on Kon and make him grin. The first one is that barring some kind of mind control alien plot, that is actually his best friend sitting next to him in class. The second is that the last class they have is gym. And he’s going to kick Tim’s ass. ~
“Is this a bad time?” Tim asked meekly. “There’s ice cream in the freezer,” Barbara grumbled.  “You have thirty seconds to get it into my face, or I’ll kill you.”
~
“Hail, and well-met, gentle citizen!  You have reached the subterranean lair of—” “BART!” someone in the background screamed.  “ANSWER THE PHONE LIKE A REAL PERSON!” “... Crandall residence, bart speaking.”
~
“PHEW!  Jeez, this thing smells like Big Barda.” 
Tim made a mental note to himself that rubbing a letter through six different magazine perfume samples was not an accurate way to simulate the fragrance of a female.  Unless said female was Big Barda.
~
She glanced around the table for something else to throw at him, and then stole his fork instead.
“Ha,” Tim replied smugly.  “I’ve got four more.  Not that I know what any of them do, but I’m got four more.”
~ The part of him that reacts to being on edge is telling him that he needs more space to move, that Kon should be in the front and to the side to provide a shield without impeding movement, that Cassie should be at least 5 metres away so she can make better use of her lasso. ~ “Didn’t you leave him a note or something?” “Yeah. It says we’re at the library.” “Well, that’s stupid! Why’d you go and say that?” “Because the point of this was to do something on our own, remember? What was I supposed to do? Dear Batman, Sneaking out to fight crime on my own. If not back by eleven, come rescue me. P.S. It was Kid Flash’s idea.” “Oh, come on. I was perfectly okay with going to a movie; you’re the one who had to spot the guy in the weird green suit coming in here.” ~ “Maybe we should try Plan H.” “I hate Plan H.” “Me too, but we’re getting closer and closer to being sidekick croutons.” “I’m going to be grounded for the rest of my life,” Dick mutters, but Wally hears when he takes a deep breath, matches it, and then they’re both yelling “Help!” as loud as they can. It’s humiliating. ~ “It’s pea-soup,” Wally exclaims. “What the hell kind of villains do you guys have here anyway? Who tries to kill you with soup?”They’re in danger of drowning in a winter lunch-time staple, but that’s about it, and Wally’s not going to have his tombstone say “Bested by Soup.” ~
“You were a welcome diversion, I assure you. And I could hardly ignore you when you crashed bleeding through my window, and apologised to me for the inconvenience!” ~
“I don’t think there are people in this business with normal families,” Tim replied while keeping an eye on the street below. He used to, but then his mom was killed—still, at least he had his father. He was the only one of the entire Bat crew with a living birth parent. Bruce was an orphan, Dick was an orphan, Jason was an orphan, Cass was adopted or stolen or something, and even Oracle wasn’t Jim Gordon’s biological daughter. Bart was from the future and had only his grandmother, while Kon didn’t have any parents at all—unless you counted Superman, which Tim didn’t. 
“Superman,” Jason said. 
“Superman was put in a ship as a baby and fired at Earth.”

Arthur breaks through the crowd by sheer intimidation; he’s good at it, and he doesn’t have to enjoy snivelling subservience to recognize that it has its uses.
~ Arthur takes a second to study a filthy, bruised, and uncharacteristically belligerent Merlin, a grim Gaius, and the son of the second highest noble in the land, who Arthur’s privately called Pustilius for so long that it’s an effort to stop himself from doing so now.
~ “Do not speak to me or I will flog you myself. Unless, of course, you feel you are about to die and rob me of the privilege of ending your sorry excuse for a life.”
~
Merlin’s mouth opens, then shuts tight, and it’s post-Midsummer all over again, but this time, there’s nothing for Merlin to clean in malicious obedience. All he can do is stand there and radiate disdain while wrapped in a blanket.
~ While Gwen would never so forget herself as to express reproach, he really has no idea what to call that expression that isn’t quite what one would call respectful.
~
“They ran away or you ate them or something. The stories were never clear, but I understand their ghosts haunt the armoury. Have you—have you even taken this off since you left? It’s buckled completely wrong.” Merlin’s fingers slide between leather and the chafed skin of Arthur’s wrist. “I didn’t know you could do this to metal.”
~ Uther spent his life trying to prove himself King. Arthur simply was.
~ For a second, Lois just looked at him. “Yes, Perry. That’s what it is.” She fluttered her hands upwards in the air, “You solved the big mystery. I caught the flu. You know; that well-known strain where it doesn’t make you sick in any way, you just suddenly forget where you were for three days straight.”
~
“Whoa. Okay, seriously, we planning on raiding a small country?”
The table is covered with guns and ammunition. Sierra isn’t doing this half-assed, and merely lifts one eyebrow to his look, and slides her gaze back to the rifle. “Grab the MG36 from storage, would you? I need to clean the guns.”
“We’re supposed to be going in light and efficient.”
She flashes him a flirty smile. “I can do heavy and efficient.”
He smirks. “You know, when you say stuff like that, I get distracted by dirty thoughts.”
“You get dirty thoughts when I walk through the door,” she accuses.
“It’s not my fault! You have this little wiggle to your hips. It’s like you’re teasing me when you do that. And other things. Like breathing.”
~
Arthur had set up a complex system of multi-coloured files in his room for exams, arranging them artfully over the desk and floor and propping them against the wall by the balcony. Merlin had learned his lesson about moving them the hard way. Now he navigated on tip-toes across the papers to Arthur’s bed, and manoeuvred his way out in the mornings, eyes half-closed, by keeping his back pressed to the opposite wall. Arthur asked to be quizzed, sometimes, on dates and authors—he had a series of notecards to rival the most meticulous librarian—and other times he demanded that Merlin listen to what sounded like rants about injustice or animal imports but apparently were answers to neutral questions like, Discuss the significance of changing settlement patterns in 8th century England.
~
“Merlin, hello. I’m calling about carnations,” she said, sounding as if she’d been up for hours doing terribly efficient things.
“Carnations?” asked Merlin. He was slowly inuring himself to the thought that he would always be slower than Morgana by at least a factor of five, particularly before his morning tea. “For Arthur,” she said, her breath coming quickly as if she were jogging to the Chemistry faculty, or maybe saving clutches of orphans from harm. Fast. “For Ar—oh, carnations,” said Merlin, finally cottoning on and glancing down at his hand, where a faded CARN was still visible from where he’d nearly washed off the biro. He’d meant to go to the covered market on Saturday, but had managed to forget because he’d been wearing a jumper all day that had sleeves that went down to his fingers, and today was his last chance to get the flowers before Arthur’s exams.

“Only if you get vegetarian things this time, Arthur. And no, pork and leek sausages do not count because they have ‘vegetable bits’ in them.”
~ It was Lancelot who came up with it, of course, because the minute that man thought of anything silly he immediately became enamoured of it, and wouldn’t let up until it had been seen through. This tenacity was what had led to the great Second-Year Banana Costume Incident at the Wadham bop, to which no-one made reference but which Merlin was fairly sure Morgana had documentation of, possibly in the form of sodding pictures that she probably kept in a bank safe in an underground lair.
~ Lancelot didn’t like to face serious conversations without appropriate musical accompaniment or props, which is why he’d dumped his last girlfriend at a Death Cab for Cutie concert and why Merlin still had a Valentine’s Day card that said, I’m bananas about you!, with Sorry written inside in Lancelot’s messy scrawl. It had been sent very shortly after that of which they did not speak.
~ “Loveyou,” he muttered, but only into Arthur’s shoulder, where Merlin had pressed his mouth with the express purpose of not being heard too clearly. Arthur tensed above him, but in a good way, and though he said nothing, his fingers pressed more tightly, more intimately, into Merlin’s hips and waist.
~ “It does that,” Lancelot was saying, pointing at the boiler cheerily as if bangs near gas-run appliances were simply a quirky departure from the drab monotony of the everyday.
~ Emily took a deep breath, bent down, and blew all the candles out with as much grace a lady can when her family has put two and a half boxes of birthday candles on her cake. When she caught her breath, she said, “They do have those number candles now.”
~ “Has Caroline met her yet?”
“Yes.” William waited for an answer. Charles said, “Since when have I ever followed dating tips from Caroline.”

Laser crosswalks are the crosswalks of the future. You can tell because it has ‘laser’ in the name. Pretty much anything with ‘laser’ in it is gonna be a huge hit in the future. Don’t believe me? Just stare at this laser eye-toy for a minute. Aaaaand now you’re blind.

Both Tony and Eli stretch towards her, arms outreached. “Do you need—”
“God help me, if either one of you says help, I swear I will start shooting.” Tony’s eyes flick towards Eli, who shakes his head subtly. I have her ammo, he mouths, but his eyes cut to a familiar spot on her hip, where the hilt of a knife protrudes from her pants. Tony sighs. Too risky, he mouths back, indicating the blade, and Eli shrugs, sinking back into his chair.
~ Sam smoothed his face into his sincere and earnestly honest expression, or his lying like a rug face if you listened to Dean, which Sam wouldn’t recommend to anyone as a life choice.
~  The Unfortunate Carousel was the life’s work of the regrettable Eighteenth Amir of Sarappa, who dedicated himself to creating the most lavish, elaborate, and grotesque carousel ever made. Carved by the finest artisans, inlaid with gems and precious metals, powered by experimental steam boilers and teams of bullocks, the genius of the Unfortunate Carousel was that it had no horses, but was instead made up of all of those beasts considered graceless, unlovely, unclean, and/or generally obnoxious. Rats and grackles cavorted alongside hippopotomi and squid, rhinos and jackals rode cheek-by-jowl with skunks and gila monsters. By the time it was finished, the Unfortunate Carousel rose two and a half stories, had cost forty-seven lives, driven two engineers mad, and brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy. Unfortunately, on the first occasion when the carousel was fired up, the main boiler exploded two minutes in, causing general carnage and untold havoc and completely destroying the machinery. The Amir’s plans to build a second, even more grandiose carousel were foiled when he was removed from power by an outraged peasantry wielding pitchforks and uninclined to discuss the finer points of carousel-making. Specimens from the Unfortunate Carousel have turned up in numerous collections in the following centuries, including this very fine white walrus figure, in the private collection of the Marquis of Widdlemark.
~ The other demons made fun of Throggle’s teddy bear, but he knew that one day, one glorious bloody day, Beelzebear would rise and destroy them all, then take its rightful place among the high lords of hell. On that day, Throggle would be generously rewarded for his devotion. And until then, it was nice to snuggle with. ~ Lesser Known Saints: 
Saint Azul is one of the patron saints of gardeners, who seem to require a lot of divine intervention as a group, since when you garden, you pretty much shove something in the ground, make it a little offering of water and fertilizer, and pray for a miracle. Azul is specifically the patron of bulbs, and is invoked by those who are trying to remember where exactly they planted those tulips, whether they’re supposed to take the irises up in fall or not, and whether or not they accidentally put the daffodils in upside-down. Medals of St. Azul buried in beds are believed to protect against incursions by moles and field mice.
Saint Barnaby didn’t like anybody. If this were a standard story of saints, he would have a conversion experience and become a friend to young and old alike, but it isn’t, and he didn’t. He didn’t like anybody, he was born not liking anybody, he went to his grave not liking anybody. Between those two events, however, he stood off three attacks by Huns on his monastery, more or less singlehandedly, because he didn’t like armed raiders any more than he liked anybody else. Since the monastery was being used to house the wounded from all those Hun attacks at the time, he became a minor patron saint of hospitals and nurses, although he probably wouldn’t have liked people praying to him anymore than he liked anything else. Dodus, (of the Mauritian Doduses) was a zealot. He believed that he was right, and all other faiths that deviated one iota were wrong. Unfortunately, he didn’t keep very good notes, so what Dodus may actually have believed is lost to history. What is known is that upon receiving word that an enemy sect was approaching the town, without waiting for further details and with visions of forced conversions dancing in his head, St. Dodus climbed out an eighth story window and hurled himself to his death, thus becoming the first and only person ever to be martyred by Unitarian Universalists. The Unitarians felt just awful about the whole thing and had him beatified by way of apology, after which there was coffee and cookies. He is not the patron saint of anything, but a medal of St. Dodus worn around the neck is said to warn off hugs from well-meaning strangers. Saint Heronius was a marauding warlord of the eleventh century, famed for the unspeakable atrocities committed upon his foes. Then one night, at the age of thirty, he had a vision of the Lord in the form of a flaming yo-yo, renounced his evil ways, and dedicated himself and his men to good works. This lasted for about two months, whereupon the local populace, completely unable to deal with all the brigands who were trying to help them weed gardens, milk cows, and abducting little old ladies in order to help them across streets (the nearest street being some twenty miles distant, the toll on little old ladies was immense) rose up en masse and massacred the lot of ‘em. Cruelly martyred by angry little old ladies, St. Heronius, for no reason that anyone can determine, is now the patron of young lovers and cheesemongers. Saint Mellivora is an ancient African saint, the roots of which are obscure and poorly documented. He is usually portrayed bearing the Miraculous Sausage, but alas, the story behind it has been lost to the ages, and no one is quite sure what kind of sausage it was, or what exactly was so miraculous about it. Not surprisingly, St. Mellivora is the patron of sausage-makers, as well as beekeepers and, for some reason, professional dowsers. Bratwurst makers, however, eschew the worship of St. Mellivora in favor of St. Ungo the Well-Endowed, for reasons that we will not get into here.
The lesser-known St. Snargus was martyred at the age of forty-one, owing to a tragic fishing incident. Having caught a fish larger than his companion, Snargus would not stop claiming that his fish was THIS big. Unfortunately for Snargus, his fishing companion was a pagan emperor who was generally not a bad sort, but intensely humorless about his fishing. When Snargus refused to shut up, or to recant his statement about the length of the fish, the emperor had both the saint and the fish were burned at the stake. Both were later beatified. St. Snargus is thus the patron of anglers and looks with special favor upon those whose fishing companions leave something to be desired.
St. Ungo the Well-Endowed is possibly unique in the history of hagiography, in that he was beatified based on the testimony of eighty-six different women,* who all claimed that yes, definitely, miraculous, hoo boy, you have NO idea, seriously, without ever saying exactly what the miracle in question had been. This has baffled researchers for centuries. Today St. Ungo is the patron of single women and, apparently demonstrating the cryptic and arbitrary nature of sainthood, bratwurst.
St. Wombus, a little known saint of the late middle ages, achieved fame and beatification for what came to be known as the Miracle of the Zucchini. Namely, there was only ever the ONE zucchini. This feat, a sort of vegetable inversion of the loaves and fishes, was so astonishing and obviously counter to nature that Wombus was beatified at once. His blessing is sought by gardeners who have foolishly overplanted. An icon of St. Wombus, buried upside down in the vegetable patch, is believed to keep most members of the squash family at manageable levels. ~ The Actuarial Snails of Eastthorp spend their lives worrying that something dreadful will happen. They live in a constant state of anxiety, fearing predators, disasters, and social ineptitude, and then they worry about the toll this anxiety is taking on their tiny invertebrate hearts and stomach linings. As a defense mechanism, in order to get anything done, they have therefore evolved the ability to figure out exactly what the odds of any given dreadful thing happening, to six decimal places. This allows them to go about their normal lives relatively unconcerned about things like meteors or rogue wildebeests, while still flinching and sliming madly for cover whenever a snailhawk passes over head. As a result of this peculiar skill, the Actuarial Snails have been hunted extensively for the accounting trade, where they are kept in large, well-appointed terrariums and given all the office supplies they can eat. Almost all major corporations have an all-snail bookkeeping staff, and employ keen-eyed typographers to transcribe the tiny snailscript into invoices that their customers can read. While increasingly rare in the wild, the Actuarial Snails have crunched the numbers and found that far fewer dreadful things happen in their nice terrariums, and so are, by and large, fairly content.

“I wasn’t gonna laugh.”
Um-huh. Sure. Sam’s totally not buying it. “So when the judge tells you that he was groped by Bigfoot-” Dean snickers at that. It was unintentional, but Sam believes he’s made his point. 
~
Sam’s hands move as though he’s trying to explain with them. “It’s more like an endangered species.”
~ Almost reflexively, he has Merlin by the front of his shirt and he says, “How dare you even – “ and he swings them around, pushing Merlin against the wall instead, harder than he probably deserved, but frankly that’s the least of Arthur’s worries; because the rational part of his brain hiding behind the blanket of white-hot range is telling him that there’s no reason for him to do this, for him to be standing here, why is he still standing here, why is he standing right up against Merlin and not moving backwards and why isn’t Merlin pushing him away and why are they just standing and breathing and staring at each other, because—And this is where Arthur kisses Merlin very forcefully and very very angrily. When Arthur looks back on this, he thinks: perhaps it is some kind of instinctual human thing, because he has a mouth, and Merlin has a mouth, and they were very close together, and there is no other way out of that situation. Although sometimes, in very occasional fits of clarity, Arthur thinks his own theories can be pretty fucking moronic.
~ Merlin had come back covered in tomatoes and cabbage and Arthur didn’t really want to know what else, and bowed flamboyantly low to him, and said, permission to have a wash before I clean your riding boots, sire, or else they’re going to contain more vegetables than usual. Permission granted, said Arthur, and felt himself starting to smile, and saw Merlin start to smile back. So he fixed his expression and said, don’t take too long, will you, and then turned away.
~ “I would give anything in this world to hate you,” says Arthur, eventually. Merlin smiles. “That’s almost sweet.”
~ They had two days to prepare, which was more than enough, considering that all any of them really had to do was show up and be armed.

“What?” Dean looked disgusted. “No, why would I think that?”
“Because we’re here to catch a werewolf, so I don’t see how the blonde is relevant.”
~ “Can you show me? You know.” The man made an imprecise gesture. The Doctor hadn’t the faintest clue what he was talking about.
~ “I told you, you have something of the wolf about you, and I didn’t want to tip the lupine-wavelength haemovariform off.”
“What’d you find out?”
The Doctor sighed. “You have a lot of the wolf about you. I think he’s already been tipped off.”
~ “There’s a werewolf around here,” Dean answered.
“Yes,” snapped the Doctor. “And it’s obviously not us; we’re standing here in moonlight.”
There was a moment, and then Dean lowered the gun and looked at the man standing next to him. “It’s a good point.”
~ Marcy, from tickets and information, always said that he just looked like a nerd with a stick and that his fascination with wooden bats was the second creepiest thing that she’d ever seen. When Jacob had asked her what the first one was and Marcy showed him the Greek exhibition, he had to agree that she was absolutely right.
~ “It was the satyrs,” the man answered. Straight faced, like he hadn’t said the most ridiculous thing ever.
“Maybe we could go out the window?” The guy gave him a pointed look and for some reason, Jacob actually felt embarrassed, like somehow he was being measured and had fallen short of whatever expectations and goals had been set there. Which was all kinds of ridiculous. Except for the fact that they were on the fifth floor... and there were iron bars on all the windows... and yeah, the guy might have a point.

“Unless you were in a coma.  And I don’t remember you ever being in a coma.  But maybe I was in a coma while you were in a coma.  Except I couldn’t have worked at Hoffman if I was in a coma.”

~ Should you get a kitten or an adult cat? This is just making the choice between whether the cat already hates you now or will hate you later. Also, not all cat hatred is the same. It can range from passive aggressive hatred to spastic surly hatred.

“God, the panic in your eyes, Jess.” He does the voice again. “Leave it on.” Then slaps his thigh in unrestrained glee. “You were so freaking out.”
~ “Okay, listen, I don’t have either the energy or the interest required to spend time making your life miserable as you learn your proper place in the Academy food chain. Also, I am quite sure that you will have sufficient other sources of abject humiliation and despair to develop the necessary soul-crushing self-doubt. Therefore, these are the rules. Memorize them, obey them, and we shall get on quite fine. Flaunt them at any point and I will rent you out to someone who will enjoy making you whimper like a baby. But, just because I am disinclined to waste my valuable and increasingly rare free time coming up with ways to humiliate you does not give you liberty to act as though you are not subject to my whims and pleasures. Certainly not for the first semester and preferably not for the entirety of your Fourthie year. There will be times when I will be required to demonstrate my control over you and you will comply without hesitation. Failure to do so will result in genuine and frequent acts of capricious cruelty. Do not mistake my rationality with compassion or friendship – this is a relationship of convenience and it can either be convenient for both of us or none of us. The choice will be up to you.”

“And how is it my fault you were speeding?” said Rusty. “You had two jobs—cut the power to the block and drive the getaway car. The getaway car is not supposed to get pulled over. Also, the power came back on.”
~ It’s Caradoc that roars from beneath a frothy upper lip that they’ve got to have a picture; there’s collective eye-rolling because of course Caradoc would want to document the moment, all of them with eyes glazed and clothing rumpled, only a Welshman would think it was a picture-perfect moment, but they humor him because he waves the camera with such fevered excitement that he nearly knocks Hagrid over—no easy feat, even when sober. So they clamour over to the mantle and somehow manage to gather together in a semi-organized bundle; there’s some squabbling when Dedalus refuses to remove his stupid hat, and again when Elphias proudly declares that if Diggle gets to wear his, than he’s keeping the purple bowler on. Which of course leads to Marlene Transfiguring a seat cushion into the most ridiculous cap she can imagine…
~ It’s eggplant and tripe, Ginny’s favourite, which elicits a chorus of boos and mimed vomiting from her brothers, but Molly silences them with a glare and Arthur loyally announces that he’s been craving tripe since Christmas. (Ginny gratefully pretends not to notice him holding his breath as he takes his first bite.)
~ “No, Harry,” the man says, and Kirmani reclassifies him from Unknown to Dresden’s Friend, “that won’t do it all. There’s a second edition in that ridiculously dilapidated trunk you insist on keeping stuffed full and under the bed; you’re far more likely to find an intact entry in there. I don’t see why you insist on using the seventh edition.” “Because it’s far less likely to explode in a pile of dust and ink if I touch it?”
~ “For the record, I was kinda drunk and arguing with Brad – who we both know brings out the confrontational side of anyone. I’m pretty sure I’ve even seen you roll your eyes at him, which is the normal person equivalent of wishing him dead. He’s just so smug.”

“You can’t scoop me that easily, Smallville. I have the internet on my phone.”

“Now, wait. Have you seen my cookware?” Tony countered. “I have cookware made of copper. Just like— guess who else?— that’s right: Martha Stewart. Everything you cook in that stuff turns to cuisine, Potts, mi amor. Hey, and additionally, your name is practically a culinary degree. I don’t know why we haven’t discussed this before.”
~ “Jarvis never gets the cheese right,” Tony said, gesturing dismissively.  “‘Good burnt’ and ‘bad burnt’ are insufficient descriptors,” came Jarvis’s voice from the door panel, sounding pained. “See?” Tony said, reasonably, and started unbuttoning his shirt. “Do you know how to play Go Fish?”
~
“Pietro Evaristo. Upon approaching the subject for questioning he...” she struggled for words. “Turned into a bat thing and tried to eat your face?” I suggested. “Resisted arrest and in the ensuing confrontation, was—” “—killed by a bullet from Detective Kirmani’s gun,” I filled in. “You didn’t kill him, Sid,” Connie objected. “No, but I don’t think we can say Dresden staked him through the heart, either,” I pointed out.

“Primitive tattoos like the ones on the victims are often made with paper clips or even staples. And by ‘primitive’ I don’t mean tattoos made by indigenous people. I mean tattoos that aren’t done by professionals. Like prison tattoos.Although many tattoo artists in prison are able to reach a pretty amazing level of proficiency. Some are even able to rig up machines like those used in tattoo parlors. They …”
Hotch raised a finger at Reid, who subsided immediately. “Garcia?”
“The shape of the punctures,” she repeated, “seems to suggest a paper clip that’s been sharpened to a point.” The smile in her voice carried clearly over the phone. “Score another one for Dr. Reid.”
“Is there any chance it’s some sort of super special paperclip that’s only sold in a couple of locations around the country?” Emily asked hopefully.
“Not so much,” Garcia answered.
“It had to be asked,” Prentiss told Morgan solemnly when he grinned at her.

“This is as good a time as any, and you’re going to get real friendly with each other over the next two weeks, so you should know each other’s names. You! Name and favorite color.” “Uh,” says the guy who called the instructor ‘dude’. “Gary, Gary Mitchell, sir. Silver.”
“Good, well done, Garygary Mitchellsir. You next.”

Hardison paused, “Wait, four ways—” “I’m not cutting off my leg,” Neal said flatly. “Three ways,” Hardison confirmed

“Finals are over and I have a life again. I hear those are very popular among other people.”

“My name’s Potter,” Harry said, and tried to look as un-Prophesied and un-Chosen as possible. “Harry Potter.”
~
But he looked satisfied; the bastard really did like being right. Which was, Harry thought ruefully, probably why he’d never gotten married.
~
“Well, well. I believe you are dead in this world.” ‘Believe’ sounded to Harry an awful lot like ‘know for a fact, as I killed you myself and cackled madly over your wee little Chosen corpse’, but that could have just been paranoia on his part. 
~
Harry was a little worried by the light of interest in her stare. Damn it, he was supposed to be uninteresting. He’d deliberately crafted about the most boring persona ever. Trust a Slytherin to try and read depth and complexity into Harry’s idea of the epitome of dullness.
~
“What is this…Starbucks?” Dolohov asked curiously, earning himself a warning glance from Voldemort—but not an Unforgivable, which Harry found quite interesting, before the question registered and his mind went horribly blank. Starbucks was, well, Starbucks. Explaining a chain of Muggle coffee shops to a pack of pureblood wizards would be like explaining the desert to school of dolphins.
“Starbucks. Think about it: star bucks. Mutant deer from space. Very common in our dimension,” James said easily. Which was bad enough, but then he added, “Natural enemies of the Cylons.”
And Al, dear sweet intelligent Al, went and added, “Starbucks are also known for being bizarrely fond of cigars and alcohol and personal drama. Ironically, though they’re called ‘bucks’, they’re actually the females of their species. We call the males Apollos.”
“Oh, those lovable mutant space deer,” James sighed. Voldemort and his lackeys strove to remain expressionless, some of them going so far as to nod sagely, like the boys’ explanation sounded perfectly reasonable and not at all like a pile of steaming mutant space deer defecation. Harry decided none of his children were ever watching television again. Ever.

Sam, knowing the exact reason why Dean’s favourite superpower is x-ray vision, rolls his eyes and flips a page. “You’re such a perv.” “Dude. Do people call Superman a perv? No. They call him a hero. I’d be a hero,” Dean says. He adds dreamily, “I’d rescue those college coeds from all those darn clothes they have to wear all the time.”
~
“It’s hard to explain, Sammy. The car—” He hesitates, searching for words. “It’s like— When I’m sinking—” He stops. “Change that. It’s impossible to explain. So quit asking.” Sam just looks at him. He hates that look. Sam’s capable of just sitting there looking at him for the whole fucking night, knowing that eventually Dean will cave.
~ “Looks like they finished digging up the grave, but now they’re having another argument.”
“Shawn, don’t you think that if the phrase ‘finished digging up the grave’ is part of the sentence that’s it’s time to call the police?”

“More of a reversal situation than irony, Hotch. There’s nothing inherently contradictory in our actions from our words,” Reid said. “Although, if you were aiming for a literary definition of irony, I suppose this could be ironic in that the men we arrested for murder are actually innocent and now protecting us. Though I fail to see how JJ, Prentiss, and Rossi would fit in.” 
Hotch knew from long experience that further attempts to clarify would result in lectures on the importance of word choice, so he simply nodded his head in time with Reid’s pauses and continued to watch the door.
~ “It was named by the Cherokee. But monsters aren’t exactly specific about who they attack. We use the Cherokee name ‘cause it’s best described in Cherokee stories.”

Morgan paced the room. “Bastard won’t give up a thing. Two hours in the box and all I could get out of him was a few dirty limericks.” “In his defense,” Prentiss said, “those were pretty good limericks.”

“All of them. Like, the world.” Logan made a sweeping gesture.

“Actually, it’s not that I dislike women. I merely mistrust them. The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup.”

“There is something missing from my desk…dust! You’ve been tidying up against my explicit orders, Mrs. Hudson. Dust is an essential part of my filing system. By the thickness of it I can date any document immediately.”
“Don’t be ridiculous. It was this thick,” she said, holding her thumb and forefinger up to demonstrate.
“Hmm, by that, I’d say March 1893…the fifteenth, to be exact.”

“Look at this, an urgent missive to find missing midgets. Apparently, they’re not only midgets but also anarchists.”

“I only indulge in narcotics when I am suffering from extreme boredom.”

“Fabulous woman that. They say twelve men have died for her. Six committed suicide, four were killed in duels and one fell out of the gallery at the Vienna opera house because of her performance.”
“That’s only eleven.”
“The man who fell out of the gallery fell on another man in the orchestra.”
~
“Here, amuse yourself while I interview the suspect. They have vodka, caviar, girls…”
“No, thank you.”
“No girls?”
“No caviar. It makes me break out in hives.”
~
“How can you say it’s a figment of my imagination when for years you’ve been saying that I have no imagination whatsoever?”
~ “Getting Dean to court?” Sam continued, “That was my plan. You wanna know what Dean’s plan was? Summon a ghost in the lawyer’s house and then get rid of it, hero-like, save the day, get ‘em to back off. Biggest I-told-you-so-ever.”
~ Spock waits exactly 12.2 seconds before refusing the Vulcan Science Academy’s offer of admission. Making his choice takes 1.2 of those seconds. Recognizing that it conflicts with logic requires 5.4. In 2.5 seconds, he concludes that he does not care what logic dictates, and he waits an additional 3.1 seconds to insure that his voice betrays no sign of the anger he cannot quite suppress. When he says, “then I must decline,” what he really means is “fuck you.”
~
“Okay,” Merlin admitted after a moment of silence in which Arthur eyed him suspiciously and Merlin fidgeted. “I didn’t exactly save your life. More like, prevented you from dying a horrible slow death from exposure and drowning and bleeding to death and probably getting eaten by large dangerous carnivorous forest animals too.”
~ “Oh,” he said. “You trust my instincts now.” “They may have been proven not entirely unreliable,” Arthur agreed.
~ “Merlin, you will wake up this second and you will not die! That is an order.” He sounded so angry that Merlin couldn’t help laughing. Or at least, he tried to, but it turned into a hacking cough that felt like his lungs being ripped apart, clawed to pieces from the inside out.
~
Then Merlin realised with a start, that was him. He was doing that. This was his magic and he hadn’t even noticed and how was he hiding them anyway because that would be a very handy spell to know?
~
Merlin ignored the comment and said, “Okay. Let us never speak of the undressing me thing ever again.” Arthur laughed and looked back at Merlin again and this time his mouth was set in what looked to Merlin disturbingly like a leer. “Oh but Merlin, your cold corpse-like skin was just so appealing.” Merlin actually stopped dead, clutching at a thin birch, and wondered if Arthur had been possessed. Or hit his head.  “Are you possessed?” Merlin asked. “Or did you hit your head? Because that was very creepy, and now let’s go back to talking about something else. Like hunting. You like hunting. We can talk about hunting.”
~
“We’re going to kill the evil thing,” Arthur nodded. “It’s such a simple plan that even you should be able to understand it.”
~
He heard the words of an enchantment and thought, Oh! I know this one!, then realised, And it’s going to kill me!
~ Arthur wobbled on his feet and sort of groaned but his eyes were fully open and almost focused so there was hope yet. Also, Arthur’s hand was still gripping the hilt of his sword tightly. Which was good because Arthur’s sword was integral to Merlin’s half-formed and slightly shoddy plan.
~ Oh, what a pair they made. Merlin imagined him and Arthur as a travelling jester-act; one would say, “I am the Prince Arthur Pendragon!”, and the other would say, “And I am his pathetic, misunderstood and oft ill-treated servant” and it really wouldn’t matter who played who. He imagined that they wouldn’t be very popular, and would probably spend a lot of time getting pelted by rotten vegetables.  The thought made him giggle and Arthur turned sharply to look at him. He stared at Merlin for a long moment then looked away, up at the sky, and said, “We should rest. Stop for the night.”
“I tell you I can barely breathe and you tell me to stop whining, but I giggle and you announce it’s time to stop?” he said, incredulous, and Merlin couldn’t understand why but he was suddenly so completely and utterly mad at Arthur that he could have hit him.  “It’s getting dark,” Arthur said, “And you never told me you couldn’t breathe. What you actually said was, ‘Arthur, mumble mumble mumble mumble’. What did you want me to say to that?”
~ “I totally knew it was zombies,” Shawn said. Gus eyeballed him scornfully.
“First you said it was a crazy cannibal serial killer like Hannibal Lector,” Gus said. “Then you said it was cannibal cultists seeking eternal youth. And then you said it was people infected with monkey-rage virus.”
~ Sam glared at Dean. “You couldn’t have broken it any more gently?” he hissed. Dean shrugged. “She wanted to know what was going on. Besides, how would you have explained it?” “Not like that,” Sam sputtered.
~
“Are you sure it wasn’t Mac?” said Logan. “‘Cause it sounded like a girl.”  “Definitely Wallace. Feel free to tease him about it later,” called out Veronica over her shoulder.
~
“Nope,” Dean says, shaking his head emphatically.  “Fuck mankind!” “And womankind,” Sam says, waggles a finger, trying to be fair and non gender-specific.  “Fuck womankind, too.” Dean cuffs him on the back of the head.  “What, I teach you nothin’, Sam?  You can fuck mankind – but you gotta make love to womankind.  Show the ladies some respec’, huh?”
~ Arthur made a face that suggested, simultaneously, that Merlin was an extreme idiot and that Arthur’s trials in life were very great, indeed. “What do you mean ‘what?’? I’m here to rescue you!”
~
“This is a horrible idea,” Merlin said sourly. “Did you even ask it?” he said after a moment, because sometimes Arthur forgot those little niceties when he was making plans.  “The dragon was the one who suggested it,” Arthur said cheerfully. “Is that so?” Merlin said, and if he didn’t know better, he’d think the dragon was attempting to look innocent and failing miserably

“Mr Darcy never talks to the men who pay you attention. He only glowers at them menacingly.”
“I assure you that it is true. He said, ‘Pass the salt, please,’ and ‘Thank you’. He did not even growl. He said it all politeness.”

“Old enough to be fretting about men.”
“There is more than one? This is getting worse by the minute! That is it. I am sending her to a nunnery.”
~ “I would like to bash their heads in for daring to look at you and then I would like to thank them for being stupid enough to let you go.”
~ “Excuse me?” he said. No harm in starting off polite. “Do I know you?” From the guns, apparently polite was the wrong approach.
~ Aeryn was instantly moving, positioning herself between him and his assailant, pulse pistol drawn and levelled in the general vicinity of the man’s nose. John appreciated the action, but it wasn’t necessary. He didn’t even have to look to know that his assailant wouldn’t pursue— not yet. He’d stand proudly in the centre of the room, waiting for Crichton to stagger to his feet and face him. There was, after all, a proper procedure to these sorts of things. 
D’Argo’s hand was on his arm. “John, are you all right?” 
“Sure, D, just peachy. What can you tell me about this guy?” 
D’Argo looked up, assessed Krall, then met John’s gaze earnestly. “He’s very large.” 
“Thanks a hell of a lot. Anything useful?” 
~
“You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?” Voldemort asked softly.
“I’ve been taught to drop my wand and summon snakes,” Harry replied. “Our duelling club was kind of substandard.”

“He’s nearly your parents’ age. I didn’t know they could still do it when they got that old.” Harry looked up. “Hey, Ron, d’you think your parents still—”
“Thank you very much. I’m scarred for life now.”
“I’m just saying.”
“I’m just going to go poke out my eyes.”
~ It all started with a banana peel. Well, technically, it ended with a banana peel. The Doctor’s eleventh incarnation, that is. It ended quite spectacularly with him slipping on one. Which was embarrassing enough in and of itself, but when coupled with an inconveniently timed backfiring car, a setting of Main Street, Sunnydale, and one frightened pedestrian calling the police, the situation became simply ridiculous. Because, really, he sincerely doubted that anyone else had ever been arrested for their own murder. Picking idly at the blood crusted onto the shoulder of his, now slightly too small, jacket, the Doctor cast an eye towards the police officer sitting across from him. He stared stonily back at the Doctor, with the look in his eyes of a man who knows he’s got a criminal in front of him, and is determined to bring him to justice.
~ Shawn nodded at the hacker in recognition and then held up his hand in a V, “Hey, live long and prosper dude.”
“Seriously? I don’t … what do you tell people about me?” 
“Nothing that ain’t true,” Eliot shrugged, sitting at the table.
“Can I see your elf costume later?” Shawn asked in an excited whisper as he sat on Hardison’s other side.
~ So inside of a month or so, Donna has built the Sam Winchester Demonic Power Amplifier (with custom-designed Ruby Shutoff), which allows Sam to eradicate demons en masse from miles away just by frowning thoughtfully.

“Scrabble? What kind of a game is this? The whole point of being a wizard is that you never have to learn spelling. There are quills for that.”

Or the time you got drunk and snogged Moony in the loo after—” “I,” said Sirius slowly, “did not snog Moony. He’d drank too much, and he wasn’t breathing, and—” “—and I’ve never seen a rennerverate that required that much tongue.”

And earns her both a full Lieutenant’s stripes and a dressing down from the captain for attempting to change the laws of physics without clearing it with him and Mr Spock first.
~ “I could’ve taken him,” Sam said, washing a paw with great deliberation.  “You could not! You were all—” Dean-kitten puffed his fur out to twice his size and hissed, “and he was all barking and drooling, and I was all—” Dean yowled and clawed at the air in front of him, “and then he was all ‘Yipeyipeyipe!’” Dean bounced around on the bed.
~ Four pillows to two grown men – one taller than average thank you very much and one giant-sized – isn’t really the greatest pillow-to-person ratio ever. In the end, after a bit of squabbling and some shaky attempts at laying bedclothes as foundations, they’re pretty much lying on the bed with a pillow-tent balanced precariously over their heads and their limbs tucked into weird, intimate places. In this context, when Dean says ‘pretty much’, what he means is ‘exactly that.’
“This is a pretty lame fort, man,” Sam says, eventually.  “Screw you,” Dean says. “This is the best pillow fort ever.”
~ “No,” Kirk said, because he was a guy with priorities. “I am not leaving this jail cell until I receive a fist bump.”
~ “It’s nice to finally meet you, John. I hear that you are the future messiah. I’m Sam Winchester. I used to be the antichrist.”
~
So yeah, maybe that’s the thing that’s really bugging him about this whole praying bullshit: that he can know how Sam holds his fork to eat and the motion he uses when dragging a brush through his straggly, too-long hair and the way the little toe on his left foot has a small kink it, but not know when Sam lost his faith in Dean to save him.

Premise: Jeeves & Batman
“I say Jeeves, it’s these criminals!”  “Criminals, sir?”  “Yes, Jeeves, criminals! You know, lawbreakers. Hoods and the like. They’re becoming rather... well, rather problematic, especially after that dreadful business in Crime Alley.”  “Crime and bad lives are the measure of a state’s failure, sir.”  “Quite so, Jeeves, quite so! One of yours?”  “It is the sentiment of the novelist Wells, sir.”  “Right ho, and well he is to think it. If only there were some way to... well, to strike back at the bally crooks, eh what?”  “If I may, sir?”  “Of course, old man, of course. Put the old grey matter to it at once.”  “It has been said that criminals, sir, are a superstitious and cowardly lot.”  “Superstitious?”  “And cowardly, sir. Perhaps if you were to disguise yourself as a horrifying creature, you could turn those fears against them.”  “A horrifying creature? You mean like Aunt Agatha?”  “Perhaps something more predatory than Mrs. Gregson, sir.”  “You can think of something more predatory than Aunt Agatha?”  “Perhaps a bat, sir.”  “A bat?”  “Yes, sir.”  “I say. A bat. That does have potential, Jeeves. That does have potential indeed.”  “Yes, sir.”

“So, you’re Lucifer too, hmm?” Dean asked, his shaky voice doing little for the fear inside. “How many versions do you have?”  “We are legion,” he offered with a benign smile.

“Why don’t you have a boyfriend, hon?” her grandfather asked.
“I’m a free spirit.”
“What she means is she’s a whore,” her grandmother muttered. 
~ “You know,” Gus couldn’t resist pointing out, “if you weren’t friends with criminals, you wouldn’t have to worry about them being spotted.”
~
“Maybe I just called to hear your voice.” 
“Oh, then let me forward you to my voicemail and you can listen to me tell you I’ll get back to you at my earliest possible convenience as much as you’d like and I can go back to sleep.”
~ She’s fairly certain that he’s just about the most unprofessional captain that Starfleet has ever employed, a fact which is cemented in her mind the day after the Christmas party, when he stumbles into the bridge in just his undershorts and socks and asks blearily, “So that we’re clear, did I vomit on Spock last night, or just near him?”
~
Uhura is beautiful, and smart, and more terrifying than anyone else on the ship because she has this way of looking at you like she’s imagining stabbing you in the eyes. It’s a look she reserves mostly for the Captain and Scotty, though Rand sees it thrown Dr. McCoy’s way a couple of times and Sulu gets it once for tentatively asking if he could buy her a drink.
Rand never gets it, because Rand’s not fucking stupid, so she knows how not to piss the translator off.
~
On the one hand, she’s totally supposed to report it because fraternization on the ship is technically against regulations. On the other, writing a report would require a) getting close enough to figure out who it actually is, and b) writing the words make out on an official document, and Rand’s just not comfortable doing either one of those things.
~
Uhura is passing the time by reading the writing scratched out on the wall. When Scotty asks her to translate, she replies in a deadpan, “One upon a time there was a crew of idiots who thought it would be funny to go to the beach on a hostile planet. They were all kidnapped and killed, except the beautiful translator who they worshipped as their queen. The end.”
Rand wonders who found these people and broke their normal reactions to terrifying situations bone.
“You know,” Scotty mutters thoughtfully, “since we’re going to die anyway, Uhura…”
“No,” she says flatly.
“Now’s not the time,” Sulu snaps sharply, and Rand smiles gratefully at him, because at least someone has their priorities in order. Then he covers his eyes. “I wouldn’t want to see that. God, Scotty, the thought of you actually … mmph. I think I just vomited in my mouth, a little bit.”
~ He believed that an old map he found proved the Aztec priests removed most of their gold—before Cortes arrived—and took it to Utah for reasons best described as “making the opposite of sense.”
~ “You will notice that at no point did we say this was a good idea, just a new and exciting one.”
~ But sometimes those self-service lanes are full, or broken, or maybe the goddamn thing just will not scan the UPC code on your bag of potatoes correctly and, rather than giving you the perfectly reasonable “fuck these potatoes” option, they automatically flag down an employee for you, thus forcing you to chat with someone who was considered too socially unappealing for a job as a checkout boy.

“When are you going to stop making Cylon toast, Sheldon?”

“Eight. I’m out of 409.” she noted
~ Sam later decides Dean’s only criterion for his kids is that they be badasses, and that Dean also believes that being a badass can be taught to anyone under the age of five who has puppy-dog eyes. Which honestly seems pretty counter-intuitive to Sam, but then he knows he kind of has puppy-dog eyes, and he’d like to think he can be a badass.
~
Sam says “guardian” or “caregiver” most of the time, but Dean never fails to classify Sam as Charlie’s mother. Sam knows he’s the less-favoured parent, but that’s because he’s the one who makes Charlie eat his vegetables and go to school and enforces a strict no-guns-til-you’re-fifteen rule.

“You go too far, sir. I will not stand for it.”
“Then sit down.”
~ Ordinarily, Jeeves manages to divine when I have awoken by some arcane method, likely of a kind man was Not Meant To Know. It is a settled thing that within two minutes of the resurrection I can anticipate my tea coming into the room, ready to do its part in the getting of one Bertram Wooster from the horizontal to the vertical state.
~ The sun was pouring enthusiastically into the room, rather overdoing it in my opinion.
~
I mean to say, take a girl for instance, you had better be dashed careful not to neglect her or one morning she will have sailed for the colonies with a millionaire, and there you are, in the soup… supposing of course that your heart was really in it, and you were not secretly wishing to be well-shot of the whole business.
~ It has occasionally been said, usually by my Aunt Agatha, that I have not much self-assertion, and it is deuced unfair of her, too, as whenever I give it a try on any of her proposals she is quick as a rabbit to put a stop to it. But in the present occasion I defy even Aunt Agatha to quarrel with the degree of assertion displayed by self.
~ Mr. Jessup, as my stalwart companion was called, expressed the opinion we were in imminent danger of being taken up, but upon my persuasive arguments (another fiver, as well as assurances that any policeman would blame me for the entire enterprise, while he could pass himself off as a groundskeeper long enough to whiffle off), agreed to boost me up to the balcony. The rest proved remarkably straightforward, at least when one discounts the cat, the housemaid, and the fire, which was put out long before reaching any of the other residences on the street, and without injury to any of the inhabitants, though I have to call that a pity. Jessup and I went galloping away with a really ripe assortment out of the old rotter’s safe, after tipping him out the window to avoid said fire
~
Peter glances over at Neal in the passenger seat and smirks. Of the two of them, Peter is almost never the one that gets to employ the amused, slightly condescending smirk. He gives himself a tick mark on the scorecard of the ongoing battle to surprise Neal Caffrey.
~ Peter now hates Bolivia, which he’d been previously ambivalent about, and spends the whole meeting wanting to say: “You know the email you’ve gotten three times a week for the past two years, the one that claims you’ve inherited some money and all you have to do to claim it is send in your personal information and put down a small deposit, you know the one that has scammed thousands of people, if not more, out of a lot of money, you know that one? I JUST ARRESTED THAT GUY!” Peter and Neal spend the whole meeting exchanging looks every few minutes, saying “Can you believe this?” and “I know, seriously?” with their eyebrows.
~
Peter decides to barbeque, Neal puts aside his hat in favour of Elizabeth’s Don’t Make Me Poison Your Food apron, and Elizabeth bogarts the grill and only lets Peter and Neal make the salad. Peter tells Neal this is business as usual, and Neal assures him that he’s hurt and insulted on Peter’s behalf. Elizabeth makes an inappropriate gesture.
~ There is a small but crucial difference between briefings and meetings, which is that briefings include some of Peter’s bosses, and meetings include nothing but Peter’s bosses. Days that are eaten up by briefings and meetings are days that Peter doesn’t get to do any of the interesting work, which makes him cranky. Contributing to his crankiness is the fact that Neal had only had to attend one briefing.
~ It’s not that Hardison is a conspiracy theorist. He’s a hacker. He doesn’t need theories, he knows stuff. He knows all about Area 51. He knows about the area under Area 51 where they keep all the really cool shit. He knows about the six secret agencies that no one is supposed to know about. He even knows which celebrities in Hollywood are gay. And, okay, the last one might be because of his secret addiction to gossip sites because he had once been dared to break the code in a blind item and Hardison never backs away from a challenge even a really stupid one. And also, Hollywood studios have crappy security on their e-mails. The e-mails are practically jumping up and down screaming: Read me! Read me! Someone should look into that. The point being that Hardison doesn’t have to make up shit. If he’s curious about something, he finds out the answers. End of story. Except, okay, here’s the thing with Torchwood. Everyone has heard of them. They’re the worst concealed secret organization ever. They’re famous for it, but Hardison starts wondering if maybe that’s actually part of their plan because no one can be that bad at hiding themselves, so maybe they’re actually hiding the real secret organization under the glaringly obvious appallingly badly hidden secret agency.
~
“Aliens? What Aliens? :)”
“You are a grown man. You did not just use a smiley. I’m embarrassed for you and your secret organization. Also, everyone knows about the aliens. You guys suck at secrecy.”
“Maybe that’s what we want you to think. ;)”
“You’re killing me here. Incompetence is not an acceptable concealment strategy. And stop it with the smiley faces. It’s creeping me out.”
“It’s worked so far. :P”
“Now you’re just being deliberately annoying.” ~
It’s all going along okay until Hardison gets a very politely worded e-mail from ianto.jones@torchwood.com asking him to please stop hacking their e-mail because it’s upsetting his boss who is difficult enough on a good day. Hardison writes back the following: “You know, it’s not a secret organization if you have your name and the name of your organization actually in the e-mail.” A few days later Hardison gets the following e-mail from i.jones@supersecrethushhushorganization.com.

Dean Winchester meets Ianto Jones when he’s trying to kill Jack Harkness. A hunter had heard from another hunter about this smug bastard who just wouldn’t fucking die no matter what. And once Dean had made sure that they weren’t actually talking about him, he decided it might be something fun to kill. It’s not that he’s bored or anything, it’s just there really hasn’t been all that much to do since the apocalypse. Dean had never really thought post-apocalyptic career plans was something he was going to need to worry about. He should have known that the dick angels couldn’t throw a proper apocalypse.
~ “You’re not going to question the existence of angels?” Dean asks. Ianto shrugs. “I met some fairies once.”
~
Dean doesn’t really care and doesn’t pay much attention to the explanation. He just kills what he’s told to kill. It’s nice to finally be able to let other people worry about the big picture. He just shoots when he’s told shoot, ducks when he’s told to duck, and tries not to get covered with the bright pink alien slime. Aliens are apparently much messier than demons.
~ “Don’t think you’re distracting me. You need a fake id intervention for your own good. You used white-out on your C.I.A badge. White. Out. That’s disgraceful.”
~
“Wait… you’re creeped out by Picasso? You kill demons and vampire and zombies and other stuff that I’m sure I don’t want to know about and you’re creeped out by Picasso?” Dean shrugs. “Why does he draw people like that? It’s weird.”
~ “Dude,” Dean interrupts. “You’re completed wasted. Awesome.” Ianto goes on at length about his opinions on this statement. Again, he has absolutely no clue what he’s saying, but he’s sure it’s brilliant. “Man, you are a foul mouthed drunk. I wish I could tape this. Are you swearing in alien languages?” Dean asks.
~
Dean’s phone rings and before he can even say, “Who the fuck is calling me at three in the damn morning?” Hardison is babbling away. “I would have texted you, but I don’t think you even know what that is. And I won’t even start on the odds of you ever opening an e-mail. Do you even know what a computer is?” “Computers are where the porn lives,” Dean says.
~ “I’d be offended by that, but she said I have a nice ass, so I’m going to let it pass,” Dean says.
~
“Most people,” he says as he wipes the blood off his knife, “go to Disneyland when they go on vacation. Or a beach somewhere.”
“I’ve never killed a vampire before. Aren’t you supposed to try new things on holiday?”
~
She blinks at him. Alec tries not to stare at her lips. “Are you refusing sex?” “No” Alec says. Wait, that’s not what he meant to say. “I’m mean yes, I’m saying no. This is a bad idea. I mean, I like you and like sex. I really, really like sex and you’re hot, but oh fuck it, fine. I just want it noted that I expressed my concerns that this all going to end in disaster.” “Noted,” she nods and then kisses him again. She’s really good with the kissing.
~
“Dean killed Jack! A lot.”
“That doesn’t mean you can kill his angel,” Hardison says. “I can’t believe I’m having this discussion.” “It wouldn’t work, anyway,” Sam says. “You can stab him in the chest and he’ll just look at you all sad and reproachful.” “See?” Ianto says. “Exactly like killing Jack.”
~ “Why did you do that?” Castiel asks as he pulls the knife out of his chest. He doesn’t look angry, just baffled. “You need to stop upsetting Dean,” Ianto says. Castiel frowns and turns to Sam for help. Sam shrugs. “He’s Welsh. Apparently they’re all insane.”
~ “So you thought it would be a good idea to head butt a monster with a spiked head?” Ianto asks. “There weren’t any spikes when I made that decision,” Dean says.
~ “I think I’ve decided what I’m going to do with my life,” Ianto says. “I’m going to take over the world.” “Don’t do it on Thursday,” Hardison says. “I’ve got to fly to Boston on Thursday. Plane travel and world domination generally don’t mix.” “You’re not going to try and stop me?” Ianto asks. Dean shrugs. “Everyone needs a goal in life.” “If your dirty foot touches my computer one more time…” Hardison threatens. ‘What?” Dean asks. “Like this?” Hardison shoves Dean off the couch fifteen seconds earlier than Ianto had predicted. Dean yanks at Hardison’s ankle and they both end up rolling around on the floor. “I feel like you’re not taking this seriously,” Ianto says. Dean looks up from where he has Hardison pinned down to the floor. “When you take over the world, will I get free pie?” “Yes,” Ianto says. “Then I’m all for it. Have fun!” “What Dean is trying to say in all his emotionally stunted glory,” Hardison adds, “is that it’s not like the people running things now are doing all that great a job, so if taking over the world makes you happy, then we’re all for it, and we’re sure you’ll do a great job.” “That’s not what I meant at all,” Dean complains. “I just want free pie.”
~ “Fine. If everything goes according to plan, I should have over half the world under my control in six years.” “Are you starting with Australia?” Hardison asks. “That’s the best place to start in Risk.”
~ “I do my best cleaning with a semi-hangover, after I’ve reached the end of the internet.”
~ James’ middle name is Alexander. He doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with that, either. A perfectly standard name, Alexander is. It’s strong. Manly. Remus would probably say something swotty like stalwart, but James has often suspected that Remus is off his tree. The point is, it’s a good name— a great name, if history can be believed. It’s strong, manly, and possibly stalwart. At any rate, it’s a right sight better than Sirius’ middle names. Yes, names. Sirius has two, and they’re both terribly poncy.
~ When one of Sirius’ books suggested werewolves could tolerate the presence of animals, they all complained it was a shame they weren’t animals, until James remembered there was a spell for that.
~ “The last time I saw my mother was fifteen years ago.”
“No, Shawn, it wasn’t. It was three weeks ago.”
“Gus, who’s telling this story, me or you?”
“Who’s telling it incorrectly? You. I’m just editing on the fly.”
“So, I saw my mother fifteen years ago,” Shawn said. “Whether or not it was the last time is up for debate.”
“No, it’s not,” Gus said, settling another marshmallow on his stick and angling it into the fire. “That’s fact.”
“Gus. Do you want to tell this story?”
“Sure.”
Shawn stopped. “Wait, really?”
“If it means we get to hear the correct version, then yes.
Shawn pouted. Then shrugged. “Okay then,” Shawn said with a wave of his hand. “Go for it.”
Gus fidgeted a little in his seat, getting comfortable, then leaned forward. “The year,” he said in a low voice, “was 1994—”
“Oh come on! That is your intro?”
Gus sat up and glared. “You said I could tell this story, Shawn.”

“Why do you insist on turning my music down when you come in here?” he asked. “Because it allows me to maintain the illusion that you actually listen to me when I talk to you,” she answered.
~ “How’re you feeling?” Ryan says, with that look on his face where he’s not smiling but he looks secretly amused.  She means to say “Terrible,” but it comes out something more like, “Blurrrgh.”
~ “Hey, don’t laugh! You said you wouldn’t laugh.” “No, no, I said I wouldn’t tell anyone. There’s a difference.”
~ Kirk doesn’t get away fast enough, and McCoy jabs him in the neck with a hypospray. “In my medical opinion, you should really spend the night here in sickbay,” says McCoy, then adds, “Also, that was a sedative.” And everything goes black.
~
“Careful,” warns Kirk. “That might be a little emotion on your face, just there.” 
Spock’s lips tighten just a little, and he schools his face back to blankness.
~
“You have been in the field and shown tenacity, bravery, and valour…not to mention levels of insubordination that have hitherto been thought to be impossible.” Hitherto? thinks Kirk.
~ “I said nothing I believe to be untrue,” says Spock primly. He hesitates for a moment, then adds, “It was also brought to my attention that after marooning you on an ice planet and attempting to strangle you to death, failing to speak out for your defence would make me, in the popular vernacular, a douche.”
~ He would realize later, of course, that perhaps attempting this feat in the dead of night so no one could see him was theoretically a good idea, but in practice, it was really completely terrible because he lost his footing in the dark, and both he and ten or so good-sized winter plums hit the ground quite hard.
~ “Hey. It’s me. Look… I know things haven’t been… I just mean… well, keep yourself safe. And Merry Christmas. Or something. I don’t know. Whatever.” Sighing, he hung up after leaving the worst phone message in the history of the technology.
~
“Plus, nobody knew it was fajita day and that hurt a lot of feelings in the cafeteria.”
“That explains all those sad people in sombreros, which is traditionally the happiest hat in the world.”
~
“So this is guilt. Hmm. In the past I’ve always counteracted this with other emotions, like sugar or drunk.”
~
“I need to make a man run screaming from my life.”
“Well, I’m happy that you came to me for advice, but sad that this is my area of expertise.”
~
“I have to know if they’re bound with real leather because they have to go with the sofa. I’ll give you £200 for them.”
“Are they leather-bound pounds? Because I need leather-bound pounds to go with my wallet.”

“Like the slogan says, “The research is theoretical, but the fun is real.””
~
“Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?”
~
“Hey. We’re going to the movies.”
“No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway having a pointlessly awkward encounter.”
~
“If you break up, she’ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning, and you’ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one.”
~
“You didn’t know I was upset? Maybe you missed all the subtle indicators, like me saying, “Howard, I am upset.” Maybe that means something different in this country, but back home that means I’m upset with a guy named Howard.”
~
“Well, I guess that makes you a liar then, because I’m as drunk as hell and you’re still here.”
“Stop yelling, you’re making Sheldon cry.”
“I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry: that I let you name him Sheldon.”
~
“I never admit defeat. However, on an unrelated topic, I’m never leaving this bed again.”
~
“Well, I f I was in your place, I know what I’d do.”
“I can team up with Batman and market that!”
“Or that.”
~
“Bernard, do you know nothing of modern culture? Beckham, Harry Potter, Pokémon?”
“Pacman. It’s pronounced Pacman.”
~
“The piano can’t be that difficult. And I must be musical; I’ve got hundreds of CDs.”
~
“Play faster. Feathery strokes, feathery strokes.”
“You just told me to dampen it.”
“Damp feathers.”
~
“Don’t do that. Of course I want to know. The more you tell me I don’t want to know, I want to know.”
~
“If I told you that the walls of my flat were actually moving in, would you think I was strange.”
“No, I’d ask you to come round and look after my small children.”
~
“I’ve come to serenade you. I can’t play the guitar so I brought this accordion. I can’t play this either, but I thought it might be less obvious.”
~
‘Mr. Sulu, Mr. Chekov,’ he intones, and Chekov feels his spine try to straighten itself in a fit of biological self-preservation. ‘How long more before we clear the Farmonion Corridor and re-enter established Federation space?’ Sulu and Chekov glance, as one, at the centre console, which reads out in neat, bright lettering EIGHT DAYS TWELVE HOURS AND THIRTY SIX MINUTES. Sulu looks at Chekov. Chekov looks back at him, desperate and pleading. Sulu raises an eyebrow, which is the universal expression that says ‘I am the senior officer here so it’s YOUR responsibility to tell the Vulcan exactly what he already logically knows but does not want to hear.’ 
~
“Our Russian whiz kid arrives,” the Captain looks up, a really wide smile on his face. Chekov feels a sudden moment of doubt— he has very good self-preservation instincts most of the time, and they are telling him that that is the same smile that the Captain had just before he blew up the Romulan ship and almost had them all sucked into a black hole.
~
Mr. Spock’s eyes flick towards the blatantly huge and complicated (and exciting) and blatantly huge mathematical and engineering schematics on the console screen. Chekov can practically see the cogs in Mr. Spock’s mind whirr - he is very, very fast at telemetry, which means there is probably no getting around the fact that what they have here is a plan to break the current warp speed record into many small pieces. Pavel wonders if that is the only thing that will be broken. Mr. Spock’s eyes narrow. “Captain,” he says. “I would inquire if this is an example of yet another human prank on your part, but over time I have come to suspect that you take the whole of life to be a practical joke, so I will skip my usual questions and instead say just one thing.” Kirk’s mouth is twitching; Chekov wonders if it is because his cells know fear even if his mind doesn’t. “And what is that, Mr. Spock?” Mr. Spock tilts his head. “No.”
~
“What do you want, anyway? Because if it’s another goddamn rash, you’re just gonna have to man up and go to the clinic. There’re only so many antibiotics I can steal before they start asking questions.” Jim frowns, because really there was only that one time. And, okay, that other time, too, maybe, but that technically wasn’t so much a rash as a pox. And that thing with the half-Andorian totally didn’t count, either, because that one went away on its own after a few horrible, burny hours.
~ Bones sniffs suspiciously at the food. It’s his favourite, and he’s mollified enough to indulge Jim at least a little. So he bites: “Delta Delta Vega? Isn’t that the ice cube Admiral Komack keeps threatening to post you on if you don’t straighten up and fly right?” “No, that’s just Delta Vega. I added the extra ‘delta’ to make it sound more official. I’ve been reading up on student clubs, and apparently that’s how people used to name these things—just stringing together random Greek letters and acting like it meant something.” Bones starts to point out that he doesn’t think vega is technically a Greek letter, but really, that ranks pretty low on the list of Things Wrong With This Picture. Instead he says, “Those idiots actually let you start a club?”
~ “Your shirt is pink,” Bones says, because dear sweet God in heaven, it IS pink.
~
“He got me these sweetass sandals.” Bones isn’t entirely sure what “sweetass” means, but he’s pretty sure those sandals don’t qualify.
~
“So Beckett’s either calling because there’s a dead body…or she read the article about the two of us. I’m praying for murder.”
“That just might happen anyway.”
~
“Sure, you’ll be fine,” she said, sarcastically. “That’s what you said when you tried to deep-fry that turkey. I just don’t want you to get hurt...or burn your eyebrows off again.”
~
“It depends. If a guy bites his cuticles and then swallows them does that make him a cannibal? Because then I had an exciting date with a cannibal rather than one with a guy with a disgusting habit.”
~
“These leather pants make my legs feel so cool. I can’t believe my lower half is letting my upper half hang out with it.”
~ “It’s not a vendetta,” Wolf protested, overlapping Snake, “It’s an inventory of his abilities.”
“Vendetta.” Fox and Eagle said together, glancing at each other once they did so.
~
“You believe in the afterlife?” “Well, I don’t exactly believe in life— in my currently being alive, I mean— so I’m kinda backed into a corner here.”
~ “My essence provides all the nourishment this body needs.” “Yeah, but you’re here. You should take some time to stop and smell the onion rings.”
~
“Yeah, he’s no longer someone we can contact for help. We kind of had a falling out.”
“Can’t you apologise?”
“If I had a time machine…or a hell of an ouija board.”
~
“She’s not just a girl. She’s the only evidence of God I can find on this wasted planet. Well, her, and the mystical force that always removes one of my socks from the dryer.”
~
“People were reluctant to buy land out there because of the smell of cow.”
~
“Throughout ‘The King and I’ all I wanted was for Anna and the King to get together. But I kept thinking, ‘He has fifty-six wives and she has all those hoop skirts.’”

“Don’t be silly. Dinosaurs are a myth created by the CIA to discourage time travel.”
~
“I never said I hated school and the old gang.”
“You didn’t have to. I just looked at your life now and worked backwards.”
~
“Oh, look, you’ve got a message.”
“No! Don’t touch that button. The light only means the answering machine needs more salt.”
~
“Manny? It’s Mum. We should be arriving sometime between 5:45 pm and 5:47 pm.”
~
“I’m sorry,” Luke interrupts, grinning, “Did you just say our cause?”
Han looks thoughtful for a moment. Then he says, “No. Pass the whiskey.” They sit through the next morning’s command briefing with horrific hangovers, and Leia smirks evilly every time one of them winces at a loud noise.
~
“Slow down, Fargo. Where’s the fire?” Jack asked.
“You already know about the fire?”
~
“You’re dead,” Will repeats patiently. Sometimes this takes a while to get across. “You’re not my prisoner.”
~
For some reason, Tony’s voice seemed to ghost past her inner ear. Lie, Potts, it advised her cheerfully, and she gave up compunction and obeyed. “Yes.”
~
“Her vocal technique consisted of a shot of Jack Daniels and a pack a day.”
~
The robot, which was named Daniel Lambert (that’s...that’s actually the weirdest part) was dressed like a human so as to “not scare the horses.” Because horses will be totally OK with a nearly 8 foot tall iron giant running 5200-feet a minute while pulling a carriage, just as long as it’s dressed like a proper gentleman.

“What the hell, Parker?” Eliot yells, pulling her back from the pile of zombie bones quickly becoming ash. Parker shrugs, her head tilting to one side, the flames reflecting in her eyes.  “Hardison made me watch all three Resident Evils.  A lot.” Her face twists then, a sort of confusion there that is painful to see and Eliot wonders if she’s worried about Hardison in light of the sudden appearance of zombies and maybe her mind just doesn’t know how to properly process that sort of actual human emotion. But then her face smooths out and she swings the axe up on her shoulder, looking eager.  “Are there more?”
~ The only good thing about the things Eliot still refuses to call zombies, because, come on, is that they are slow as hell, one foot dragging behind, mouths hanging open with a continual moan of sound spilling out.  Creepy as all hell, but slow, mostly.  It’s the way they just appear without warning, popping out of freaking thin air in large packs and how the hell is that fair? He found a second fire axe during their scramble out of the studio.  He adjusts his grip to lumberjack and tries not to resent that this wasn’t part of basic training.  If this shit is actually possible, you think someone might have mentioned it at some point.
~ Parker, meanwhile, seems unconcerned with the stench, instead marching straight up to Hardison, wrapping her arms around him in a way that manages in no way to resemble a hug, her forehead thumping solidly against his sternum.  “I’m glad the zombies didn’t eat your brain,” she says. Hardison doesn’t seem to mind that she’s pinned his arms to his sides, just smiles down at her, resting his chin on her head. Eliot isn’t sure what’s more disturbing, this awkward display of geek love, or the fact that it’s the one thing he’s seen today that actually makes sense.
~ “Main theory seems to be a zombie lord in New York City,” Hardison remarks.  “A zombie lo—,” Eliot starts to ask before he thinks better of it.  “Never mind.  I don’t want to know.  We just stay as far away from New York as possible.  Got it.” Hardison grins in that ‘scary mad-genius running around a lab’ way that he’s got.  He flips open a thick black book that Eliot swears says something about dungeons and a dragon on the front.  “The zombie lord is the mastermind, the only one who can call off his minions,” Hardison informs them.
~
“Just to be clear, going to New York is completely insane.” “Yup,” Hardison agrees, sounding bizarrely cheerful and not even remotely discouraged.  “I’m just saying, for the record, insane,” Eliot emphasizes again, but Hardison’s head is lowered back to his iPhone as he asks the thing for directions to New York City with the least proximity to cemeteries and hospitals, because, well, zombies.
~
“I feel like I’ve heard this before,” Tony says thoughtfully. “Are you still mad at me about that time in Puerto Vallarta?” Rhodes narrows his eyes. “I thought we agreed that we wouldn’t talk about that again.” “No, you said we wouldn’t talk about it again; I was drunk.” Rhodey scowls. “Clearly not drunk enough.” “I was drunk enough to know that that thing you do with your mouth is illegal in a lot of states,” Tony says beatifically. “I could just break your leg at the knee and then you wouldn’t have to worry about getting this boot off,” Rhodey replies just as breezily. Tony nods his head. “Now there’s a thought” “You want to keep having them?”
~
Except Pepper doesn’t answer her mobile. Or her home phone. Or the emergency phone that Tony had stashed in her Audi for those occasions when she claimed to have lost her cell phone and her PDA and her GPS mysteriously cuts out.
~ It’s dirty in that way that the cover of the Little Mermaid video cover was dirty, if you know what I mean. And if you don’t know what I mean, don’t Google it at work.

Ned could believe it, despite the rather fantastic nature of the scene before him. Simply because Ned had never pondered what Emerson’s bedroom would look like, and therefore there was no preconceived notion in his mind to replace.
~ “But what if it means finding him, and saving his life! I don’t think he’ll mind then.” “Oh, I’m pretty sure he’ll still mind,” The Pie Maker muttered. “And if he was kidnapped, and we don’t even know that for sure, what kind of kidnapper would leave a clue in the bedside table?”
~ “He said, ‘Where is Ned?’ So I, of course, said, ‘He went to get his hair cut because Olive really messed up the back the last time.’ And then he didn’t say anything... he laughed. Because your hair was seriously very funny in the back after that, it looked sort of like a lightning bolt turned on its…” “And after he was done mocking me…” “Right. I said that you weren’t around, and I asked him if I could help him instead. He said no, and I persisted, and he said no a few more times until he finally said yes, and he said that he was going to meet with the Twinn brothers and if he wasn’t back by midnight, he had been kidnapped.”
~
“That is my afghan. You do not mess with another man’s afghan. That is just not right.”
~ “We were looking for clues. To see if someone had taken you from your home, or if you had any threatening messages on your answering machine...” “You listened to the messages on my answering machine?” 
Chuck paused. “Nope,” Chuck lied.
“No,” Ned added.
~
“Martha, why is that guy answering your door in his boxer shorts?” Tom asked, his tone light but his meaning clear.
~
“Darts,” Sam decided, and pushed himself to his feet. They must’ve fallen asleep because they nearly dumped him to the floor, but Dean hooked a hand under his arm and kept him upright. His brother was always doing stuff like that. Sam didn’t know who would once Dean was gone, but he wasn’t thinking like that, not today. “We should play darts,” he announced instead, breathing heavily into Dean’s face.
Dean’s nose wrinkled. “Give you something sharp to throw? Yeah, I don’t think so.” His grip tightened on Sam, the other hand pressing against Sam’s back. “C’mon, Sasquatch, time for bed.”
~ “I’m not watching, I’m channel surfing, see?” He flicked through a few stations to prove his point. Fox News, NCIS re-run, Sesame Street, Dallas re-run, Law and Order re-run, Teletubbies…
~ “I have neither a television screen in my belly, or an antenna on my head.” said Castiel “As such, I was unable to conduct the electricity, or show them the short film they wanted to see.” Dean pursed his lips. “You got beaten up. By Teletubbies.”
~ “Do you have the strength of ten men by any chance?” Stark asked Peter.  “Um…kinda.” More like a hundred, but it wasn’t like that was really measurable, and, well, he sounded like a geek if he said it out loud.
~
“Yeah, Spidey! Get him!”  “Hey, it’s Iron Man too!” Stark yelled back.  “You’re the one being rescued, you don’t get cheerleaders,” Peter said.

I can only assume that LiveJournal has not seen this, as LiveJournal has not yet exploded in joy.

Sometimes I’m mystified by the fact that fish-women in comics still have mammal secondary sex characteristics, and then I think about how super-nerdy it is to be critiquing the dubious biology of gender-swapped calendar super-hero calendar girls.
~ I mean, this is a general pouch complaint. You cannot put f***ing anything in pouches that small. Carry a f***ing backpack, okay? See, this is something women can relate to. You carry tiny little purses and have tiny little pockets in jeans and you can put exactly nothing in them. I appreciate that they’re trying to channel that real life experience into similarly impractical super-hero costume design.

On the other hand, his supervisor was allergic to incomplete reports. Nebulous sensations of misgivings from probationary officers bore no resemblance to cold, hard facts. And Mr. Scunthrope was as married to cold, hard facts as he was to Mrs. Scunthrope. More, if Mr. Scunthrope’s marital mutterings were anything to go by,

“I’d hardly call the lecture I got about the Cybermen ‘loving’.” “Entirely different situation,” said Liz, dismissing it with a wave of her hand. “Judging a new alien menace wholly on outward physical appearance and then going after them with some jewellery you nicked from—” “It was gold! They’ve always been vulnerable to gold!” “Always?”
“Well, once. I only met them once.” She shot a satisfied look at Jim, who was nodding and trying her very best to look exceedingly neutral.
~ “Kitchen,” said Sarah, “and, no, she won’t want help. Someone decided we should all help out one year and then someone managed to create a little fire that had the whole south wing ablaze.” “The electrics were faulty,” said Liz. “This is a very old house, and that wiring hadn’t seen the right side of 1950. Lucky it went up when it did— could have burnt the whole house down if no-one had been around.” “Anyway,” said Sarah, “since that rather unfortunate incident, Doris has banned everyone from the kitchen, apart from Alistair.”  “And I’m only allowed in if we run out of glasses.”
~
“None of them are allowed in here,” said Doris. “But until you have a hand in burning down part of my home, you may consider yourself welcome in here. But don’t tell any of them that or they’ll start arguing about whose fault it was last time.” “I thought Professor Shaw…” “Liz may have started it, but at least she had the sense to call the fire brigade instead of making the dashed thing ten times worse. But let’s not worry about all that now. I’m sure this year will go off without a hitch,” she said, sounding anything but optimistic.

~ “You have a meeting with Captain America. I’m not cancelling for you. I’ve just about had it with him. Every time I talk to him, he tries to take away my PDA because it’s too complicated for my little female brain.”  Peter snorted. Pepper frowned at him. “Maybe you could step on his foot with your spiky female shoes,” Peter suggested.  Pepper rolled her eyes. “I’m not going to cripple a man just because his brain hasn’t caught up to 2009. But I’m not letting Tony skip the meeting, either. Tony, go take a shower, you stink. And wear the blue suit. And the charcoal tie with the cubes. And comb your hair so he doesn’t call you a beatnik.”
~
It certainly wasn’t the first time she’d caught Tony with a man in his bed. Not even the first time that man was wearing a mask—but she firmly suppressed that memory, down, back down, into the locked cavern of Things She Did Not Want to Dwell on Ever.

“What’s missing from these pictures?”
“Good taste? An area rug? Professional lighting?”

Witness, for instance, the made-for-Hasbro SCUBA suit that Batman wore so that he could fight Orca the Whale Woman in 2000, which gave him the ability to both function underwater and match his opponent’s ability to shout his name in bold-face red type. I can only assume that’s one of the many powers granted by the underwater bat-wing pods on his gauntlets.
~ “It’s smut,” she said, with unappealing delight. “You have a box of smut! You have a box of smut.” “To describe these works as ‘smut’ is to inaccurately and unfairly denigrate a valid literary genre,” he said, “one which explores at exacting if excessively emotional detail the intricacies of human courtship in a fashion easily digested by—” “‘Hernando lathed her nipples with his tongue, dragging a low moan from her throat with each slow stroke of his tongue,’” Nyota read, pinning The Pirate King’s Virgin Bride open with her thumb. “‘Mary threw her head back, gasping, begging, pleading for more.’” “Your sampling is biased,” Spock said stiffly. “If you were to begin the book at the appropriate place, I believe you would find it an evocative and occasionally understated examination of the traditional roles of women and men in nineteenth century European society.”  Nyota did not immediately reply: as she read, her eyes widened; the curve of her mouth slackened. “Wait, did you—” She snapped her head up and stared at him. “That thing you did! You stole that! From this book!” She shook the book at him. “It appeared effective within the text,” he explained patiently. “To pursue a real world application of the technique seemed a logical decision.” “You plagiarist,” she said.

“How’s your memory?”
“Fantastic. I was shot by a smudge.”

I am not letting him swim off by himself to be taken for a baby seal by a great white and I will be fucked if I am going in there with him to be taken for an old skinny seal by a great white. When I explained to him that scuba gear is only for the sea and he, being such a small human, would be taken for a baby seal by a great white, he stated that he would see them coming because of the mask and added ‘speargun’ and ‘knife’ to his birthday list.
~ Simon’s Guide to Shopping at IKEA: Step 1: Ring David at 7.40am and ask him if he will come to IKEA with you. It is important to ring this early as David will be disorientated and agree to anything. 
Step 2: Ring David again at 8.05am to check that he got up as getting to IKEA early is imperative. This twenty five minute interval will ensure that if David did get up, he will be in the shower when you call. Ring David again at 9.15 to enquire where he is and ask him to get you a large latte on the way. If he declines, tell him not to be a selfish prick and remind him of the time you fed his fish while he was away six years ago.

~ “First of all, the Death Star is Star Wars. Red shirts are Star Trek. And the Source…what is that? Transformers?” he demanded indignantly.
Ollie frowned in confusion. “No, it’s the…the thing that the Jedi use. You know, to move stuff with their minds.”
“Well, he’s definitely not Skywalker. Luke and Leia were brother and sister. Clark doesn’t treat Lois like a sister. In fact he—”
“Is still standing. Right. Here. And you guys have both forgotten the actual point. Which, let me remind you, is that I can kill you both. With my eyes. And you’re not seeing my girlfriend naked,” he added pointedly.
~ “Luke,” intoned the Doctor, “I am your father.” He did not get the reaction for which he’d hoped.  “No, you’re not,” said Luke. “I was grown by the Bane in a lab. I haven’t got a father.” The Doctor put his hand on Luke’s shoulder, looked at him very seriously. “Search your feelings,” he said. “You know it to be true.” “No, it’s not,” Luke insisted, distinctly unfazed. “You just want to quote Star Wars at me.”
“And what’s wrong with Star Wars?” he asked, feeling slightly insulted on behalf of the local culture.  “Well, for one, there are all those noises in space. Space is a vacuum, or near enough. The sound wouldn’t travel like that. And also, the whole idea of a single planetary-wide climate doesn’t make any sense. Even on a small planet, there would have to be changes in—” “Right, right, yes, but besides the science. They’re human, after all, you can’t expect them to get the science right every time. Artistic license. You have to focus on the story.” “Right,” said Luke. “So in The Empire Strikes Back, how come Luke Skywalker can spend all that time training on Dagobah while Han and Leia spend maybe a day or two trying to get away from Darth Vader, and—”
~ “But…you’re not a father figure. You’re hardly ever even here. And I’m pretty sure Mum wouldn’t like it if I emulated you, she says I shouldn’t blow things up if I can help it.” “I don’t blow things up if I can help it!” the Doctor insisted, voice rising. “It’s not like I do it for fun! Someone’s got to save the world! You can’t make an omelette without blowing up some eggs!” “I don’t think that’s how that saying goes,” Luke pointed out helpfully. “And Mum saves the world all the time without blowing things up. We hardly ever blow up anything. You blow things up every time you’re here.”
~
“Don’t worry about how you look, sweetheart. My mom will never like you and my dad’s just glad you’re not a guy.”
~
“If you have sex with a woman with two first names –Mary Jane, Ann Marie—does it count a threesome?”
~
Despite Don repeatedly telling his brother that Flubber was fictional and from a kid’s movie, Charlie ignored him and invented it anyway.
 ~ Dean grinned. “Can you get me one of those hot nurses?”  John sighed. “Oh, yeah. You’re gonna be fine.” He turned from them, heading for the door. “Is that a no?” Dean’s voice asked as John walked out, shutting the door behind him.
~ “Oh God, please, just kill me. Seriously, take that fork and push it into my eyeball until you feel brain...” is what you want to say, but instead you just blink at him.
~ “You must have been tired. Fell asleep mid-sentence.” “Yeah,” Sam scrubs his eyes drowsily, “what was I saying?”  “Something about how awesome I am. You know, the usual.”
~ “It’s my best guess. We’ve got a dead Irish man and an Irish fairy that likes to kill Irish men. Pretty cut and dried if you ask me. The sooner we can put this thing down, the better.”
~ They reach the farm driveway and reduce speed to an achingly slow pace. “Goddamn loudass gravel,” Dean mumbles under his breath and Sam can’t help but laugh.
~ “Be careful,” Sam cautions. 
“Your vision didn’t show him falling from up here and breaking his neck, did it?” “No, but…” “Yeah, so stop being such a colossal baby.”
~ She nods at the lush farmland around him. “I can make things grow bigger, sweeter, and live longer. I can even resurrect things from the dead.” Dean gives her a shocked look. “Things. Not people. We learned that lesson when my mother died.” Eileen shivers a little.
~
“Dammit. Sammy, don’t hurt the Pooka.” He grimaces, then grinds out, “the Pooka is on our side. He’s…friendly. Don’t hurt him.” He hangs up and looks at Eileen. “Pooka is a stupid sounding word.” Eileen grins. “Don’t ever let him hear you say that.”
~ “Nothing good ever happens when we split up.” “We can cover more ground, and hey, if this thing does come after one of us at least we won’t have to search anymore.”
~ “I built you a robot.” “Traditionally, that’s not proof of chivalrous romantic intent.” ~
“Gentlemen should not—”
“Oh, they should,” Hurst said quickly. “And certainly in the company of other gentlemen. If you do not help us out, we shall be forced to jump to conclusions, is that no so, Bingley?”
~
“I’m not sulking. I’m registering that I disagree with you. I’m also contemplating brooding.”
~
“Oh, come on, Lizzy. You’re a gorgeous, intelligent, witty, talented woman!” Lizzy sighed.
“Maybe I should have that tattooed across my forehead.”
“Put your phone number up there, too. It’ll save time,” Jane giggled.
~ She rams the last connections into place and slams the engine cover shut. “Oh, for goodness sake! You’re immortal – couldn’t you come up with a less idiotic neurosis than a death wish?” He looks genuinely stricken, and she feels guilty at once. “Sorry. I’m sorry. Look, how about we go somewhere where you can get that fixed? There are pills you can take for that kind of thing.”
~ “He’s pretty,” Jenny says appreciatively. “Only on the outside,” the Captain mutters, glowering at the empty space where the hologram had been.
~ It was the wings that gave away the game. It was also the wings that sent Dean into fits of hysterical laughter. John Winchester: Guardian Angel stood quietly, arms folded and waited for his son to get his shit together long enough to have a serious conversation.
~ “Right, back to the subject of our impending doom…” said Ron, “what’s the plan?” The group looked unsure at one another. Harry shrugged. “Oh good,” replied the Weasley boy, and rubbed his forehead in desperation.
~ “They were people who had the courage to fight for what they believed in, so kapow!” He made a gesture of obliteration with his hands.
~
“Dude would not shut up,” Captain Winchester remarked. “He was all ‘you shall pay for this insolence’ and ‘your weapons cannot harm me’ when he wasn’t slamming us against the walls.”
“Beheading?” Jack inquired, okay, maybe a little impatiently.
“Shooting him didn’t work,” said Dr Winchester casually, “He had some sort of force shield or something.”
“Didn’t work very well against the machete,” he added his brother thoughtfully.
“We shot the snake thing, though.”
~ “You crash that and you’ll have a very angry pregnant woman coming after you. It took her months of late nights to pull that thing off.”
Cassie raised an eyebrow in a very Teal’c-like fashion as she felt the keys in her hand, “Time was she could do it in half that.”
Jack shrugged unapologetically, “I made her stop to sleep and eat regularly. And take walks out in the sun.”
~
“I also like how Fury is like, “Wolverine, Jean, we need you guys to go in and scope things out.” And then just in case the crack team didn’t know what he meant: “Your job is RECONNAISSANCE.” He reads like a video game mission. Like Metal Gear Solid on the NES. Or just Metal Gear. Nick Fury is totally their DM. “Okay, you guys are in a tavern when a curious man approaches you...”“
~
“Okay, here’s where this issue goes off the rails: Jean loses her telepathy on the island and NOBODY CARES. Isn’t her telepathy THE ENTIRE REASON JEAN WAS SENT TO THE ISLAND? Remember that? FROM TWO PAGES AGO? And yeah, I had to flip back and forth a few times wondering if I missed a page. The absolutely nonchalant way she announces that she’s 100% powerless on this island is amazing. Don’t telepaths usually completely lose their sh-t when their telepathy disappears? Because Jean’s response is to put flowers in her hair and go swimming.”
~
“Also, did I miss something, or is it ever actually revealed why Jean’s telepathy was completely blocked? Was that part of the Science Magic Soul-Mind Subversion machine? I’m starting to think Jean’s telepathy was blocked because the issue was finished and then an assistant editor asked “why doesn’t Jean just use her telepathy to call for help?”“
~
“This is an issue where Wolverine and Jean Grey fight the Hand, and Wolverine fights a grand total of zero ninjas. Takeda does do a really great job with the crashing surf and all the ninjas and Jean looking all foxy, but seriously? What the hell comic is this where Wolverine can’t fight off a hundred ninjas? That’s all that dude did in the ‘80s. In any other comic, the next page would’ve been him cleaning dissolving green chunks off his claws going “We have to find out who sent these ninjas after us!”“
“I’ve found the line of the book. The ultimate personification of Mont’n it up: “When my blades cut you, you’ll bleed -- and then you’ll scream!” Not only is he teaching us, the readers, how blades work, but also describing the panel through dialogue.”
~ Also, Wolverine’s line “you read minds, I read bodies” -- that’s like half a step below “Are those space pants?”
~
“It’s not just me though, right? Nothing makes sense in this issue? It’s pretty much a series of discrete events strung together by very thin narrative tape. His writing reminds me of the way I played with action figures as a kid. Like, stuff just happens.”
“You had action figures flirt on the beach for ten pages while making cryptosexist comments?”
~ “Back up,” he compromised. “Five feet between you and the shiny things at all times, and keep your hands in your pockets. And, I don’t know. Diamonds have never been Ellie’s thing.” Neal shook his head sadly. “Peter, she’s just telling you that because she loves you - diamonds are every woman’s thing.” “I think I know my wife a little better than you do,” he said confidently. Mostly confidently. “She doesn’t need flashy things, she’s elegant.” “Fine, fine. But, please, at least rethink the waffle iron.” “El said she wanted a new one. She wants it, I get it for her, everyone’s happy.” “I can see it now, looking back in your twilight years and she’s overcome with emotion as she remembers her WafflePro.”  “I hate to say it,” Hughes said from the doorway, “but he’s right. Do not buy your wife any kind of kitchen appliance.” Neal looked sympathetic. “And there’s the voice of experience. What was it?” “Blender,” Hughes replied gruffly and walked across the room to join them.
~ He drew back carefully and then stood before he glanced at Neal, who was straightening his cuffs. His cuffs. Presumably, Peter guessed, because it was important to look your best in these situations. God forbid the shooting start before Neal’s tie had been smoothed as well. Neal glanced over and then widened his eyes just enough to suggest a what? As if he didn’t know. Peter gave him an admonishing look. “You know, a lot of people don’t get caught in the middle of a robbery on Valentine’s Day,” Neal whispered, apparently unfazed. “And this is, what? Twice for you now, three times?” “Twice,” Hughes murmured in a flat tone, which nonetheless managed to suggest that they might want to stop screwing around and, perhaps, stop a robbery in progress. Just a thought? Even Neal looked impressed at the depth of meaning Hughes had managed in a single whispered word. “There was one man at the safe, one at the door, one on the floor, and I think there may be another one somewhere else. There were four bags,” Peter said.  He didn’t like somewhere else, but criminals rarely considered his feelings. “What do you think?” He asked the exception to the rule Neal peered cautiously around the door and then ducked back. 
“Three out of ten, with an extra point for the stockings. That’s just adorable.” “Please don’t rate the armed robbers,” Hughes growled as he came closer.  “Especially on their vintage chic,” Peter agreed, and then moved to the side to let Hughes take his own look.
~
“They’re still amateurs and amateurs panic. Personally, I don’t like it when people carrying shotguns panic. That’s just me.”
~
Whenever possible both men preferred Peter be the intermediary for anything more than the most casual conversation. That way Neal could pretend he wasn’t really working for the FBI and Hughes could pretty much pretend Neal wasn’t working for the FBI too.
~
“I have an idea,” Peter said slowly and glanced down at his cell. “We need to get them—” Neal’s eyes widened with understanding. “Sure, that’s easy. You want me to—” Peter nodded rapidly and waved him off. “Yeah, go do that. Buy Jones five, maybe.” Neal nodded and ducked around the corner.  “You want to fill in some nouns?” Hughes asked mildly.
~
She didn’t look away; it was probably just as well, he was getting too old to throw himself out of windows while people were distracted.
~
Door Man edged closer and then, when he was sure Neal wasn’t going to magically turn into a twelve-man SWAT invasion, put his shotgun on the floor and began a pat down.
~
“Neal is trying to talk him out of getting you a waffle iron.” She blinked. “But I want a waffle iron.”
~
“Put what back?” Neal asked, innocently. Peter hadn’t been absolutely sure - not a hundred percent, anyway - but Neal’s expression of wide-eyed innocence was as good as DNA evidence and a roomful of nuns as sworn witnesses.
~
“The list of things I wouldn’t do for you is approximately two items long and the first one is: help you get yourself killed!”
~ “We need to have another chat?” Dean asks pleasantly, ignoring Sam’s frantic attempts to telegraph don’t provoke him, you moron without opening his mouth.
~
“Did you seriously get into a fight defending my virtue?” Sam asks incredulously. Dean looks uncomfortable. “Not exactly.”
~
When he looks up again, his expression is caught halfway between guilty and hopeful. “I guess it wouldn’t make a difference if I told you that you really don’t want to know.” “I really do want to know.” “No, you really, really don’t,” Dean mutters, and damn it, now Sam’s even more curious. He tries for honest. “Come on, man, you know I’m gonna bug you until you tell me, so you might as well get it over with.” Dean throws up his hands. “Fine! Fine, but if you’re traumatized for life I’m not paying your therapy bills.” “No, some credit card company in Oregon will end up paying my therapy bills,” Sam says. “You’re stalling.” “I told them you were mine, okay?” Dean says in such a rush that Sam can barely decipher the words. “You told a bunch of inmates that I was your bitch.” Sam thinks that his voice sounds kind of freakishly calm, considering the hysteria that’s beginning to build like a slow bubble in the back of his throat. “And you just—” Sam stops again, mercifully stonewalled by his own brain. “Gross.” “Hey, you should be so lucky.”
~
“And you know you can, uh, tell me anything, right? If you want to?” As meaningful statements go, it leaves a lot to be desired. Dean blinks and shifts his posture, brow furrowed, baffled expression firmly in place. “Yeah,” he says. “I know. Are we done with the heart-to-heart now?”
~
“Most people find me charming,” House huffed, feigning hurt. “Most people find your personality `grating and repulsive’,” Wilson told him. “And before you ask, yes, that is a direct quote.”
~
“Oh, will you look at that?” House said, taking back his phone. “I think she hung up on you.” Angel groaned. “Laugh it up. If she sends Andrew, I won’t be the only one suffering.” “That bad?” House asked skeptically. “He speaks six languages. Four of them were created for fictional worlds I haven’t even heard of.”
~
“According to this, these guys can ask me pretty much anything they want,” House told him. “They also have Power of Attorney, all the rights of next of kin, and, assuming I’m reading this correctly, the right to lock you in a small, reinforced cell if someone named `Rupert Giles’ deems it necessary. Man, these guys own your ass.”
~ “You wouldn’t have to keep him. I’m pretty sure he has all his organs, you could probably make a killing on the black market.” “Didn’t you promise Giles you wouldn’t try to sell Andrew’s kidneys after the incident in Mombasa?” Faith asked. “I’m not. I’m asking him to do it,” Xander pointed out. “Besides, he doesn’t have to sell the kidneys. He could keep those for himself. Make a nice conversation piece for his office, put them in a nice jar by his computer or something.” Xander shrugged. “He’s alright. I just get a little tired of him—” “Pining after you relentlessly? Mooning after your fine ass night and day? Doodling `Mr. Andrew Harris’ on the back of all his notebooks?” Faith suggested. “Two words, Faith: singing telegram. He sent me a singing telegram on Valentine’s Day. I think I’m entitled to a little illegal organs trade,” Xander said, crossing his arms over his chest. “Don’t even think about it,” Wilson ordered House, who did his best to look innocent. “I would never do something to embarrass you like that,” House protested. “And I certainly wouldn’t do it without some sort of special occasion to mark the event- say, your birthday, which is a mere month and a half away...” “No. Absolutely not.” Wilson’s face was set determinedly, the angle of his jaw suggesting the finality of the statement. “Don’t be such a baby. Besides, I’d much rather see the look on Cuddy’s face— hey, do they make stripping telegrams? Because I’m willing to bet that she doesn’t see nearly enough cowboys in ass-less chaps,” House ruminated.
~
“Hey, you know what they say about assumptions, doc,” Xander protested. “Asses and... um... mumptions or something.”
~ “—yeah, like, a million trillion quadrillion to one, I know, Spock.” Spock’s eyebrows look affronted. “That is not a real number, Captain.”
~
At least he didn’t get stabbed, he thinks, although his head is hurting enough that he think he might’ve been stupid enough to get into another bar fight. He has a moment to think that everything is back to normal, that he’d just dreamed the whole thing, when he realizes that this Sickbay is much smaller than the one he’s used to, and he groans as he realizes he’s still in the other universe. “I hate alternative universes,” he grouses, although he can’t be heard over McCoy raking Spock over the coals for knocking out his captain and friend. “You never find the good one where you’re supreme ruler and all the women want to have sex with you all the time.”
~ “If you wouldn’t go running off to the next planet to get stabbed—” “—it was a diplomatic mission to an assassin planet and I didn’t even want to go—” “—shot—” “—that phaser barely grazed me, and I really only need one kidney, you said—” “—clapped in irons—” “—that happened one time! One time, and it wasn’t even my fault that the translator wasn’t set up to tell the difference between ‘pet’ and ‘food’ in that language—” “—I wouldn’t need to inject all sorts of things into you to keep you alive,” McCoy finishes with a growl and a look in his eye that says Kirk will get another hypo if he doesn’t shut up. “You’re a menace with a Starfleet uniform.”
~ Hardison raised an eyebrow at him. “Well, you know who she is, apparently.” Eliot stopped, shifting uncomfortably. “I have nieces.” “You have a convenient excuse, is what you have.”
~ Alec couldn’t help himself. “You’re so adorable when you get mad. You’re like a little teddy bear who knows kung fu.”
~ “It’s not like he can talk when his mouth is full of tongue,” Parker observed. “Okay, TMI,” Alec said. Parker snorted. “Please. You should see where his hands are.” “La la la,” Alec said. “Not listening.”
~ “Because he is canonically a heterosexual, that’s why,” Alec said. “He loves women. Many women. Many beautiful, badass women.”
“Yeah, and he also spends a lot of time in skintight clothing, wrestling buff guys.” “You are ruining my childhood right this very minute. Right now. As you speak.” Eliot grinned as if it was the best thing he’d heard all day.
~
“Seriously?” Eliot asked. The truck was refrigerated, and Eliot was wearing a giant puffy coat and fuzzy earmuffs. “It’s difficult to take your menacing expression seriously when your coat has a fur collar,” Alec said.
~
“I know where you sleep,” she says darkly.
“Jarvis would protect me,” he replies blithely.
~ Dean gaped at him. “Son of a—”
“Hey, that’s your mom, too,” Sam admonished mildly, still grinning, completely unrepentant.
~
“Don’t play with semantics on me, Lane. I actually graduated high school on time.” “You hit low, Smallville.” “You’re short, Lane.”
~
She wipes at the cherry red smear, smearing it, and gives an exasperated sigh. “You’re not in love with me Barney.” “Not true.” “Well I’m not in love with you.” “Of course you’re not. Where’s the fun in that? Where the challenge? This is why there’s going to be wooing. Game *on*, Scherbatsky.”
~ Ron was currently choking so hard that pumpkin juice trickled out of his nose.
“You could have at least waited to break the news to him when his mouth was empty,” Hermione said reproachfully.
“I didn’t know he would react like that,” Harry lied. He’d felt in need of cheering up, and it was impossible to remain serious when Ron was turning a bright magenta that clashed horribly with his hair and dribbling pumpkin juice out of his nostrils.
~
“…she didn’t fill out the paperwork. She wasn’t supposed to go yet.” Harry looked down at the substantial stack of parchment on his desk, rather at a loss.
“Ha, you run and tell her that, why don’t you.” He pulled the door open slightly and peeked around, swearing inventively and closing it as quietly as possible. “I’m delegating her paperwork to you.” There was a long pause, and Harry’s eyes fell on the identical stack beside it. “But I’ll do it if you deal with Parkinson.”
“No deal,” Ron said quickly, making to snatch the stack of parchment from Harry’s desk. “I accept that delegation.”
Harry’s hand came down hard on the parchment, stalling Ron’s attempt at a quick exit. “She tried to sell me out to Voldemort.”
There was no sympathy to be found on Ron’s face, only a hint of disappointment—is that the best you’ve got? “I just had to witness my older brother picking up my ex-girlfriend to go off and do Merlin knows what.” The comment brought Harry’s memory to one of Lavender’s earlier, off-hand comments as to what Pansy’s theatrics had cost her that night and it was no longer quite Merlin-knows-what as much as Harry-knows-what-and-would-rather-he-didn’t. “Enjoy that, Head-Auror-Harry,” Ron saluted facetiously, adding Lavender’s abandoned paperwork to his stack with an inappropriate cheeriness.
~
“I’m listening,” she lied and looked around for the waitress again. “I can listen and want wings at the same time. It’s called multi-tasking.”
~
“I think we should start our own religion,” Gabriel said, swaying only a little. “Have you ever done that? Ho boy, it’s fun.”
“Yeah?” Anna said. “There’s a rule against that. I think.”
“Rules, schmules. Humans do it all the time. Why shouldn’t we?” Gabriel frowned momentarily, as if he found this thought troubling, then brightened. “Hey, we even have our own built-in triumvirate. How cool is that?”
“We’d have to be aspects of some sort.”
“Pfft. That’s easy.” Gabriel pointed at himself. “God of Awesomness.” He pointed at Anna. “God-”
“Goddess.”
“Right. Goddess of Really Great Hair.”
“I know, isn’t it?”
“Completely.” He pointed at Castiel. “God of – I don’t know. Sticks Up Asses or something.”
~
“I didn’t jump in front of anything,” the man maintained. “She just has terrible aim. I’m never standing next to you again.”
~
“Controlled,” he muttered. “Does that mean ‘distracted, bribed, and fed a brilliant cover story’? Or ‘shoved in a dark closet somewhere’?”
~
“French art-stand thing.” 
Alex had to think about that for a minute. “The—easel?”
“Yeah. The easel.” Wolf glared. “What, you think I’m fucking Diego Rivera?”
Alex shrugged innocently. “That’s your personal choice; I won’t judge.”
The meaning slowly dawned on Wolf, and then he glared even more fiercely. “Diego Rivera is dead, you know.”
“Oh.” Alex blinked. “Well. I’ll try not to judge, Wolf, but that is pretty messed up.”
~ “Rejoice! Or, if this is the first time you’ve ever done it, joice!”
~
I open my mouth to share the quip with her. Then carefully close it again before any sharing takes place, as I realise that before long I’ll be lying here asleep and there’s a drawer full of kitchen knives downstairs.
~
Well, technically speaking, there are some strings attached. Fortunately, they’re entirely decorative. We just like the way they look, swaying in the gentle breeze created by a million people simultaneously fainting from shock at the news that Portal is free. Now you have no reason not to try it.
“I have a reason,” some of you are probably typing into an angry email. “You see, sir, I own a Mac.”
~
Palace security turned out to be more attentive than I expected; I was only halfway through sneaking in when a large hand descended on my shoulder.
“It’s not what you think,” I said automatically, and then turned and looked up, and then up a bit more. “Oh. Perhaps it is.”
~ At about 10:00, Eliot did that thing where he showed up at the door without knocking and expected the force of his glare to open it up and it actually kind of worked. But that was only because Hardison had a thing about security cameras.
~ “I have considered it, and I am willing to let you eventually introduce me to that show with the guy that travels around in a box and fights the robots that look like salt shakers. Merry Christmas!”
~ Pepper exhales thoughtfully. “Or we could have sex.” Rhodey looks suitably startled. “Okay, I didn’t see that one coming,” he begins, “but that doesn’t mean I’m not adaptable.”
~ “Hence?  I thought you’d at least bust out a little Latin and maybe a semicolon or two - something like, ‘Dean, these children’s daily educational ritual concludes its diurnal routine promptly at three in the afternoon; ergo, they are free from the confines of the building.’”
~
Not “dramatic” like “I’ll slit my wrists if I gain another tenth of a pound. I swear I’ll do it this time, you’ll be sorry,” but “dramatic” like it’s part of a play.
~
It’s like Disney’s Tiki Room came to life, but only after you burned a corpse in it, and with Richard Nixon, Mark Twain, Henry Ford and Colin Powell in the audience, egging you on. Which would be really crazy, since three out of four of them are corpses themselves, or really awesome, because you’re hangin’ with zombie Bohemians.
~
“I need to do this and, no, I don’t need backup and, yes, I appreciate your telepathic offer.”
~
“Are you still seeing Donna?”
“She’s not invisible. Stop asking silly questions.”
~
“I don’t have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply…and I don’t want to have to dig past a certain someone to get it.”
~
“We’re a different sort of love. Like an old bourbon.”
“So now I’m old?”
“Aged to perfection, my dear.”
“How about that piece of jailbait at the party? Was that you trying to cork a younger vintage?”
“I see where you’re going with the metaphor…She was thinking about breast enhancement surgery and wanted my opinion, that’s all.”
~ When the gleaming metal monster emerged from the cloud and came to a sudden halt in midair, the first thought that ran through Chase’s mind was ah, then, a spaceship, followed by if this were really a heart attack there’d probably be some pain in my left arm, so I’m clear there. Of course, his arm was numb enough from the cold that it probably wasn’t feeling anything right now, but that was beginning to seem irrelevant compared with the broad range of alien abduction scenarios his mind was busily supplying him with.
~
“Gan ni niang!” Mal said, thumping his fist against the wall. “Lettin’ Jayne outta my sight for two whole days? Always a mistake.”
“I couldn’t agree more,” Wash said, dogging his heels as Mal clomped down the stairs. “Except for the part where not looking at Jayne for two whole days has greatly improved my quality of life. I think we should try it more often. How about every day?” Wash continued brightly. “Every day is no Jayne day. Hey, we already have a slogan!”
~
“So,” Mal said, clapping his hands together. “Who wants to head to the market in town, see about scaring up some brains for our zombified friend, here?” Five hands shot up. Two of ‘em belonged to little Kaylee. “Oh, it does warm the cockles of my heart to see this kind of volunteer spirit among my crew.”
Wash’s hand dropped. “Don’t you think you should have mentioned that there’d be cockle-warming? I’m not prepared to warm any cockles. No, no cockles for me, sir.”
“Wash?” Mal said.
“Yes, Captain?”
“Chin wo de pigu.”
Wash considered it for a moment. “I think I need Zoe’s permission for that, sir.”
“I’d rather he didn’t, sir,” Zoe said. Wash shrugged a ‘what are you gonna do?’
Mal sighed loudly. “Kaylee, go fetch me some brains, please?”
~
Mal reached for it. “What’s this?”
Reluctantly, Inara said, “Zombie powder.”
“I knew it!” Wash said. “He was zombified. I am vindicated. I feel the vindication.”
Simon hurried forward. “I’ll just go analyze this in the infirmary.”
“You do that,” he told Simon, then turned back to Inara. “Do I wanna know how you got ‘hold of this?”
Her smile was demure. “Trade secret.”
Mal peered at her cleavage curiously. “What else you got down there? Other than the obvious, I mean.”
“Captain?” Zoe said, coming to stand at his elbow. “I’d quit before both feet are in your mouth, sir.”
Mal leaned over to Zoe. “Am I in danger of that?”
“Perilously close, sir.”
~
“They’re not hooker boots!” she cries, reaching down to clutch them to her chest. “They’re protective leg wear.”
“You know what else is protective leg wear,” Nick says dryly, “Pants.”
~
“What are you talking about?” he asks, sounding offended as he pours some tourist a drink. “I am easily the prettiest person in this room.”
“Absolutely you are,” Cassie agrees as she waits for the cook to hand her over the sandwich and chips she’s waiting on, “assuming you don’t count at least three of the woman and that whole party of boys from Michigan.”
“They’re from Michigan,” Nick defends sullenly. “That’s an automatic disqualification.”

“If I weren’t, do you think I’d tell you the truth?”

“If you can’t figure out what she wants, then you’re hopeless,” the shorter boy asserted with a smirk. “Let me illustrate. You see, this is her—” He wriggled his left index finger. “And this is you—” He did the same with his right. “And this is what she wants—”
What ensued could only be described as an obscene, epileptic mashing of the fingers.
Horrified understanding was evident in the small O of Alex’s lips. “Your fingers are...”
~ Her hair was in a jumble and her feet were bare. Jarod noticed that her toenails were painted peach.
‘Quit it.’ Jarod thought to himself. ‘They are just toes. There is nothing sexy about toes.’ He tried to convince himself. It didn’t work. He decided to buy Parker some slippers the next time he had the chance.

She’s already sure that Mrs. Puckerman hates her, because she gets teary and miserable every time Quinn does something particularly Christian, and they’ve had to watch Schindler’s List twice already. It’s only been twenty-four hours since she moved in.
~ “Sarah, be a good Jew,” Mrs. Puckerman scolds, which Quinn has learned could mean any of a number of things: be appropriate, be smart, be pretty, be afraid of mustached men, be frugal, be clean, be careful not to get caught smoking weed in public places.
~ Puck looks horrified, which shouldn’t surprise her since it’s how Finn always looked when she cried, but it just makes her sob harder until at last he breathes out a sigh and reaches across to drag her toward him and she’s curls up with her face in his shirt, making puddles with her tears. “For shit’s sake, Fabray,” he grumbles, “she’s not going to be ugly, okay? Jesus, the girl’s got like mega dope steroid genes. She’s gonna have to go into intensive care so they can try and reign in the awesome.” He pauses as her crying subsides a little. “You’ve gotta deal with this hormone shit better, ‘cause it’s freaking me the fuck out, okay.”
~ “Are you bribing my sister to like you?” he laughs, putting the guitar aside. “What the shit, Fabray, that’s fucked up.”
“Like you don’t buy her licorice in exchange for her keeping silent about your stash of weed in the bathroom!”
“That’s extortion, not bribery,” he defends immediately, and Quinn rolls her eyes. Of course Puck would know what extortion means but not that women don’t have prostates. 
~
“If we’re going to be together, we’re going to be together,” she tells him without preamble. They’re not really the making-speeches type, anyway. “You can’t get with anyone else. No sexting, no cougars, nothing. Just me.”
He’s surprisingly honest: “I might fuck it up.”
“Probably,” she agrees. “Do you want to try anyway? This is a one-time offer.”
~ “Dude would not shut up,” Captain Winchester remarked. “He was all ‘you shall pay for this insolence’ and ‘your weapons cannot harm me’ when he wasn’t slamming us against the walls.”
“Can we get back to the beheading?” Jack inquired, okay, maybe a little impatiently.
“Shooting him didn’t work,” said Dr Winchester casually, “He had some sort of force shield or something.”
“Didn’t work very well against the machete,” added his brother, thoughtfully.
“We shot the snake thing, though.”
“Dude, that was sick. This place is crazy,” Said Captain Winchester to Doctor Winchester.
“Seriously,” said Doctor Winchester Captain Winchester.

“Mozzie votes?”
“More often than you’d think. Or would approve of.”

“No. Care to share?”
He waved his hand at her. “Numbers aren’t important. You can’t put a number on safety.”

“Oh, you’re right. That’s not idiotic at all.”

It seems almost impossible to out- “wha?” a show already titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but after muttering something about our lack of faith disappointing them, Japan outfitted the Turtles in flamboyant armor that looks like a LARP party on their way to a convention for Liberace Impersonators with an S & M fetish. Because giant, mutated turtles with mastery in martial arts don’t make sense without robo-armor and glittering codpieces.

So, you, along with your brothers and cousins, decide that you will build a huge-ass tower to reach the heavens so that you will be famous and what not. If you know the Old Testament you know that at this point God gets all pissed because... well, we actually don’t know. The story doesn’t really make it clear. If God just hates huge, pointless engineering projects then you’d think Dubai would have been hit by a meteor by now.

“You want to borrow my earrings? Now?”

“Don’t tell me to take care of her if you don’t get back,” Richard responded harshly, making his stand on this clear to his friend. “You’re coming back. I managed to fob her off on you, fair and square, and there’s no return policy. So you’d better come back here with both kids before your wife wakes up and starts cussing you out for being late.”
~
“Yes. If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that’s what we’d be to them.”

“What’s she talking about? I’m the head of this department.”

Imogen Poots – British actress. Expect to see her name in the running for a while, because it’s a lot of fun to say. 
~
Not because we’re hard to kill (well, with the exception of Steven Seagal). We’re not; we’re little more than tasty flesh bags waiting for an errant horn or claw to spill our guts like a meat pinata. No, we’re on top simply because we are so absurdly good at killing things ourselves. A good offense, as they say, is the best de-LOOK THERE’S A DUCK! MURDER IT!

Now consider the poor zombie. It lacks every single advantage that has kept humanity from being eaten to extinction. It wanders around in the open, it can’t use weapons, it can’t think or use strategy. It doesn’t even have the sense of self preservation to run and hide when it’s in danger. And, it’s made entirely out of food.

Maggie laughs bitterly. “You said it yourself. No one wants a card to this library.”
“That’s not true,” Jasper disagrees. “I know tons of guys—”
“Name one,” she cuts him off, challengingly.
With his fingers beneath her chin, he forces eye contact and boldly, hoarsely, says, “Me.”
~
“We’re missing sixth period,” Maggie says quietly. A part of her expects him to shoot up, panic, (because she’s more than a little positive he too hasn’t purposefully ditched a class in his life) and an even bigger part of her is shell-shocked when all he does is shrug his shoulders.
“Oh well,” Jasper says, but it really sounds like you’re worth it.

“SARAH! A little help!” He tried to push his assailant away, only to have the guy grab his hair in retaliation.
“Dr. Cole, you seem agitated.” The AI tried, “Would you like a cup of herbal tea to clam your nerves?”
“SARAH!” He chastised his house and the distraction gave Cole time to scratch at Carter’s face. “Helpful help, please.”
“Your sidearm is in the front closet.” She reminded him. “And, current media suggests shooting zombies in the head with a shotgun is the ideal way to defend yourself.”

Sure, Moses was a great leader, an emancipator of his people and a prophet. Most people don’t know that he also was the Biblical equivalent of Splinter Cell’s Sam Fisher--a well-honed killing machine, able to slay from the shadows without pity or remorse. Martin Luther King may have had a dream, but Moses had a body count. You can almost picture the scene: An Egyptian soldier is wailing on a hapless Hebrew when Moses, clothed in head-to- toe black, drops down from the ceiling. Moving with cat-like grace, he sneaks up behind the soldier and, taking his head in his hands, snaps the man’s neck with one savage twist. As the lifeless body slumps to the ground, Moses lights up a cigar. “Well,” he quips, “looks like someone bit off more than he could Jew.”
~ It should be pointed out that even after his death, Elisha continued to kick ass. II Kings 13:20-21 tells us that when a dead body was thrown into his tomb and touched Elisha’s bones, it sprang back to life. It’s unknown whether Elisha had this power in life, as well as death, but we like to think he did and that he had the habit of killing his victims with bears, resurrecting them, and then promptly re-summoning the bears to kill them, again. He’d just repeat the whole thing over and over until he got bored.
~ At some point, a troublemaker named Korah and 250 supporters banded together and aired a series of complaints about the fact that they were wandering aimlessly in the desert. God listened carefully to their complaints, weighed their points, then made the earth eat them alive. The text does not make it clear whether or not the earth made that “OM NOM NOM” sound, so scholars are forced to speculate.
~ Han Solo in particular seems to understand every alien language out there, including Wookie-talk, Greedo-talk and Jabba-talk, which seems a little out of character since he doesn’t seem like the type to listen to Rosetta Stone while flying around the galaxy. But fuck if he’s going to talk to them in their own language. He’s a space American and you’re going to listen to him in space English or go home. ~
Also, the Empire seems to have constructed the Walkers without considering that most militia battles are not fought thirty stories above ground, so the tank commanders spend the entire day on Hoth with their chins to their chests trying to see what the hell they’re supposed to be shooting at. The only reason the rebels had such trouble with them is because the speeders insisted on using what Luke referred to as “Attack Pattern Delta”, which appears to mean, “fly directly at the enemy in the one single spot where they are able to shoot us.”
~
For instance, when the main reactor fails in Star Trek they call it a “warp core breech” and it happens so often there’s an entire page listing times it has happened on the Star Trek wiki. Seriously, it was like every third episode. Their only safety measure against this was, hilariously, to “eject” the warp core out into space to allow it to explode (taking anyone nearby with it) and leave the ship utterly disabled. You know, like how when you have engine trouble on your car, your only option is to punch a button that makes your engine go flying out of the hood. And do we even need to talk about the Death Star? Or what happens when their main reactor takes any kind of damage?

The shell, Arthur said, was unbreakable, and then he’d given Merlin a long list of objects in the room that either required replacing (from being shattered) or sharpening.
~
Arthur, who had apparently gotten bored enough to take up whittling, glanced up from the tiny and rather intricate unicorn he was fashioning out of a piece of smooth, unknotted pine.  
~ “She’s purple-pink, obviously it’s a girl,” Arthur said, holding the dragon more tightly.  “And no, no, she’s just a baby — she couldn’t possibly harm any — “ Several hours later, after Merlin had first put out the small fire the dragon had set to Arthur’s fringe and then been forced to reveal himself as a wizard when Arthur demanded he repair the damage and then been forced to reveal himself as a slightly hapless wizard when it took three tries, Arthur still appeared not to have learned his lesson. “You knew?” Merlin asked, gathering the dragon up into his arms to keep her from making another go of setting the heir to Camelot on fire.  “You knew, all this time?” Arthur kept pawing at his hair, checking it over and over again.   “Of course I knew,” he sighed.  “You’re an appallingly crap liar, you know, Merlin.” Merlin considered for a moment the potential consequences of letting the dragon go and allowing her to set all of Arthur on fire as opposed to just his fringe, but there was always the potential he might grow to regret it later. “Look, anyway,” Merlin said, since it didn’t seem like Arthur was planning on having him killed for practicing sorcery, “the point is, I’m not sure we should keep it.”

The first two seasons aren’t a complete waste of time, but they’re dangerously close, and even the best episodes are some degree of flawed or derivative. So unless your tolerance for nonsensical plots, general silliness, and lots of sex and angst masquerading as mature storytelling is epically high, I’d skip the first two seasons completely and head straight for the brilliant, brutal Children of Earth.

But hey, it’s worth it because everyone likes doctors. Or they did 50 years ago. Speaking of which, if you’re smart enough to be in the top 10 percent of your organic chemistry class you’re probably smart enough to invent a time machine and go to a period where doctors were both respected and compensated.  ~
But then you have a character in a series that deals exclusively with the supernatural, who completely forgets from one episode to the next that they are in fact characters in a series dealing with the supernatural. Take Indiana Jones, so quickly dismissing the idea of psychic alien skulls in the fourth movie, in spite of having witnessed firsthand the supernatural powers of the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail and Indian spirit rocks. Pretty much every artifact the man digs up has magical powers, this should not be new territory for him.
~ Then you have the selective skeptics, like in the show Medium, where everyone accepts the psychic detective’s ability, but somehow still manages to second-guess her tips. Just to be clear, they believe she is communicating with ghosts but they question the reliability of the ghosts’ testimony. That’s like watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and believing everything but the “ninja” part.

He was not happy with the puzzles set before him. He had been struck by an exploding shell. The war and everyone in it seemd to have vanished, though a conflict of that size should have been a rather difficult thing to misplace. The light had not changed in this place since he had come here, although it must have been hours since the explosion. And the only other thing in the world was an immense, impossible vegetable. He prayed that when he opened his eyes again he would either find himself in some sort of respectable afterlife or returned to the familiar misery of the trenches.

“Point is we’re not letting you go in there by yourself.” Elliot folded his arms across his chest. “Don’t you know it’s dangerous meeting up with people you found on the internet?”
“You don’t see me dissing your friends.”
“My friends aren’t blue elves.”
~ Elliot cracked his knuckles and then the guys stood up. Hardison looked up and up. He didn’t think they made white dudes that big.
“Go, Hardison, I got this,” Elliot said. Well, if Elliot had this, Hardison wasn’t about to take it away from him.
~ “Please do not be lecturing me on computer security, man, I was at your computer the other day, and you have an AOL account over there. An AOL account. Do you know how ‘90s that is? Who even, in this day and age--I don’t even know where to begin—”

“So, this is revenge.” Eliot seemed happy to be able to encapsulate the situation neatly.

Still, he now knew that there was an FBI truck at the corner, another in the back alley, a car full of thugs, there were no other words for them, absolute thugs in a dark blue sedan just around the other corner, and a mystifying Toyota Matrix full of Arabic looking men around the corner from that. Terrorists! had been his first wild guess, but that was pretty un-pc, and also pretty stupid, actually. Foreign mafia had been his next guess, followed by money lenders, but actually, it seemed unlikely that terrorists, mafia, or money lenders would be caught dead in a Toyota Matrix. Then one of them had broken out a walkie talkie, and as they were, ridiculously, parked right under a streetlight, Hardison had no problem determining that the reason he hadn’t been able to get a good radio signal from them was because they were using children’s walkie-talkies with RadioShack stamped on them. Shortly after that they had broken out the travel Parcheesi and he’d given up trying to find a box to fit them in at all, and decided to place them firmly in the “Very weird, not a threat to anyone, and probably in need of assistance themselves,” category.
~ Behind them was a bank of computer equipment advanced enough to tell him that 1) these were not just the cops, and 2) he really really needed to go to the Tech Fair next month and buy that pretty little camera array he could see over the man’s shoulder, it was utterly sweet.   ~ “I will have your skin, Hardison,” she shouted. “I will make it into a coat, which I will wear, so that I don’t freeze to death, do you hear me? You know that scene in Star Wars, Hardison?” Parker asked.  “Uh... very probably?” Hardison offered.  “The one in the blizzard, where they cut the animal open, and rip its guts out, and sleep inside it for the warmth?”
~ “There might be a few police cars between you and here, okay? Try to avoid those, if you can.” 
~ “We’re in! Go!” Eliot flapped his hands at him in a way that made Hardison want to explain to him just how very un-macho that looked.
~ Parker seemed to be wearing a very form fitting waitress outfit, and Hardison took a moment to give it the respect it was due.

“So. Birmingham Bash?” Eliot asked.
Nate shook his head and pulled a mug off the shelf. “Not enough players. He’s already seen the three of you.”
“Two-fisted Galoot?”
“I don’t think we can get that much mylar on a weekend.”

“I’d take offence to that, but I have a feeling I’d have to jump like four levels of clearance just to ask what you’re talking about.”
~
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you. See, I have this small, somewhat impressive shiv I learned to make from one of thirty prisoners named Gord, and I’m in the position, unfortunately, where I would have to use it. I give you my word though that I would cut you in a manner that you would not bleed out too quickly and your recovery would be a matter of weeks, not months. Under the circumstances, I’d say that’s rather considerate.”
~
“You can’t work there. You’d be the lowest on the totem pole. You ever see a totem pole? You’ve got like six people and an eagle standing on your head.”
~
“Thank you to all of you who filled out the comment cards…and to all of you who didn’t because you want to spare my fragile feelings.”
~
“With a nickname like ‘Pumpkin’, you’d be better off hanging out with Big Man than Brenda.”
~
“We don’t have any first aid kits. If someone gets hurt, it’s cheaper to just hire a new worker.”
~
“Did I tell him? Are you kidding me? That would be like posting it on my Facebook page…if I had a Facebook page and a desire to share intimate life details with people I would avoid on the street.”
~
“Hello,” she responded evenly. Jo waited, knowing that the tone of her voice would (should) speak for itself.
“Ooooh,” he said, and she heard the recognition of his failure in his own tone. “Hey.”
“Yeah,” she drawled. “Hey.”
“So there have been some changes.”
“Seems like,” she agreed pleasantly.
He didn’t venture a response for a moment. Then, “How mad are you?”
“Pretty,” she admitted in the same reasonable tone.
~ Hotch took a bite of chicken-fried steak and just managed not to moan in pleasure. Seriously. How was it possible for something to taste this good? Fat, said the rational part of his mind. Lots and lots of fat. Hotch scowled. Oh shut up, he told that part of his brain petulantly, cutting off another piece.
Morgan raised an eyebrow at him. “Would you like to be alone with your meal, Hotch?” he asked.
“You shut up, too,” he mumbled, not bothering to explain when his colleague’s eyebrow went up another notch.
~
“I will not go in there. I’m not setting foot on linoleum. If you’re going to shoot me, you’re going to do it somewhere difficult to clean.”
~
“A sandwich without meat is just lonely bread.”
~ “Five minutes,” Adam said, disgust showing in his voice. “Five minutes, that’s how long you’ve been back in town.”
“Yes, that’s right, because you’re not remotely capable of dropping yourself in it without my help,” Duncan drawled.
Martha closed her eyes. “This is going to be one of those stories, isn’t it?” she said. “The kind that involves aliens and Armageddon.”
~
“This is totally unnecessary,” I overhear him informing the paramedics.
“Sir, you can’t stand up; we need to make sure you don’t move and cause further damage to your neck or spine.”
“I can’t stand up because I’m wearing a fat suit!” Santa insists as they load him into the bus.
~
Under the table, the toe of Pepper’s shoe impacted his ankle in precisely the right angle to elicit the most pain.
~
“Yeah. Pretty much. Look, she started it. I guess I wasn’t thinking, I don’t know what I was thinking. I don’t know what she was thinking. It was definitely a mutual session of not thinking at all.”
~ “Why is Matt wearing a pink shirt?”
Matt looked up again. “I’m sitting right here and you can’t ask me?”
“I assumed you were busy.”
“He’s not. He’s just writing new protest chants because he doesn’t like the ones we have.”
“The vast majority of people here are professional writers and we’re stuck with ‘We won’t write until it’s right’?”
~
“I’m fine,” Matt repeats. If he keeps saying that in a firm tone, maybe Danny will start listening to him eventually. Like a dog. Though Matt was never good with dogs, which may be why Danny isn’t listening to him now.
~
“You got a minute?”
“I’ve got six days and twenty-two-and-a-half hours worth of minutes,” said Matt. “And how cool would it be to be able to do the math on that at any given moment and just snap it out?”
“For definitions of cool meaning ‘completely lame’, yeah.”
~
“I’m going to say something here, and what you’re going to do is sit there and not come completely off the rails until I’m done, okay?”
“Oh-kay . . .” said Matt. This wasn’t Danny’s upset face, which a lot of people mistook for his calm face but which definitely wasn’t, so this couldn’t possibly be too bad.
~
“Okay,” said Danny. “Can I do my thing now?”
“Can I make fun of you in my head while you do it?”
~
“Just so you know, if that whole thing had actually been necessary, hypothetically speaking, and I were actually suffering pain and . . . suffering, I would hypothetically accept your apology.”
Danny blinked. “Don’t you make a living as a writer?”
“Shut up and accept my hypothetical acceptance.”
~
Squirming in his tuxedo, Tim Drake tugged helplessly at his bow tie-not a clip-on, but a real, honest-to-god bow tie. Alfred had insisted.
~
“Well,” Tim said reluctantly. Very reluctantly. “It does seem to be doing Bruce some good.” Nightwing furrowed his brow. “He’s more relaxed. They’re actually...” He dropped his voice. “Having fun. He gets a kick out of thwarting her little schemes. She’s...she’s...”
“What?” he asked darkly.
“Made him laugh. At least twice.”
“Oh, my God.” Nightwing stared, then dove for his case. “She’s drugging him!”
Tim caught his arm. “Don’t you think I already sent samples to the lab? He’s clean.”
~
“Dude. Don’t hate me because I’ve got way more skills than you,” he said.
“Oh, when did the hallucinations start?”
“Didn’t hallucinate the score,” Chad said, pointing up where the final score was still lit.
“I didn’t hallucinate you on the bench the whole first half,” Troy answered.
~
“If this makes you uncomfortable…” Chad started. It sounded like he probably meant it as a nice way of letting Ryan off the hook, but the crowd around them went oooooh as if it had been a dare. Which made Chad raise his eyebrows and smirk, which made Ryan pretty determined to show him up.
~
“Ryan! You disappeared, I was afraid I’d have to tell Mom and Dad you died or something, and -- “ She broke off, leaned closer, and frowned. “That is your ‘I just got some’ smirk.”
~
He says, in a conspiratorial whisper, “I’m pretty sure Matt won’t notice if your toenails are a different pink than your fingernails.”
~
“Of course we’re still on for tonight. I’m wearing open-toed shoes.”
“Ah, I see. So you came over to paint your toenails while I wasn’t even home. That’s totally normal.”
“I was going to ask if you liked dusty rose better than regular rose, but you weren’t here.”
“Went with the regular?”
“This is dusty,” she snapped.
“Oh. Right, I see that now.” He managed not to look at her like she was a lunatic. Chad found that fairly impressive, actually.
She gave him her sweetest smile. “I know you just got home, but be a dear and get me a latte?”
“Sure thing, babe.” He looked over at Chad. “Corky, be a good little pledge and go get her a latte.”
Chad glared. “I hate you both,” he said.
~
“Second, it’s not cheating, because Ryan and I aren’t, you know, dating. We’re just friends.” She gave him a sassy raised eyebrow. “With some awesome benefits,” he amended.
~
“So normally no one actually gives a crap that I’m gay. But for some reason half the guys thought it was hilarious that I was at a skin bar, and the other half were totally freaked. Gooey bought me two lapdances, he was so amazed at the idea of a guy not getting turned on by a naked chick. He kept waiting for my gayness to wear off.”
~
“You. Had. A. Plan,” she repeats in a dangerously even tone.
Pete can feel his vibes flipping out, screaming Danger, danger, Will Robinson! It still takes him a second to connect the dots. Oh. She’s taking about what he said before the mob came through. The recollection is a little fuzzy; being in a coma will do that to a fellow. He clears his throat awkwardly and forces a smile. “Yeah, it… uh.”
“What,” she begins, trying to keep calm. But Myka doing her trying-to-keep-calm face looks remarkably similar to Myka’s I’m-gonna-kill-you face, and it’s amazing how well that latter one freaks him out. “What, exactly, was your plan?”
~
It’s cataloguing day at the Warehouse, and as Myka has learned the hard way, a Bored Pete is not a Safe Pete.
~
“What do you think of Jacob?”
There’s a pregnant pause. “He has good hygiene?”
Myka blinks. “Hygiene?”
“Yeah, I mean, he was well-groomed. Clean-shaven. Nice, fitted suit. His haircut was so perfect I wonder if it was molded in place.”
“So you think he’s good looking?”
“Whoa, wait. I never said that. I said he was well-groomed. You can have a dog that’s well-groomed.”
“Are you comparing my date to a dog?”
Pete halts at the end of the aisle. “Why do I feel this is becoming a conversation I can’t win?”
~
“You liar! You big, fat, hypocritical, unbelievably stupid, self-sacrificing liar! How could you do this to me?!”
Pete cradles his nose in one hand. “Aren’t you supposed to be glad I’m alive?”
~
“I see that your features are regular and symmetrical, conforming well to current Western standards of beauty…”
“Ha! She called you pretty,” Sam interjected with glee, making kissy faces as he rocked back in his chair.
“…but other than as predictors of health, I find such details irrelevant.”
~
“You never said how handsome he is,” Jess says.
“I’d be a little bit disturbed if he had,” Dean says, flicking an uncomfortable look toward Sam.
~
“There is enough tape in there to feed a small island population for a year,” he said. “Provided I had a small island and they could eat tape. Do I have an island?”
“No,” she said.
“Are you sure? I seem like someone who should own an island,” he said. “I should buy one. Look into islands for sale. I could use a secret base. Maybe in a volcano.” He held up a hand as though she had objected. “I know, a bit impractical.”
“The air conditioning bill alone...” she said.
“But think of the money saved in the winter,” he interjected.
~
“You would like me to engage my privacy function?” the AI asked, sounding somewhat affronted. Pepper often remembered the days when she didn’t know AIs could be affronted.
~
Stupid zombies. Eliot really hated zombies. People you could fight. Zombies just growled and chewed a lot. Or, at least, they did until you shot them/set them on fire/bashed their head in/dropped a truck on them. After that, they just stank up the place something awful.
~
He just never seemed to think about doing laundry until it had crossed the line from dubious to sentient.
~
“I did knock. But you didn’t answer, so I came in through the ventilation system.”
~
The good thing about Nate’s newfound sobriety is that his text messages are now 100 times more legible than they used to be. It’s a lot easier to figure out what he means when there is a correlation between what he wants to say and the keys his fingers hit. The bad thing is that Nate’s messages now contain 100 times more smiley faces and exclamation points than they used to.
~
Because seriously, Nathan Ford is one crazy laugh, and a carefully planned murder away from officially becoming a supervillain. Eliot probably shouldn’t point that out any time soon though. You really can’t afford to give people ideas around here, can’t even make a point, without someone drawing up plans.
~
“Do either of you know where I can get a cast of a bear’s head?” Sophie looks between them both, and honestly, Eliot couldn’t have said whether that expression was hopeful, or insane? 
‘Don’t ask, don’t ask, don’t ask.’ Hardison apparently isn’t listening to his internal monologue. “What do you want with—” Hardison stops; maybe he is learning after all. “No, you know what, the things you do in your free time, I do not need to know.”
~
“You’re not building a robot double of me,” Eliot tells him again, in the special voice he uses for cutting off the conversation entirely. Hardison looks put out, he probably had more arguments, he’d probably been thinking about it for the whole damn week.
~
“I am cowed by both her beauty and her anger. The full force of her gaze is like being chased by a rabid yet sparkly bear.”
~
The bomb had a voice that was loud, high-pitched, and practically sparkled with friendliness. “Detonation in 3 minutes,” it announced. “Area of detonation: 5 square miles. Please locate the nearest emergency exit and run for your lives.” “Least it’s courteous,” Rose muttered.
~
Dean didn’t know how many yards constituted minimum safe distance when you were face-to-face with a seven-foot-tall skeleton, but he was fairly certain he wanted more than none. He surveyed the reaper from the base of his inky black robe to the pinholes of cerulean light that served as eyes inside his hooded skull. Kept finding his attention pulled back to the yawning lack of the dark vestment.  GOOD AFTERNOON. Dean wasn’t sure the figure before them had spoken, but he was aware of the words, nonetheless. He pivoted on the stiff hinges of his alarm until he faced Sam. “Did he just say ‘Good afternoon’?” Sam’s mouth opened and shut twice. Dean paused, leaned towards the confidentiality of his brother’s ear. “Do I say hello back?” Sam shook his head wordlessly.  Dean straightened, cleared his throat, tried on a grimace of a smile. “Uh, hey?”  THERE WAS A DELAY. Death’s scythe swung forward in a vague, apologetic arc, and Dean’s eyes tracked the whisper-thin transparent blade as he stepped backward out of its path. “Whoa.”  THURSDAYS ARE SOMEWHAT HECTIC.  Dean exchanged a look with Sam, frowned. “I’m sorry to hear that.” Sam tugged viciously at his elbow. “You’re sorry to hear that?” he whispered incredulously. Dean made a helpless gesture to indicate the situation had spiralled beyond his skill-set, and Sam fairly shoved him aside.
~
Sam froze. When he turned back to Dean he appeared to be approaching a nuclear reaction of some kind, his features an alarming composite of amusement and rage. “Did that reaper just call me ‘spoiled’?”  Dean braced for a secondary fatal detonation. Sam took a step forward. He jabbed a finger in Dean’s direction, addressed Death directly. “I spent a hundred odd Tuesdays watching my brother die in Broward-fucking-County, Florida. Explain to me exactly how that’s spoiled.” AH, YES. BROWARD COUNTY. AN INTRIGUING COSMIC WRINKLE. THE AUDITORS WERE EXTREMELY VEXED. THE REQUIRED INJUNCTIONS ALONE RESULTED IN UNIVERSAL DELAYS.  Sam was far from similarly impressed. “I’m sorry, what?” I HEAR THE PAPERWORK WAS EXTENSIVE.  “The paperwork?” Sam repeated, and Dean saw the moment of ignition just in time. He almost didn’t catch him, had only a fraction of a second to throw an arm out across Sam’s chest. Death held his ground, watched with patient interest as Sam scrabbled frantically against Dean’s efforts to restrain him.  “Ho! Easy there, Sugar Ray.” Dean marched his fuming brother back, kept him going until there was an appreciable distance between Sam and the object of his wrath. “I don’t think we punch Death, okay? I don’t think that’s something we do. Why don’t you stand back here and chill for a second?” Sam was trembling beneath his hands. Dean slapped at his brother’s chest. “‘S okay. It’s alright. You alright?” Sam shook his head. He took some deep, shuddering breaths. “I can’t believe this is happening.” “Yeah, benchtime, buddy. You need to sit down, stick your head between your knees or something. Lemme talk to this dude, see what’s what.” Dean left him there, headed back towards the looming robed figure. He rubbed his hands together as he approached Death. “Okay, so Sam’s gonna hang back there for a while and…deal.”
~
TIME CAN BE…MISLEADING HERE.  Dean perused the impressively large, pale grey horse standing suddenly before him and was inclined to agree. “No shit. When did he get here?” HE IS ALWAYS HERE. THE MECHANICS OF EXISTENCE ARE… COMPLICATED.
~
“Have it your way,” Gondorff said, a touch of disappointment to his voice. “And don’t worry, my boys know what they’re doing, it’ll look bad but there’ll be no permanent scarring.”
“Permanent what?” Neal spun around, seeking clarification, when suddenly he was jabbed with something and the world grew dim.
~
“Whoa. Okay, seriously, we planning on raiding a small country?” The table is covered with guns and ammunition. She merely lifts one eyebrow to his look, and slides her gaze back to the rifle. “We’re supposed to be going in light and efficient.”
She flashes him a flirty smile. “I can do heavy and efficient.”
He smirks. “You know, when you say stuff like that, I get distracted by dirty thoughts.”
“You get dirty thoughts when I walk through the door,” she accuses.
“Hey, it’s not my fault! You have this sexy little wiggle to your hips. It’s like you’re teasing me when you do that. And other things. Like breathing.”
~
“Here,” Ron said, lifting the paper crown and setting it on hers head “I abdicate. You’re the queen and I am your crumble servant.”
“My crumble servant?” Hermione giggled.
“Yeah,” Ron nodded, “I’ll serve you crumble whenever you want it.”
~
“What d’you want us to do for your birthday then Ron?” she asked.
“Gettin’ married on mine,” Ron mumbled as he crawled into bed sleepily.
Hermione blinked and stared at him. “What did you just say?”
Ron waved his arm at a small box on her dressing table and spoke his answer half into the pillow. “I’ll give you your ‘gagement ring tomorrow. S’posedta do it tonight but I don’t wanna propose drunk. S’not right is it?” Ron’s head suddenly lifted up from the pillow and he looked completely alert and focused. “Promise you’ll look surprised when I do it!” He saw the stunned expression of Hermione’s face and his lazy smile came back, eyes falling closed and head dropping back down onto the pillow again. “Yeah, exactly like that.”
~
“I can’t believe you brought a girl to ‘The Lair’.”
“I can’t believe you guys call it ‘The Lair’.”
~
“I think you saw enough of me during that ‘alleged’ photoshoot. Was there even film in that camera?”
“It’s digital.”
~
“I just wanted to say that I’m sorry for my actions and I will always admire and love you, just from a distance of 200 ft.”
~
“Receipts? My TV fell off the same truck yours did.”
~
“Let’s not talk about our salaries or how many people we’ve slept with, because both those numbers will make you sad.”
“Well, when you get back, you’d better start paying for some dinners because apparently you’re making mad cheddar.”
“Let’s hope my plane doesn’t crash so your last words to me won’t be ‘mad cheddar’.”
~
“I’d like to say I’m very happy you’re back together…and if I can figure out a way to do that and sound sincere, I will.”
~
“I’d be rich and famous and living in a giant mansion all by myself. The only people I’d be able to talk to would be my genetically engineered monkey butler and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.”
~
"We've caught a weird one here Mykes. There's something weird going on with these people and I can't help but feel that if you were here we'd already have this solved and be on our way to get some pie, or cookies. There's this guy here that makes the most awesome killer cookies. They had like chunks of walnuts and just melted in your mouth it was…" but he stopped as he remembered that he was talking to a machine. "Myka, please call me. Please?"
~ "Of course I remember your cousin, Wolfgang." Sophie raised an eyebrow, "How could I forget?"
"That name's not as funny in Germany," Dani told her
~
"You'll have to," I said, not unkindly, just as Lucy asked, "What do you mean 'both of you?'"
"He hurt his back again," Cain answered, bulldozing my own answer of "Nothing, Lu, don't worry."
~
"I am not taking a bloody nap!" billowed from the open window. "Get out of my room, you god damned leech!"
Peter's grimace was tolerantly good-natured. "I shall come down and join you soon."
~
"I never hated you." Zane replied vehemently, causing Jo's pulse to skip. His voice softened as he continued. "I should, you know? But I didn't. I don't. And sometimes, I really, really don't."
~ "It followed me into the shower." Jo ground out.
"There's footage of you naked on this thing?" Zane's grin widened, fingers tightening around the squealing robot. "How can I help?"
Jo frowned, now freaked out for a different reason. "You didn't send this into my shower?"
Far from insulted at the accusation, Zane smirked as he replied. "Jo, if I made any plans involving you and showers, they would involve you, showers and me."
~ His expression seemed to say, 'I could think of something to arrest you for right now, but I don't feel like doing the paperwork to book you, so how about you move along?'
~ "You will run the assault course three times for trying to attack a fellow teammate. You will run it another three times for not being able to do so successfully."
~
"That hand goes so much as an inch lower and you'll be wearing this glass of champagne."
~ "No one around here had Wifi, but I talked the girl at the Burger Bar into letting me plug into her router." Dean raised an eyebrow and smirked at Sam's word choice. "Dude, shut up," Sam snapped.
"Didn't say anything," Dean said. "You were careful right, with all your antivirus protection?"
~
"Dude, I'm telling you, Indiana Jones could have kicked Han Solo's ass any day."
"Han Solo had a blaster and a very loose sense of morals! Indiana Jones—"
"Had a whip, man. The only guy who brings a whip to a firefight is the one that's going to win by sheer bad-assery."
A snort followed this declaration. "Yeah, because making an enemy of Jabba the Hut and taking on the Death Star with a barely flying hunk of crap metal isn't at all indicative of bad-assery."
"It is, but not nearly as bad-ass as taking on the freakin' Nazis with a freakin' whip, dude! Nazis."
"Han Solo took on the Empire. The one that pretty much conquered the whole universe? The Nazis never even conquered all of Europe."
~
“Your incompetence knows no bounds. Have you some sort of mental affliction?”
“Probably. I’m looking into it, sire.”
~
They were on the stairs before either said anything. "So…" Polly began.
"Quite," he responded.
"Who would have thought…"
"Extraordinary, isn't it?"
"She'll rot her teeth if this continues."
"Please scold him for the both of us."
"I do wonder how though."
"Perhaps he is keeping her in supply?"
"Do you think the usual?"
"So long as…"
"Good heavens, I hope not!"
After so long, actual verbal communication between the two of them was often perfunctory at best, and indecipherable to anyone else.
~
"Michaels," Ohlman ordered. "Do some damage." Michaels started to unload his pockets into McKay's hands since he was closest.
"My hands are very important," Rodney immediately argued. "I'm important. I can't be blown to bits on accident."
Michaels smiled like a shark. "I don't make mistakes with my equipment, doc. And I never, ever explode early."
~
"But you did sleep with him."
"Geographically, yes, there was a 'with' involved. In a local, proximity-related sense."
~
"I even agreed to dispense with the 'hurt-her, die-painfully' brother speech. And I had such a good one, too. It had cheese graters."
~
"Living in sin?" Charlie asked.
"I was going to say banging like a box of Bludgers, but there it is," Jessie shrugged.
~ "We gave it a shot, okay? But just because we pretend that we're compatible, doesn't mean that we are! Schrodinger's cat isn't opening the box and seeing if the cat is alive or dead, it's the fact that the cat's alive or dead without the universe's say-so or seeing, and no matter how much we say we work it doesn't change the fact that what's happened in the box has happened, with or without our consent!"
"You're breaking up with me," Leonard says, voice stiff, stilted. "You're breaking up with me, and your reason is Schrodinger's cat?"
~
Nonetheless, the appropriate waivers were in fact located, and despite Ted's expectations to the contrary, the paperwork did include clauses about accidental zombification, with subclauses cross-referencing certain other policies regarding containment.
~ "Well, now there are thirteen zombies," Phil said. "Wait, there's the mailroom guy. Fourteen zombies."
"And one of them has a gun," Lem added helpfully.
Vi was exasperated. "Why didn't the security guard use it? We've done trainings on what to do when one of your experiments breaks free."
"Those usually involved biohazard suits and flamethrowers," Ted told her. "At least they don't seem to be...actively harming anyone," he added, peering closely at the screen. "Look, they haven't even eaten the security guard's brain yet--no, there they go."
~
“So, I’ve swept for bugs, but these guys are good. The only way you can be 100% sure they’re not listening is to burn the place down.”
~
“We’re dead if we stay here. Right now, I’d say our life expectancy is somewhere between a fly and a fly with a heart condition.”
~
“This is how it’s going to work: I’m going to ask you questions, and Britt here is going to punch you in the face every time you don’t answer them.”
“How the hell do you—” He was cut off by a swift fist connecting with his cheek.
“He didn’t ask you a question,” Britt said. “You’ve got to answer a question not to get hit. See?”
~
"All offices and hallways in GD are monitored in some way," he began, "and unless you engage sonic protocols you never know if someone may be listening or recording. Sonic protocols don't always work either because Mansfield is notified anytime anyone engages them. This room and the other treatment rooms aren't monitored. No cameras and no microphones."
Jo looked at him, confused. "So if I make you scream in pain, no one will come running?"
"No," he said, "so when you give me some answers about what's going on, they'll stay here between us."
~
And it's freaking out publishers, too—who we hear have scheduled emergency meetings to Discuss This Event and Then Do What Exactly, I Mean, It's Book Publishing, Let's Continue This Discussion Over Lunch and Then Maybe Some Drinks, Hmm, I Guess Maybe Authors Might Have Questions About Their Royalty Statements Down the Road, Oh Boy.

“Come to bed?” His smile was half hope, half seduction.
~
“You know,” she said, running her fingers through his damp hair, “they say it doesn’t count if you say it in bed.”  “It bloody well counts,” he mumbled into her shoulder.
~
“Still drinking in the middle of the day, I see. You know what, good for you. Liver’s pickled any way, right? So why not?”
~
"My scanner tried to kill Larry." Frankly, Zane didn't blame the scanner.
~
Clark tried to ignore the feeling of her pressed all over him, watching her skirt inch higher and higher with alarm, and hurriedly screwed his eyes shut. I'm not going to try and x-ray through my own eyelids, I am not going to try and x-ray through my own eyelids.
~ “I was on a type of sabbatical,” Castiel said. “And do not condescend to me, Dean Winchester.”
Dean was unapologetic. “I’m just saying, the whole martyr thing is overrated.” 
~
“Compare wing size, quote the Bible at each other, play bingo. I’m sure there’s something you angelic types find to pass the time.”
“Existence is nearly always under some sort of threat,” Castiel said, leaning comfortably into the leather of the back seat. “There is little time for idle pursuits. Time…only has meaning for linear souls.”
~
Castiel smiled. “I’m going to fuck him,” he said.
“I need you to remember to add the word ‘up’ to the end of that phrase, Cas,” Dean said. “Please, man, for me. Okay?”
~
“Is it a job?” Parker asks eagerly. It’s been a slow week, and they’re all wired.
“It’s a one-man job,” Nate says.
“No such thing,” Eliot says sturdily, as he inserts himself smoothly between Nate and the door in less than the time it takes to blink. Nate levels a glare at him. Eliot glares right back, just this side of insubordination.
~
Eliot’s scowling the way he does before he punches something and, knowing Eliot, he’s probably itching to get his hands on cancer and Hardison thinks, perhaps a bit wildly, that Eliot may have finally met something he can’t beat into submission –then he takes a second look at Eliot’s determined stance, his clenched fist, and isn’t so sure.
~
Sophie stages a nativity play with a kind of mad frenzy - inexplicably taking it upon herself to act out all the parts -except that of the sheep, which she outsources to a reluctant Parker. “Baaing is beneath me,” says Sophie, by way of explanation, and Hardison thinks that has to be the weirdest thing he’s heard all day.
That is, until he hears Parker’s impression of a sheep.
~
He lays a particular emphasis on the word repentent and Hardison finds it so easy to forget that Nate trained as a priest, until he comes out with random facts like this.
~ Alec's breath slams out of his gut. There was one blurry picture of this man on the internet, and it was there for about ten seconds at 3am London time four years ago before huge sections of the network shut down in the biggest crash in history. Alec saw it.
Now, the man is looking at him with a curl to one side of his mouth that might be a smile. "I'm Nick Fury," he says. "Director of S.H.I.E.L.D." There's a pause, and Alec tries to think of something smartass to say, but he's got nothin'. S.H.I.E.L.D. It's like the frickin' Death Star, and not the one with the whoops-blow-up button, but the fully armed and operational battle station. He swallows.
"Alec," Nick Fury says. "We have a problem." His first thought is, Oh sweet Jesus, let it not be with me, but his second thought is that it couldn't be, because if S.H.I.E.L.D. thought he was a problem, he would not be looking at this man. He might, if he were real lucky, be looking at a cell wall.
~
The pantry is full of gummi bears, Cool Ranch Doritos and Zebra Cakes; the fridge is full of orange soda. This scares him for about half a second, and then he shrugs and takes out a bottle. They stole him in the middle of the night, and he's going to worry that they know his favourite snacks?

They had gotten mostly naked when Eliot opened the closet door.
"Augh!" he said, slamming it shut again.

Unfortunately, his feline state persisted. Perhaps if he tried LaBerge's mnemonic induction of lucid dreams operation, or the cycle adjustment technique—those would take several days to properly implement, but there was an appeal to the ability to control his mind even while asleep—he opened his eyes and continued to be a cat.
‘Remain calm,’ he told himself. ‘Apply the scientific method. Observation: I am a cat, while yesterday I recall being a human. Memory tampering? Have I always been a cat? Psychosomatic break? Alien technology? Am I now an Animorph?’
For several moments he focused on his human body without success. Neither did his attempts at thought-speak prove fruitful.

Penny rolled her eyes. "Yes, Leonard, I think I recognize my own boyfriend."
"Penny, he's a cat," Leonard said. "A cat. Small and furry and also a cat." Sheldon, perched primly on one of the kitchen barstools, stared at Leonard in a manner intended to be unnerving.
"Look, Leonard, see?" Penny said. "How is that not Sheldon? He's glaring at you."
"But he's a cat," Leonard protested—rather uselessly, Sheldon thought, but Leonard was useless in most emergency situations. Very privately, Sheldon was willing to entertain the notion that he would be panicking himself if he hadn't drawn up a preparedness plan for everything from the Soup Garden closing unexpectedly to armadas of giant squid rising from the sea and conquering France. Sheldon growled in disapproval.
"Huh," Penny said. "That's the same sound he made after I shot his cushion with the paint gun." In the ultimate expression of disdain, Sheldon turned away from her and began to clean behind his ear with one paw. "And he's still self-cleaning, too!" Well. She didn't have to sound so delighted.
"He's a cat," Leonard repeated.

Later that afternoon, as Dean drove him home, Sam asked if the world were ending. Dean leered and replied that if Sam were Candace Sullivan, the earth shook that afternoon during Study Hall, but no, the world was not ending.
~ Sam reacted with a quick backwards elbow to his unseen opponent’s ribs, but was deflected by a large hand on his wrist and a sudden painful jerk to the side. Sam fell to his knees to alleviate the twist to his shoulder, glaring up at his grinning brother with a look that, if wishes were granted, would make Dean’s head explode.
~ Dean got the look on his face that said he was about to lie his ass off.
"You do!" Sam accused. "You write fanfiction?!"

"So basically, unless I want to watch Leonard ogle women he'll never talk to, Raj ogle women he can’t talk to, and Howard hit on women he shouldn't talk to… I'm pretty much stuck with you."
~ "So," Arthur said, and chose that moment to be too perceptive by half. "You're in love with me." Merlin scowled and pulled his hand away, "I am so not in love with you." "And," Arthur said, "apparently you're the stupidest sorcerer in all of Albion." Merlin let that one go. It was the truth, after all. Who in his right mind slaved for the people most likely to kill him by choice?

"Not very good in a normal person way or not very good in a Hermione way, which means still ten times better than everybody else?" He said it without thinking, and, for a moment, he was terrified that he'd said the worst thing possible.

“Well, the ATF…uh…suggested, strongly that I steer clear of their investigation. I believe the exact phrasing was ‘we have permission to shoot you on sight’.”
