“No it’s not,” Zoë said…well not frantically. Zoë did not do frantically. 
“It’s been three weeks since your last check-up. And quite recently you were bounced around.” Simon used his reasonable voice. The one that made you feel like a naughty five year old.
~ There were few things that Inara Serra and Jayne Cobb had in common. Two of these things were that one) they were both air breathing mammals and two) they were both terrified of spiders.
~
“Do you really think so low of me that I would break hundreds of years of silence just for my name in the spotlight and a little extra cash?”
Morgan simply blinked at me, “That’s precisely how low my opinion is of you.”
~
“What is the last thing you remember?”
“Um, mushrooms?”
~
“You know that fungus that sometimes grows underneath toenails?”
Romana wrinkled her nose. “Not personally, no.”
~
“Note to self,” she read. “The design and blueprints index, for the mark two screwdriver, is not in this drawer, but it might be on the top row, in one of the drawers to the left…” she squinted to make out the miniscule glyphs scrawled at the bottom of the page. “Or possibly in one of the spare tea caddies in the kitchen.”
“Ooh, tea,” the Doctor said, his face brightening. “I could murder a cup!”
~
“Or what? You’ll shatter my mind? Oh, wait, you were going to do that anyway. So, no.”
~
The Doctor’s face went still and cold. In Mal, Inara knew, that expression meant that someone was about to get shot. The Doctor didn’t have a gun, but she suspected that it still meant much the same thing. “I wouldn’t, if I were you.”
~
“But the motto says ‘serve and protect’, not ‘serve and protect unless it’s Reavers, in which case hide and cry like a little girl.’ No matter how tempting the idea might be.”
~
Relief rose off Twofalls like steam. “Really? I could kiss you.”
“Please don’t. I barely know you.”
~
Somehow, that didn’t bother him as much as he thought it should. On the other hand, he thought, it wasn’t the first time he’d died. 
~
“What I feel for you...you aren’t bound or beholden to me in any way. Whatever you decide to do, wherever you go in this life...it’s your decision. I’m not looking’ to tie you down. I don’t...own you. I–I can’t offer you what you deserve. I’ll never be able to do that. But, for whatever it’s worth and whatever you decide to do with it...my heart is yours, and always will be.” Then, looking like he couldn’t quite believe he’s said all of that out loud, he turned back to the game going on below. A red flush crept up his neck. She kept her face serene, out of habit more than anything, but inside it felt as though a star had lit up. This must be what joy is, she thought.
~
“We must guide the young Tauri on their future paths as warriors, O’Neill,” offered T’ealc as he carried two boxes of pamphlets on careers in astrophysics and Air Force recruitment.
~
“The correct sequence is chew, swallow, speak. And don’t make me say that again. I sound like my mother.”
~ “I remember how much I ate at fifteen,” Daniel said. “Besides, I figure that whatever Johnny doesn’t eat, Jack will finish for him.” This sentence caught Jack in the middle of helping himself to a slice of toast.
~
“You’ll never believe what happened.”
“Oh, that is the one statement out of your mouth that I’m willing to take on faith,” he said dryly, as he waved the guns down.
~ “Oh, and do try to avoid reading and driving at the same time, Sir. I know you can’t die, but I hate cleaning blood out of the upholstery.”
~
After a long moment of staring at him with this lost lonely look in his eyes that kind of makes Dean want to go out back and punch himself in the face, Sam shakes his head and returns to poking at his poached eggs like he’s going for a gold medal in breakfast-stabbing.
~
And Mandy told him that while she’d had lovely time, she just didn’t think she was ready to get back into another relationship so soon. Although the words she actually used were a lot less polite.
~ He tried a little bit of spell-casting again, some thaumaturgy, and when that all failed, he kicked the nearest wall, which neither helped nor made him feel better. When he returned home, frustrated and cold, Bob at least had the decency to not say ‘I told you so.’
~
“I prefer the term ‘living impaired,’ if you don’t mind.”
~
“The missing children. They’re connected.” Harry sighed. “I miss the days when a coincidence was just a coincidence.”
~ “Okay. The first thing you should remember is that I’m the messenger. Don’t panic,” said Andrew, his voice high and desperate.
“What happened?!”
“Don’t panic!” Andrew practically shouted. “No one’s allowed to panic. It’s a rule.”
~ “I can’t believe I agreed to this,” Ron said, drawing patterns in the dust on the desktop with the end of his quill. “I must have been mad. Oh, yes, let’s all go back to school! That’s the last time I make plans with you two when we’ve had half a bottle of Ogden’s.”
“I wasn’t drunk,” said Hermione primly.
~
“Murphy, key’s not working’.” Harry slurred. He gave it another try, stabbing at the door with the brass key.
“That’s because that’s your key. And this is my door,” Murphy informed patiently. “Now stop leaning on it so I can open it.”
~
Okay, now, what would Bruce do in- oh, who am I kidding? He’d never get in a situation like this! Too damn dignified, and the worst part is he doesn’t even try to be. Okay, so Bruce can’t help you here. What would Terry McGinnis do? Well, apparently he’d sit around like a furry little ball of stupidity and refer to himself in the third person instead of actually coming up with a plan.
~
“Mr. Simpson, my name is Dr. Burns; I’m your son and daughter’s new physics teacher.”
“I’m going to go out on a limb and guess, lying about their last name isn’t the only reason you’re here.” 
~
“There may have been intermittent gossip,” she admitted. “Gossip just happens to be an integral part of studying.” “And which part would that be?” “The staying awake part,” she said, rolling her eyes.
~
Taking his arm, she asked with a bright smile, ‘Are there any other tales of grisly and untimely deaths?’
‘Naturally,’ he said, perfectly serene. ‘Sir Robert was executed in the courtyard, that was during Cromwell’s time…Lady Margaret hung herself in the long gallery…and there is always Aunt Helen, she was guillotined…’
~
Daniel aimed for body language somewhere between non-confrontational and politely curious as he turned around.
~ He’d be damn glad when they found the rogue agents so he could shoot them and go home.
~ Greer was eyeing Daniel like he couldn’t decide whether to skin him alive or just stab him in the heart. Which really was an odd look to be able to recognize, if Daniel thought about it.
~
He wondered if Jack would get mad if he just shot everybody.
~
“Son-of-a bitch!” he said without imagination as he gingerly examined his arm for damage.
~ O’Neill grimaced, “I always thought it was more search than rescue, but maybe that’s just me.”
~
“The blond has tits, Captain.”
Keats shot O’Conner a disgusted look, “Thank-you for pointing that out, Sergeant. I’m sure the rest of us missed that fact.”
~ “Think if I got on your shoulders I could reach the top and climb out?” he speculates, trying to eyeball the depth of the pit they were in.
“Considering you’ve got a broken arm—”
“Fractured at best,” Owen interrupts.
“And I can’t stand up,” Ianto continues over him, gesturing vaguely to the deep gash on his right leg. “I don’t think you have much of a chance,” he finishes from his place on the ground, effectively murdering Owen’s optimism. 
~ “You really need to get out more,” says Owen, matching dry for dry.
“Yes, because this outing has been so encouraging.”
~
“No painkillers for you. Even if I had any, none for you. You got a bad knock in the head—”
“That’s from you falling on me, Owen,” Ianto can’t help pointing out.
“And you probably have a concussion,” the physician concludes.
He gives her a slightly disbelieving glare. “You’re one to talk. You’ve been holding an entire conversation with the tree root by my head.”
~ It sounds like her. Underwater, maybe. He explains as least pathetically as possible that he’s stuck down a hole in the middle of the woods.
~ “I’ve got a busted arm—”
“And a concussion,” Ianto supplies next to him.
“And teaboy’s getting gangrene as we speak. Oi! You die and I get your iPod.” He gets double the earful of Welsh from both sides. All of which he can’t understand and guesses it’s probably better if he doesn’t.
~
The next day, he persistently argues with the doctor on call to be released until he makes himself irritating enough so that the doctor could care less if she drops dead.
~ “Uh, Jack?” Daniel said finally, as officers flew in all directions. “I think we’re going to need chocolate.” Jack didn’t argue. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out his wallet and located a ten dollar bill. Daniel fingered it thoughtfully, then flinched as a booming explosion rocked the atmosphere, the vibrations strong enough that Daniel could feel it through the rock under his feet. Teal’c handed over a twenty.
~ Dunst grinned. “Five bucks says she decks him within the next twenty-four hours.”
Carson raised a curious eyebrow. “He always this devoid of survival instincts?”
“Yes,” Michael said glumly.
~
“Bet his mother was a Marine,” Dunst mumbled as Michael nodded. “An evil Gunnery Sergeant of a Marine.”
~ “If we move swiftly, I believe we will be able to hide the body with a minimum of effort, Alexandra.”
~ They shook hands. “Yeah. I’m sorry for the, ah…”
“Kidnapping?”
Jackson winced. “Abrupt relocation? We’re not really sure what to do about you,” the man spoke wryly.
~
“In the past two hours I’ve been politely threatened by four Marines, two Tech Sergeants, half a dozen scientists and someone named Murray. I’ll tell you what I told them. I limit my mid-life crises to fast cars, end quote.”
~
“I hope all these friends you’re visiting are female,” he admonishes, and she can practically hear the accusatory finger he’s pointing. “Straight females,” he adds, as an afterthought, and she hears the distinctive thwump that indicates a good-natured whack from Rose.
~ “Oh a bug squashing joke!” Spider-man said. “Wow! I’ve never heard one of those every time I’ve fought a super-villain.”
~ “I sprayed you with a highly volatile mixture of capsaicin and lachrymator, which are the active ingredients in pepper spray and mace respectively, I also threw in cayenne pepper and trace amounts of rattlesnake venom. The stuff will take out a Tyrannosaurus. So while you’re down there wishing your eyes weren’t on fire I just want to point out that I gave you a chance to stand down first.”
~
A gout of flame actual fire, burst from his palm and impacted—something. She really only registered “huge,” “green,” and “teeth” in the few seconds the fire lasted.
~ The first thing to greet Tosh when she opens her eyes is the sight of a dishevelled Ianto. So obviously she jumps to the conclusion that they have about five minutes to avert impending doom. As a woman of science, Tosh doesn’t put too much trust in signs and portents. But she does put stock in the idea that the universe fundamentally operates on patterns. The last time Ianto’s clothes were this dirty, they’d all nearly been eaten by cannibals. And there was the time before that when he’d ruined his suit and a Cyberman almost deleted them.
~
She means to ask the appropriate questions like, “What’s going on?” “What’s trying to kill us?” and “How many are there?” But she can only groan pitifully and clutch at her throbbing head.
~
“Owen, you throw up and I’m going to leave you to drown in it.”
“Then you’d have to clean up the vomit and a dead body, Teaboy. Let’s see how you like that.” 
~
“Ooo Lego!” exclaims the brown haired man. “I love Lego.” He throws himself unselfconsciously onto the rug beside James who takes it completely in his stride and offers him a blue piece without comment.
~ 
“Superman seems to like everyone, except for bank robbers and muggers and miscreants of that ilk.”
~
Dean Winchester, mighty demon-hunter, jolts awake and promptly rolls off the bed.
~ “I’m good, but I’m not a doctor. I try to sew that up, and you’re going to look like Frankenstein the rest of your life.”
~
But Sam’s cheer was contagious as well as obnoxious, and the put-upon sigh Dean heaved as he pushed himself upright was pure show.
~
“Dude, you do know you’re not the only one who knows how to use a computer, right?”
“But I password-pro—”
“Eighteen years, Sammy.”
“You are never figuring out the next—”
Dean was watching TV again, and interrupted almost idly. “Liquorice.” Sam gaped at him.
~
Sam also prided himself on having learned the full range of Dean Winchester grimaces, from the “oh, geez, a rat,” to “okay, that hurt,” to “yeah, I can’t breathe, but no rush to the hospital, bro.”
~
Also, my love for George cannot be expressed in anything other than interpretive dance. The kind of interpretive dance done by hyperactive Muppets on sugar, caffeine and crack.
~
“If it is a nunyenunc, the Shoshoni used to kill them with poisoned arrows.”
The answer was slow but all Dean. “Gee, I must’ve left those in my other jacket.”
~
“Dude, cops often have the worst security. They figure nobody’s going to be stupid enough to rob them,” Dean crowed.
“Yeah, ‘cause they’ve never met you,” Sam said dryly.
~
“Last time we camped it was because you almost drowned.”
Not to be outdone, “Time before that, you nearly got eaten.”
There was a long silence, the Impala chewing up the asphalt under them. Dean finally shrugged. “Yeah, okay, let’s go camping.”
~
“Don’t go too far, you might get lost!” Gabriel made a sound that might be a snort before walking deliberately further away. 
~
“So, what are you going to tell them?”
“The least ridiculous lie I can come up with in the next five minutes.”
~
“You remember the wood nymph that took you when you were six?” he finally asked.
Sam straightened a little. “No—wait. I was…up in a tree? I thought I’d dreamed that,” Sam said, voice wondering.
Dean huffed a laugh, slid down a little. “I’m not surprised—you were pretty freaked out.”
“Yeah, well, you try being held hostage in a tree,” Sam defended heatlessly.
~
He had a map in one hand and one of those “where the fuck am I?” expressions on his face. It evolved to an awkward “I hope you know where the fuck I am” smile as he said, “Uh, hi. You don’t happen to live around here by chance, do you?”
~
As answers go, that was his second choice. His first was “whatever, asshole,” but that seemed more like an I-have-the-flashlight-and-you’re-at-the-bottom-of-the-well kind of answer, so he stashed it away for future reference, just in case that ever came up.
~
He was really going to have to stop letting his kid watch bad horror movies. And maybe quit hanging around other kids, too; because God knows kids were experts at being mean for no better reason than just being mean. Kind of like bosses … and IRS auditors.
~
Randy forgot his question to give them both another short course on all the words his son was not allowed to say. Ever. No matter what.
~ It wasn’t the most articulate warning as warnings go, but evidently John spoke scared shitless well enough to interpret his tone to a reasonably accurate meaning. He reached out, grabbed Adam by the back of the neck and shoved him to the ground as he turned, drew a gun from only God knows where and started shooting.
~
“You’re Sam and Dean Winchester?”
“Are Sam and Dean Winchester in trouble?” Dean asked.
“They might be.”
Dean shook his head. “I’m sorry, sir. Our twins moved out about two days ago. I think they’re staying down at the shelter and -.”
Sam rolled his eyes and interrupted. “Do you want coffee?”
“Yes, please.” Dean was still rambling about Sam and Dean being real trouble and how they gave a whole knew meaning to evil twins
~ I feel kind of silly having offered in the first place, but it’s hard to feel much past that because so much of my brain is occupied with wanting desperately to lean down and kiss her. It could be a scientific kiss, just to see if it really was a dream. I could compare.
~ Doyle grinned. “I’d rather not say what everybody calls me…especially my dad. ‘Doyle’ or ‘Mike’ are plenty good enough, I guess.”
~ Tra: Oh, that one guy…in that one movie…with the big rock…
Me: Indiana Jones?
~
Susan: “Are you disappointed in me?” Leland: “No. I set very low expectations.”
~
“K-H-E-L-L-E…you spelled ‘Hello’ wrong.”
~
The briefcase clicks open, and he pulls out files stuffed full of papers, Post-It notes, and photographs. “Do you know what this is?” “Wilful destruction of the rainforest?”
~
Your friend, Ashley,” Sam went on. Maggie’s face twitched for a moment before she pulled it under control again. Victor suspected that Maggie and Ashley maintained the kind of friendship that he had seen among many former sorority members, which meant that they didn’t claw each other’s eyes out at the reunions and that was about it.
~
“I have a very high metabolism.” “They used to call that a tapeworm,” Dick muttered, and Victor barked a sharp little laugh.
~ “This is my car,” she said. “I spend a great deal of time in my car, due to the nature of my business. I simply cannot have you taking up space and--” and smelling the place up, was what she wanted to add, but it sounded so undignified and in fact the ghost, being a ghost, did not smell at all. Although he looked like he ought to. “--and interfering in my affairs!”
~
“I had a boyfriend who used to walk into rooms like that. ‘The Grand Entrance.’ It got kind of boring. Though he was one of twins, so I put up with it. Twin acrobats. Man. I got to write that book. Maybe even illustrate it.”
~
Getting To Know Each Other, in all capital letters, he could tell by the way they said it, was an inescapable part of the college experience.
~
It was too easy, but Dean opened his mouth anyway. Sam cut him off impatiently. “No, not syphilis. Sisyphus.”
~
“Umm, yeah… You know how I’ve been getting better with the telepathy for a while now?” It takes a minute, but Dean gets it. 
“You cheated at cards with death?” He’s aware he sounds a little hysterical, but doesn’t care enough to stop. “Are you out of your mind?”
Sam’s looking at him with the unique blend of pout and glare he’d mastered at thirteen. “What was he going to do, kill me?”
Dean’s hitting the incandescent mark. “Yeah, moron. It’s kind of in his job description, you know.”
~ “I’m in labour, I’m not incapacitated. Give me my damn keys.”
~ That meant Logan had to go to either House or a foster home, and House figured the kid would probably go on a killing spree if he was chucked into the foster-care system, and then House would probably get annoying reporters coming to his door to get the family’s perspective for their tabloids.
~ “It’s called earning your keep. It can be found in the dictionary right next to building character and moral improvement. Look it up.”
~
“You turn off the gravity?” he asks.  “No, you just drank your weight in moonshine.” Mal smiles, and up close, his eyes are blue and bright.
~
“April showers bring May flowers, dude.” “This is an April blizzard.” “So it brings really fucking tough May flowers. May flowers with teeth.” Dean paused, then added thoughtfully, “And blowtorches.”
~ Teal’c was saying things like, “Yes, indeed, I am sure all will be well,” and “we will exact an appropriate vengeance upon the Ori for this” and “I will consider it a pleasure to crack open their skulls and eat their brains.”
~
“Great. Keep up the good work. When you do you think you’ll be--” It was probably a little sad that he had a standardized vague hand gesture that meant “back to normal.” After a while, Jack turned to Daniel and said, “Maybe it’d be faster if you could, you know--” Sadly, he had a standardized hand gesture for this, too. “And then come straight back down. What? It’s worked before.”
~
“I wonder if human brains are tastier and, uh, better-textured?” At that point everyone started to look speculatively at Jack’s forehead again, so he said his farewells and wished them luck.
~ “Ah, trees,” Jack said, mostly to himself. “How I have missed the alien trees.”
“I’m sure they’ve missed you too, sir,” Mitchell deadpanned
~ “Those are…fangs, aren’t they?” Daniel asked in a tone of mild inquiry. “I knew the fact that your Tau’ri field kits don’t include stakes was an oversight,” she proclaimed.
~
“Cracked rib.” Sam ticked the items off on his fingers. “Swollen knee. Bruised shoulder.” He stood up and held out his hands for the keys.
~
He shrugged. “If they don’t want their secret affairs becoming school hall gossip, they shouldn’t be assholes to psychics. I’m just saying.”
~ “That’s my dying wish,” Sam’s sepulchral voice continued. “That Dad knows that everything that ever happened in our entire lives, starting with that thing with the bubble gum and the bathroom door when I was five, right up until today, it’s all your fault.”
~ “You don’t even know what the word ‘soliloquy’ means.” “It means you’re bitching but nobody cares.”
~
“Third rule: when you see that the woman you’re talking to has a tattoo that says ‘Property of J the Man’, you stop flirting immediately. Rule four,” he said, waiting until Sam looked up, “when you’re in a bar called the Texas Longhorn Roadhouse Saloon and you’re the only dude in the place without a Stetson and a silver belt buckle, it’s probably best if you try real hard not to make fun of country music.”
~
“I was watching you,” he repeated, giving a low whistle, “and, man, you never glanced at the screen once. You knew all the words.” Sam was looking down again, but his lips twitched, like maybe he was trying not to smile. Or trying not to vomit. It was hard to tell. “All the words,” Dean said, shaking his head in awe. “Look, man, I don’t want to know the details, ‘cause I’ve heard the rumours about those pasty-faced drama club kids you hang out with and maybe it’s none of my business, but you’ve got to tell me: where the hell did you learn all the words to ‘I Will Survive’ good enough to belt it our without missing a beat while three sheets to the wind?”
~
“Psych minor, philosophy major - very ying and yang; but does the Princeton degree say that? I said ‘put in ying and yang’ and they’re like, nope, summa cum laude…whatever.”
~ “Rattlesnake,” stated Sam in an anxious voice.
“You sure?”
“No!” blurted Dean sharply, “it was a legless lizard with a pair of fuckin’ maracas tied to its ass! Yes, he’s sure! 
~
“Dean’s Guide to Credit Card Fraud—extra credit for... extra credit. Ba dum bum.”
~
“Hey, I know the drill: you start hurling in the Impala, you get jettisoned out the front door. Believe me, I’ve got the scars to prove it.” 
“The car was not moving, Sam.” Sam looked up, working that doe-eyed sincerity for all he was worth. 
“I had asphalt burns over, like, 90 percent of my body!” Dean sputtered at the audacity. 
“You are such a liar! You had a scrape on your hand from the seatbelt! And if you weren’t such a load, you wouldn’t have even had that!” “Revisionist,” Sam said dismissively “Deludedanalist,” Dean shot back, ducking the pillow a laughing Sam tossed at him.
~ “Unfortunately,” Jack finished, “their way of trying to settle is to crash-land on a planet and try to kill all the inhabitants.” “It’s a precautionary measure,” said The Doctor. “In case the natives are hostile.” Dean fired and another one went down; The Doctor cocked an eyebrow. “Which usually, they are,” The Doctor added.
~ “If you want my advice…when you tell the story in prison, say like….seven guys jumped you. Make it seem like you went down fighting instead of like a glass jawed pansy.”
~
“The goddess of destiny and fate. Shai’s partner, counterpart, or wife, depending on who you’re reading.” Dean had to hand it to him--not many people could sound like an encyclopaedia while whispering. Dean risked a look back at the two gods, who had thankfully completely forgotten there were other people in the room and were shouting at each other. Meskhenet tended to punctuate a lot of her angrier sentences with bursts of flame, he noticed. “I vote wife.”
~ There were a few common translations Dean had picked up over the years. ‘Widower’ usually meant ‘wife-killer’. ‘Noisy pipes’ usually meant ‘ghost.’ And ‘women’s reading circle’ always meant ‘coven’.
~
“Do you want us to secure his cooperation, sir?” one asked; a euphemism for beating the man half to death prior to questioning.
~
“It ever occur to you that there are people who go their whole lives without having to spend their last dime on ransom money? People who never have to think ‘Hey, you know, I wonder if that sadistic bastard I crossed last month is out to break my fingers one at a time’? I could be one of those people. Sometimes I think I might like very much to be one of those people.”
~ If she hadn’t insisted that he stop and pick up more Diet Coke on his way, he would have never stopped at the quiet mom and pop grocery store. He would have never caught the attention of the wacko in the parking lot and the aforementioned nut job would never have been able to stick him with the tranquilizers. Yup, from now on Carter would have to stick to beer or water. Diet Coke was obviously the work of the devil.
~ His left hand encountered another unexpected bump in his jacket pocket. No, they can’t be this dumb. Jack calmly reached in and pulled out his cell phone. Okay, maybe they are this stupid. Have I been kidnapped by morons?  Jack waited until both the bodyguards had carefully tossed their pistols out of reach then hit speed dial for the SGC by feel. “Walter, it me. I need two teams to secure my location stat. The Odyssey can provide transportation. I have one dead hostile and three hostiles under my control with an unknown number in the area and at least one other hostage. And Walter, don’t you dare tell my wife. O’Neill out.” Jack snapped the phone shut and smirked as Carbone jumped at the sound “Now, Mr. Carbone,” Jack started coolly with his pistol still firmly pointed at the guy. “As nice as this distraction is, I am on VACATION. I have never heard of you, your organization, this Murdock character, the ‘save the swamplands’ gig, or this MacGyver guy. Though frankly, I think I just did him a favour by putting that psychopath over there out of his misery...I don’t have a son...I do have a beautiful wife that I haven’t seen in over two months. And this little diversion of yours has delayed our reunion by several hours. So, PLEASE, give me one reason why I shouldn’t kill you right now?”
~
“Light bulbs die, my dear. I am departing.”
~ You didn’t think I’d write, did you? Just wanted to let you know that I signed up for Art History with Prof. Blocker for the upcoming quarter. Oh, hey, aren’t you in that class? Wow, what a coincidence. Huh. I have no idea how that happened. Oh well. I guess you’re just going to have to crane your neck to see around me for another ten weeks. Hard luck for you. ~Sam
You get asked why you’re grinning for hours afterwards. By January, the folder you’ve labelled Sam has over a hundred messages in it.
~ Sammy kicks him – again – and bites his hand hard enough to draw blood. The left one this time. At least he has a sense of symmetry.
~
Dean is loyal, protective, supportive, and courageous, but his personality does not begin and end with those traits. He is not a dog. Witness the lack of furry ears and the presence of opposable thumbs.
~ “It’s. Not. True.” Each word precisely spoken, like a nail being driven home.
~ She raises an eyebrow that couldn’t be more of a ‘bitch, please’ if she wrote it in three-foot letters of fire.
~
‘Mandibles’? Who the hell used a word like ‘mandibles’ when they’d just been all but beheaded by a freaking monster spider creature?
~
“That was a manly bellow,” Dean muttered. Even he could hear the lack of conviction in his tone
~ “The creepy little guy called her his Dark Lady.” “Yeah well, the creepy little guy was batshit insane, in case you hadn’t noticed.”
~
His freckles and big green eyes made his father’s stoic soldier routine impossible to replicate. Wisely, the boy didn’t even try. He just slouched insolently in his chair and went straight for bored tough guy, the perennial favourite of teenage boys everywhere.
~ A pair of earrings and a matching pendant lay nestled in white velvet, made from silver so delicately worked that it looked less like jewelry than like the gleam of jewelry, made briefly solid.
~
“I feel like I’m living a Cosmopolitan quiz. ‘You find yourself trapped in a elevator with a billionaire bachelor. Do you a) Make out for the entertainment of the security camera b) Discuss his company’s new super secret defence contract which they somehow stole from your boss c) Put him at ease by pretending you’re engaged to a Dallas Cowboys linebacker?’”
“A?” Bruce asked hopefully.
~ Address: As ‘sir’ unless you buy me a drink. Gender: Is a social, culturally-defined term for psychological, not physical, characteristics, and therefore none of your business. Yearly Income: Haven’t the slightest. Guild Status: Guild was destroyed. Long, tragic story. Rating: Can be rather insulting and discriminatory, so I never do it. Description of Typical Act: Depends on the audience. Spectacles mastered: Transformation. Transmutation. Illusion. Transportation. Divination. Disassembly. Mother’s Maiden Name: Mother was never a maiden. Other long story.
~
“Always liked the ring trick, I did. You want something flashier, don’t you? That’s your problem. No appreciation of subtlety-- just want it big and flashy. Philistines. Fine. Have it your way. For my next trick, I will make a member of the audience disappear!” A faint murmur of approval went through the crowd. “Complete and utter uncultured twats. I’ll have you know this is a dangerous little trick, here. People have gone mad. Or disappeared completely.” “Why don’t you disappear completely?” someone yelled. “Catty little bipeds, all of you. Chrissa! Bring out the box for the uncultured swine!” “I don’t think you should insult the audience.” “They bloody well started it!”
~
“Silence, you silly little humans. I’m serious here. This is a door into a realm no mere mortal should enter. But because you gits are easily bored, I will put this man’s sanity in jeopardy.”
~
“Then we infiltrate the facility. There may be explosions at some point. Depends on circumstances and security.”
~
“Hello! I’m here to destoy this facility. Thought I’d warn you so you could update your resumes, or whatever it is you have on this planet. Though if I were you, I really would’ve gotten on that as soon as I’d heard the blaster fire.”
~
He just beamed at them. “If I told you, then it wouldn’t be a secret plan, now would it?”
~
“Really long story. For now, we’ll call it a miracle. We’re breaking this place open and letting everything out. Want to lend a hand?” “Are you kidding?!” He laughed and spun her around. “Yes! Where’s the dynamite?”
~
“I don’t know how. I don’t know if it can be reversed. But it’ll be okay. I promise you, no matter who I have to kill, it’ll be okay.”
~
“Remember what I said about this planet being perfectly harmless? Turns out I was wrong. Happens every so often.”
~
“They had to use viruses to alter their subjects’ DNA. They picked a retroviral that their planet’s population by-and-large couldn’t fight. You’re not from their planet. Your system could detect it, and do a fairly good job of rooting it out. And your systems are similar enough that I can isolate your antibodies and vaccinate them.” “...Most of that was English, right?”
~
“Found a couple confederates. Infiltrated the system as a magician. Blew up a few things. I’ll be happy to tell you the whole story when you’re coherent.”
~ Morry wasn’t being followed by anybody. He sometimes felt a little resentful about that, but tried to remember that being followed by nobody was a hell of a lot better than being followed by an assassin.
~
“Do you drive a black Lexus? Because I owe you a tail light and a rear bumper.”
~
“What is the division between the work? Well, Matt will do the work, I will take the credit.”
~
“That’s his phone number? I just thought it was his uniform number. You know, they sign their name, and then write the number…”
“Yeah, they do… do that. You thought his uniform number was 3 billion, 106 million, 786 thousand, 5? Hun— he was asking you out.”
~ “I’m gonna show them around the studio, and when we say goodnight, I swear to God, my father’s gonna ask me if I need any money, and it is going to take everything I’ve got not to point out to him I could buy his house four times and turn it into my ping-pong room.”
~ ““Ye” is a word you don’t hear a lot.”
~ “We have a press department, I get a daily packet. They highlight what they want me to see. This one got a highlight, an arrow and a sticker!”
~ “Well, your side hates my side because you think we think you’re stupid, and my side hates your side because we think you’re stupid.”
~
“I want to commission a scientific study of how news travels in this building!”
“Hey, I’m not even sure there’s such a thing as the Internet. It might just be Jeannie telling everyone stuff.”
~ “All Christmas trees are dead, they’ve been cut down.”
~
“See, Lucy, I’m a bit of an astronomy buff.”
“Loser. The word is “loser”.”
~ “The last time we had a wrap party in the studio we had to shut down for two weeks while we rebuilt the studio.”
~
“I’m afraid you got that concussion from me; I pushed you down to shield you from the blast, but I bumped your head straight into the floor. I’m ever so sorry.”
~
“Death has... in the past twenty minutes... gained a staggering appeal.”
~ “How does it mean you win? I’m escaping you!” “Ah, but I endured an entire year of your company. If you cop out now, it means you’re a nancy-boy and I therefore win.”
~ Why is it always this sort of coincidence he runs into? Why doesn’t he ever run into the “Oh look, exactly the part I needed to fix the TARDIS!” sort of coincidence?...That is, why does he only run into that sort of coincidence after the “Oh dear, thousands of small furry creatures have mistaken me for the devil and broken my TARDIS!” sort of coincidence? It seems a bit unfair.
~ “Ah, ‘blew up’, did it?” “Happened to combust whilst I was in the vicinity. Point is, I was afraid I might’ve slipped though a time window.”
~
“If you weren’t, as you’ve just explained, emptying vats of chemicals into my veins, I’d probably be able to answer. But at the moment, I simply don’t remember. I do apologise if you’re disappointed.”
~ A sword at the green man’s throat. “I don’t know if you’ve got a juglar vein,” said Rumiko, “but I figure there’s gotta be something in there you don’t wanna see severed. Drop. The. Gun.”
~ “Oh, look! A self-destruct button. Thank you so much for saving us the trouble!”
“Hah. You will never manage to penetrate the subtle workings of our—” The Doctor took out a strange metal rod and pointed it at the control device. “Self-destruct in two rh’shim,” said a voice. “You were saying?” said the Doctor, with a wide grin.
~ “Speaking of which...” The Doctor turned. Right on cue, there was a faint explosion.
~
“Can’t destroy them, can’t hurt them, can’t expose them. All I could think of to do was screw them out of money.” “After egging your supervisor’s house and shagging his wife.” “Wives. And husband.” Jack grinned. Rose stared at him for a moment, smile slowly spreading across her face. “...Your century is weird.”
~ Mickey shuddered. “D’you have any idea what ‘tea’ was prison slang for?!” “No, and I would be eternally grateful if you didn’t tell me. Come on, now. We’ll get you a nice, non-communal shower and some clean clothes and some tea and some chocolate.”
~ “Yes, you’ve mentioned that,” the President said, irritably. “Would you mind going outside and making an actual appointment with—?” “Yes, actually, I would. Because when I said ‘the Daleks must be destroyed’, I meant the Daleks must be destroyed now. I do apologize; I should’ve made that clearer. Could we get on with the destroying, then?”
~ “Watch where you put your hands, young man, before I have to demand a betrothal!”
~
“How is it that no one’s ever hit you in the head with a potato?”
“I duck and weave, baby.”
~
“In training I was awake and alone for three straight nights, trying to avoid capture.”
“How’d you do?”
“I was awake when they captured me.”
~
“Dealing with the press isn’t easy.”
“I wouldn’t know. I’ve spent most of my adult life dealing with people who want to kill me.”
“It’s roughly the same principle.”
~
“How do you walk into a hospital and then get sicker?”
“She’s in a building full of people with diseases…go figure.”
~
“They wrote and recorded a Treason Jingle?”
~
“Look, you don’t understand. Matt writes the show, I produce it and Wes sits in his office dying of old age and taking the credit.”
~
“You can’t make a decision this important in the ten minute walk back from the office.”
“You’re right. I didn’t need the full ten minutes.”
~
“Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.”
~
“You found him, brought it up, carefully considered, then decided I can go stuff it?”
“He agreed with my analysis that death plays poorly at Christmas.”
“Did you even take it to him? Or just walk around the block and come back with your ‘no’?”
~
“3.2 billion men in the world. She picks him.”
“I hear he had a great pitching arm.”
“When he was 19, sure. She dumped a Rhodes scholar for this guy. Zoey left Charlie for the Frog. Ellie and the guitar player with the purple van. My children choose morons. Every one.” 
“They say daughters look for their fathers.”
~ Somewhere in middle of hour 54 Sam asks if Dean, at least, is proud of him, and Dean says yeah, but you’re still a little shit. Which, from Dean, is three parts I love you, two parts I’ll miss you, and one part no click-flick moments, Sammy. So Sam pretends to defend himself and the fight quickly deteriorates into a competitive championship of all the stupid car games they used to play when they were little, from In My Grandmother’s Trunk to 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.
~ He never tells Sam, but Dean spends an extra three days in Palo Alto, clearing every single closet of its skeletons, making sure there is nothing supernatural lurking around. He kills three ghosts, two poltergeists, and exercises a demon. When he’s satisfied, he carves the strongest protection charms he can find onto four separate plates and buries them on each side of Sammy’s dorm.
~
“Hey, Matthew,” he greeted his kidnapper with genuine warmth in his voice and Matthew decided that yes, travel between worlds had obviously driven the Redeemer completely insane.
~
Dean glared at his overly happy brother. “That euphoria thing still hasn’t worn off, has it?”
Sam beamed. “Nope!” His brother’s door opened. “Let’s go!”
~ “Damn!” The mirror shattered in its frame, splitting into three large fragments.
“Cool,” Sam said from behind him with awe. “Dean can actually damn things.”
~
He smiled lazily. He was feeling no pain anywhere any more, didn’t even mind the injection in his right bicep, which was something because he hated needles. Oh, but he had struggled and cursed like a madman before the drugs took effect.
~ Despite the warm glow from the drugs, he didn’t like this place. “You guys like to hit too much.” His eyes became distant, and he began to nod off. He jerked his head back up, blinking slowly. “Good drugs, though...”
~ Talking head number two frowned. “That can’t really be your name.”
“It’s not! I lied!” Dean announced brightly. He swayed a little in the chair. “I do that a lot. It’s my job,” he added solemnly, then scowled. “But I don’t have a job,” he said slowly, bewildered, to no one in particular.
~
He observed traffic laws and speed laws until they hit the back highways, and then he drove like a bat out of hell.
~ His eyes focused and unfocused several times, until he finally got it right. He grinned at him. “So, what’cha doing down here on the floor?”
“I dunno,” Sam replied hazily. “Thought I’d…check out…the tile. S’interestin.’”
~ “Will you give me a fucking break? Stop raining on me, damn it!” And it did. Just like that. It went in reverse, the clouds folding in on themselves, the wind slipping away thru the trees. He could almost see the rain fall upwards, back into the sky. Dean sat there, staring upwards. Then he grinned. A little. He made it rain several times, just to be sure. Dean made it rain, and then he made it stop.
~ Her eyes glowed a deep, hellish yellow, the color of a poisoned sunrise.
~ Dean looked at him like he was insane. “Dude, I was four. Get over it.”
~ It looked as though God himself had reached down, put one hand on the front bumper, one hand on the rear bumper, and crumpled it like an angry kid in kindergarten mangling a piece of cardboard. All four tires were flat. Broken auto glass was everywhere.
~ She shook herself rather vigorously, from head to tail, and the blood flew off her like she was shaking off raindrops. The amulets and charms on her collar made a clear, bell-like sound. The blood disappeared in mid-air, and as Coyote watched the dents in her head filled in, closed up and her dull, pain-racked eyes became bright and healthy. The dog sat down, cocked her head to one side, pricked those large ears as she looked up at him as if to say, Yeah, okay, now what the hell are you staring at? She lifted her hind leg to scratch behind her right ear, and then yawned like everything bored the hell out of her.
~ Dean winked at him. “Gettin’ a little rusty, aren’t ya, kiddo? You bring shame upon our dojo, grasshopper,” he added with mock sorrow.
~ Bobby had a habit of naming his dogs after various government officials. Sam couldn’t tell if it was for ridicule or as a tribute, and he’d never asked Bobby why.
~ Dean blinks slowly. “Am I dead?”
“Nope, not yet.”
“Oh.” He raises an eyebrow at Blake. “But you’re dead.”
“As a doornail.” Blake agrees, nodding. “Excessive consumption of lead will do that for ya.”
~ “I said leave. No sense in both of us getting snatched.”
“Would you have left me?”
“Don’t change the subject. We’re not talking about me, we’re talking about you.” Dean snaps, which translates to “Hell, no!” and Sam knows it, too. 
~ Sam doesn’t remember Bobby dying too. Sam’s also surprised that they allow so much cussing up in heaven. Bobby’s in rare form. He starts out with “bastards” and progresses to “idjits.” Kubrick yells out “Don’t shoot”, and they go on from there. 
~ Wrong again as usual, dear, Bela thinks dryly. The inflection she gives the word dear sounds a lot like bitch.
~ Having wings should feel strange and weird. It doesn’t. He should be bothered by not being bothered by it. He isn’t.
~ Sam only ever got turned into an item of furniture once. In the middle of January, he spent four days as a floor lamp. Dean kept trying to put “mood lighting” light bulbs in, and Sam kept popping them.
~ “M,kay,” said the troll. “And I live under a bridge?” 
“Well, not so much an actual physical bridge as a metaphorical construct of a bridge.”
~ The pause is even longer and Dean starts to think they’ve got cut off by the time Dad speaks again. “Your car got my truck pregnant.” Okay. “My truck just gave birth to a litter,” Dad says. Right. Dad’s hallucinating.
“I know, we need to keep separate.” Don’t argue with the hallucination. “But shouldn’t my car get to see its kids?”
~ Dean has trouble saying it. “Dad thinks his truck’s given birth. And my car’s the dad.”
Give Sam credit, he only gapes for a few moments before he starts thinking about it. “So he’s been hit by something that causes hallucinations. Did he say what he was hunting?” “He was kind of distracted by the baby trucks.”
~
“‘K, bye now. Have a pleasant evening.” She slammed the phone closed triumphantly. “Finally! Have a pleasant evening talking on the phone with anyone other than me!”
~
“It’s like two time zones at war in the heart of the TARDIS! That’s a paradox. Could blow a hole in the space-time continuum the size of—well, actually, the exact size of Belgium. That’s a bit undramatic, isn’t it? Belgium?”
~ I shall be taking you to Old London town in the country of YooKay, ruled over by Good King Wenceslas. Now human beings worship the great god Santa, a creature with fearsome claws and his wife Mary. And every Christmas Eve, the people of YooKay go to war with the country of Turkey. They then eat the Turkey people for Christmas dinner, like savages.
~ Jo leaned over and plucked the empty bottles off the table. “Been seeing horses? I probably shouldn’t let you have any more of these!” Paul twisted round to grin up at her. “If a man’s hallucinating horses, I think he deserves a beer to get over the shock.”
~ Tad was a pretty good boyfriend. Way better than Tim, which wasn’t difficult, because a bar of chocolate was a better boyfriend than Tim.
~ The stairs were on her right. Or, well, the remains of the stairs. Still, Tad had managed to get up there, so she probably could, too. “Tad? Thump twice if you’re in danger!” Thump. Thump-crash. Oh, great. “And twice again if it’s a ghost.” Thud-wallop. Scrape-bang. Well, he might have just got his foot trapped in rotting floorboards or something. If, y’know, Kat’s life had been normal.
~
Kat narrowed her eyes. “What colour dress did I wear to the spring formal?” “I don’t know!” Ok, not her boyfriend. Kat swung the shotgun up. “But - your bra! Your bra was blue and it had little pink flowers on it!” Yeah. Maybe Tad wasn’t actually a great improvement on Gavin.
~ Ruby reminds herself that killing him would a) invalidate all her hard work over the last year and get them right back to where they started and b) never work out as Sam is the Anti-Christ and no one’s managed to kill him – permanently - yet.
~ “There’s evidence of...non-consensual sexual abuse of yaks,” Sam said, looking distinctly uncomfortable. “Yakfuckers,” Dean said. “Say it, Sam.” “We should stake the place out,” Sam said. “People who fuck yaks are yakfuckers, Sam,” Dean said. “If you don’t say ‘yakfuckers’, I’m out of here. There are a lot of other things I could be doing besides staking out yakfuckers.”
~ “Listen up, kid,” began Dean authoritatively, “rule number one—” The boy toppled over, snuggling into the seat.”—yeah, okay, we’ll finish this conversation when you wake up.”
~ “From now on,” he told the kid pointedly, ducking his head inside, “your name is ‘Scrawny-assed, self-absorbed, Mephistophelian little prick I’m thinking of selling on Ebay.’” Dean grinned, rolled down the windows, stepped on the gas, and added, “Danny, for short.”
~ “Shh, baby,” he murmured plaintively. “If this nice lady takes Daddy to jail, crazy uncle Eke will take care of you, so don’t worry, okay?”
~ “That’s it,” mumbled Dean, rummaging for his phone. “We’ll drop him off with Missouri.” Sam’s phone went off. “Boy, you better tell your brother to not even think about it, you understand?”
~ “You’ve put him away for life. In less than ten minutes. Pretty sure that breaks my record.” Under his breath, he adds, “And several laws.”
~ Mohinder knows his apartment well. So, when he unlocks the door and sees an extra pair of shoes by the rug, an extra coat on the rack, and an extra plate on the table, Mohinder wonders if he’s broken into someone else’s home. ‘Oh, yeah,’ Matt’s voice drifts through the haze in his head. ‘Forgot to tell you. I got us a new kid.’
~ With a grin, Dean dusts off his jeans. “What, did you seriously want Dad to hide some eggs in the cemetery or something?” Sam stuffs his homework next to his crossbow, and shrugs. “No, but... whatever. Let’s just go home.” If Sam finds a tiny chocolate egg in his cereal the next morning, Dean is totally sure he has no idea how it got there.
~
“I got that one when I was blindsided by the ghost of a giant mutated lemur.” When she skitters away, clutching her purse, Dean turns his head slightly. “Did you mind-mojo her into running away?” “Yes,” drawls Sam, nursing his beer. “‘Cause clearly, the lemur line never fails.”
~ “Should we call the police?” Leslie offered. “And tell them what? ‘Hello, officer, there’s a naked man in my basement who I summoned up with a Satanic ritual,’ oh god, my parents were right, I am toying with unholy forces--” Allie took another shaky puff off her inhaler.
~ Then she ducked into my dad’s office, and sat down at the computer; I could see her opening up Google. “Allie,” I yelled over the ring tone, “we are not qualified to perform exorcisms!” She waved over her shoulder at me-- yeah, yeah, I know-- as the voicemail message played again.
~ Leslie, in the meantime, had gotten a damp washcloth from the bathroom, and put it on our guy’s forehead. “What?” she said, off my look. “They do it on Little House on the Prairie.” I decided not to point out that they also went blind from scarlet fever on Little House on the Prairie, and also wished my parents had better taste in old TV shows.
~ “Hey,” she said, “for Midsummer, you want to do something really boring, like bowling or something?” “Actually, that sounds awesome,” I said. “Maybe miniature golf?”
“Great,” she said. “I gotta go home and throw out all my death metal CDs.”
~
“What? At my high school, your options are basically goth, punk, or J.Crew. I’m just making a statement.” “Well, that statement might be ‘unholy powers, I am your vessel’ unless you watch it, okay? You don’t know what you’re messing with.” “I do now! Hi, pentagram scorched into the floor.” I pointed at it, for emphasis.
~ I woke up feeling surprisingly calm, all things considered. My first though was: okay, I’m conscious, my head hurts like hell, therefore I’m not dead. And I could tell I was lying on the living room sofa, so I wasn’t in the hospital either. I risked cracking an eye open. The living room looked like I’d actually thrown the raging kegger my parents had jokingly forbidden before they left for the weekend. Totally trashed. “Oh, god,” I moaned, and tried to sit up. “I’m gonna be grounded until I die.” “Possibly,” Dean Winchester said, from somewhere behind me, “but on the bright side, that’ll be a long-ass time.”
~ “I’m not skinny dipping. You know it’s always better to be overly reverent than under when doing rituals. Nakedness is a show of humility.”
~ “I had some very important business after school.” “You were talking to girls again, weren’t you?” “Very important business,” Dean repeated, “Like, urgent.” “It’s not like they ever say anything. All they do is smile at you.”
~
“What? You’re fine. Just a little—wet,” Dean patted his shoulder and winced at the squish it made, trying to wipe his hands on a different part of the jacket and finding it equally as wet. “And a little sooty. But, hey, we’re not dead.” “I’m gonna have to disagree with your standard of measurement. Wall of flames, Dean! Coming at me!”
~ Dean reached for an answer—and found nothing. “It could have been worse?” Sam stopped and turned, pinning him with a look. “How could it possibly have been worse?” he asked, incredulous. Dean opened his mouth and worked it for a moment; Sam just rolled his eyes. He snapped his fingers in triumph: “She could have poured the gasoline on us. You know, instead of just leading up to us. Then we’d really be hurting.” “Wall of fire! Coming at my head!”
~ “When I was fourteen you wanted my skateboard. When I was sixteen you wanted to drive the car. Hell, when I was five you stood in front of my tricycle and wouldn’t let me ride it!” “And we’re still bitter about it, obviously.” Dean waved that away. “All I’m saying, you covet my things, Sam.” “Covet? I covet? Have you been reading the Bible again?”
~ “It’s really bad at its job?” “Uh-huh. I’m sure all it needs is a refresher course in ‘How to Eat People.’ The Devil probably holds them all the time. Hey, maybe we can give it some tips!”
~ “I’m not helpless, Dean.” “Never said you were.” “No, you’re only giving me the mother of all protection amulets.”
~
“My Latin is top notch. My Latin could beat up your Latin any day.”
~ He wondered, sometimes, when he saw Dean picking out skeins of yarn at Wal-Mart, if Dean were actually colorblind, but when he pointed out that green and purple was kind of a weird combination, Dean looked at him like he was the crazy one.  “Dude, the Joker wears green and purple.” “Yeah, but I don’t think we’re supposed to be using him as a fashion model.”
~ “They brew their own beer,” he says breathlessly, with all the excitement he usually saves for purchasing firearms. “Hence the name ‘brewpub’,” Sam answers automatically, with just enough superiority to sound normal, and make Dean roll his eyes.
~ “Aunt Jessica said you would help us set it up and make sure we didn’t get scared, but we’re not babies, so you don’t have to do that. You’re just going to help us set it up and get the sleeping bags out of the attic.” “I am?” Sam raised his eyebrow and glanced at Dean. “That’s nice of me.” Alex piped up, “Mom said to tell you it was your punishment for not fixing the toilet like you said you would.”
~ Alec turns to Sam. “The Coming ring any bells?”
“Capital C?” Sam asks vaguely. “Sounds apocalyptic.”
~ Shawn insists on calling them abductees because it sounds way cooler than kidnapped
~
Listening to the speech, Shawn felt a smile snaking across his face. “Hey, I know what this is! You’re totally trying to temp me into evil it’s like—” Shawn snapped his fingers. “It’s like that thing in the bible with the desert which totally makes you Satan.” A smile slowly spread across Shawn’s face. “Which means I’m totally Jesus! How dope is that?”
“I think you’re missing the point,” the demon growls.
~ They left for England the next morning. It was depressingly easy to forge the passports and slip through airport security especially considering Sam and Dean were verging into the FBI’s most wanted.
~
At half past five, Dean looked over at Sam and said, “You know this isn’t going to just blow over. There’s no way in hell the government can handle a zombie apocalypse. I’m just about fed up with all the moaning.”
~ Dean rolled his eyes and wandered off to find his raisin bread. He wasn’t really interested in watching Sam have a battle of wills with a demented sea creature.
~ “Tell me, Sam. Is this going to be a recurring thing? Because if so, rent control or not, I don’t plan to live here much longer.” “A guy on your floor made a deal with a demon that came to collect. We handled it. Or my brother did. I got to be bait. I’m always bait.”
~ She pointed to a sofa and said, “Sit down and I’ll try to explain this.” “Was that sofa there a few seconds ago?” Prue laughed again and said, “Let’s stay focused on what’s important.”
~ “Your brother disappeared?” “Not really. I just like to make up elaborate stories to spend time with you guys.”
~ “Yes, getting caught was all part of my clever plan. Now get me out of these chains.”
~ “It’s your fault, Chloe. You couldn’t let it go. You had to know how I figured out who that creepy dude was and you wouldn’t stop harping on it until I explained. And then you followed me here, and because of you, it’s the end of the world as we know it.”
~ “Well, don’t worry about it. No one will be able to figure it out. Want to know why? Because I gave the bad guy the information on the warheads to keep him from killing you. And now we’re all going to die.” “You’re a real optimist. Anyone ever tell you that?”
~ The word “genius” was used without reservation and coming from someone of Fleinhart’s qualifications, that actually meant something.
~
Wyatt set his brother down on the bed as gently as he could. It terrified him that Chris still showed absolutely no reaction to the jostling. This was bad. It was so very, very bad - but he could fix it. He’d been healing near fatal injuries since he was two. He knew he could fix it even though his hands were shaking as he stretched them out over his brother. And then Chris stopped breathing altogether.
“No! Don’t you dare!” Another wave of fury swept through him. The little bastard wasn’t going to die on him. Not now. Their father had told them time and time again that it was love that provided the trigger for healing. Fortunately, Wyatt’s powers seemed to understand that love and anger often go hand in hand, because Chris almost immediately took a strangled-sounding breath and Wyatt started to feel the wounds healing under his hands. 
~
“Okay, okay, I’ll shut up. If it helps any, you’re the only one who got that little detail. Not even my sister heard about that.”
“That’s because you love your sister and want her to remain unscarred, whereas you take a sadistic pleasure in tormenting me.”
~
“So don’t you dare develop a martyr complex over this or I’ll… do something unspecified but horrible.”
~
“Figures you’d come back when I no longer have the authority to shoot you.”
“Never stopped you before.”
~
She feels a little dizzy, like she might faint, and tells herself to wait until after she kicks his ass.
~
“You think Constance was in on Romick’s plot?”
“I’m wondering if Romick was involved in Romick’s plot.”
~
It’s hardly like he’s been the model of fairness thus far. If Lex is going to fire me, he’ll do it, regardless of whether or not I give him a reason.
~
“Don’t tell me…you, too? Is there anyone in this group who hasn’t dated the not-so-lovely Ms. Lane?” she asked scathingly. From the position on the couch where A.C.’s companion had retreated, he raised his hand somewhat tentatively, as if he wasn’t entirely sure the question wasn’t rhetorical. After a moment, he hastily put it down and threw Lois a guilty look.
~
“Apparently angels can hold trials over humans who have been under demonic influence. I had the feeling that Mike was handling the defence, which made me pretty nervous. Number one, because he was only interested in you,” Bobby replied as he pointed to Sam. “Number two, because if one archangel was handling the defence, I figure another archangel had to be handling the prosecution.”
~
Sam thought Bobby took the whole Dean’s-kind-of-an-angel-now thing really well. Man, he liked Bobby! He wondered if Bobby might let him start using ‘Uncle’ Bobby again.
~ With a look, Sam asked for Dean’s permission. Dean shrugged, setting his beer back on the table. Sam took that as permission.
~ “You found them!” a voice exclaimed as they reached the mouth of the tunnel. Why is it that every other professor at this school besides myself seems to find it their mission in life to state the completely obvious?
~ “She said if you’ve got anything to add to our punishment she and the headmaster will support it.” 
“Hot pokers, or the rack? Or boiling in oil, perhaps; my oversized cauldrons should be large enough. Well, if I boil them you at a time, at least. So many difficult choices… I believe the liver of a teenage boy can be used in a variety of potions.”
~
“Six drops if you want the potion to blow up in your face; two if you just want it to turn green.”
~
“My shield didn’t fall so much as collapse inwards, and a couple of the spikes got fused to my spine.”
~ “Pretend you have manners and open the bloody door.”
“Good evening, Alastor, what may I do for you?”
“Die slowly of a horribly debilitating illness. Preferably a non-contagious one so I can enjoy the process.”
~
“Poppy has come to the conclusion that I need some sort of ‘help’ to get past what the Dark Lord did, and to that end she’s assembled a remarkable collection of idiots to drive me insane. Tonight’s visitor was a barely older than most of my robes.”
“Well, considering your usual attire, that’s not saying a great deal.”
“I haven’t completely ruled out hexing you as an appropriate tension reliever.”
“There are a fair number of empty classrooms around if you’d care to try. Though flashback or no, if you set another fiendfyre on me I’m bloody well going to thrash you properly and fair play be damned.”
~
“So you got yourself an ice cream bar, but nothing for me.”
“If I remember correctly, the conversation went a little like…’Hey Dean, I’m going to the store. Do you want anything?’… ‘Quiet Sammy. There’s breasts on television.’”
~ “Calm down, I’m not gonna hurt you.”
“You shot me!” Sam shouted.
“Yeah well, I sort of meant besides that,” he said leaning in closer.
~
It asked in a baffled tone. “Did you miss the part where I said I’d be right back? You weren’t trying to escape, were you?”
“Crap,” Sam said, not really in response.
~ “I look like you? Just kidding. I manifested myself to look like you ‘cause it was the best way to get your attention.” Sam stared in disbelief.
“Just for the record,” Sam stated, “putting a bullet in me is what got my attention.”
~ Bobby motioned toward the gag in Dean’s mouth. “Is that really necessary, Sam?” Snorting, Sam removed it. “Bobby,” Dean said solemnly. “You know you’re not just a friend, right? You’re family. I love you, man. I. Love. You.” Bobby stuffed the gag back in.
~ Sam’s at the library chasing down a lead for Bobby because Dean told him if he had to look at his tired ugly ass for one more minute, he was going back into the coma by choice.
~
Bobby, blinks, grumbles, “Rumsfeld, you damn fool!” as he stumbles out of bed---because this isn’t a danger bark, or a mortal peril yelping, it’s a whiny-ass boo-hooing.
~
“Dean. I’m not ‘destroying our family’. I’m sending you to summer camp. You’ll only be gone a week.”
“But I don’t wanna!” There were times when his seven year old son was mature beyond his years. This was not one of those times. 
~
For the rest of the day, John began to wonder if all toddlers were capable of teleportation or if Sam was especially gifted. It felt like every time John blinked, Sam was out of the room. Every time, John found him with complete strangers.
~ “I already looked there. It’s not on the computer, not in your office, however, there’s a legal pad full of chicken scratches that could be, with the aid of an Ouija board and mind-altering substances, the notes for an exam–” Jane trailed off, smug.
~
“I’ll bring you something shiny from Egypt…yes, something shiny, expensive, and has not been liberated from a corpse, I promise.”
~ The spirit rolled his eyes. ‘I did not say that.’
“Warning, any and all messages from beyond the grave are subject to your medium’s approval. Content may be edited at any time.”  He glared at her. ‘You want the toilet to back up?’
~ “Unfortunately, I’m going to have to turn down your sweet overture. University policy forbids me getting lucky with the students.” “Or the help,” Jane smirked. “Otherwise, she’d be chasing me around the desk daily.” “You two keep this up,” Carolina said, amused. “And folks’ll talk.” “Which you like,” Kate pointed out. “Ms. I-Carry-A-Bullwhip-And-I-Know-How-To-Use-It-Just-Ask-Me-How.”  “You know, with a name like that, I can see why you’d go by Carolina,” Jane said with a smirk.
~
“For someone who spends her spare time dispatching ghosts and lying to cover it up – you really aren’t that good at lying.” “It’s a failing,” Kate agreed. “I generally just rely on my boobs.” ~
“A moment to find out would be good,” she said, irritated. “You want fast service, go to McDonalds.”  “Sorry! I’ll just be over here somewhere, letting you work and, you know, tapping my foot impatiently.”
~ “Jane,” Kate frowned. “Please stop arguing with my father’s ghost. It’s disconcerting.” “Then tell him to quit being an asshole,” Jane sighed.  “Tried that,” Kate shrugged. “Didn’t listen to me then, doubt he will now.”
~
He nodded, looking as though disbelief and respect for his elders were fighting an impossible war in his head and Muriel approved. Somebody’d raised that boy right.

Someone has to stand up to him and say “Jerk!” In, you know, a pretty much nonverbal way since I am not on speaking terms with him.
~
Oh my god, that guy. That guy. I don’t even know his name and I’ve wanted to kick him squarely in the balls for years. It’s like a fantasy. Sooner or later we’ll both be at the 7-Eleven down the road a ways. Maybe I’ll be getting a pack of Camels and he’ll be getting a Slurpee and then BAM. I will ruin his chances of ever having children. And then I will steal his Slurpee. It will be my finest hour.

“Broken in four places,” Sammy announced with glee, brandishing his cast.
~
The hamburger came out of nowhere.  And damn if it didn’t have a disembodied voice as a side dish. “You should eat something.”
~
“So,” she says. “How’s Sam? Still not Antichrist?”
“Nah, but he’s hoping,” Dean says.
~ “Yes, oh bastion of gorgeousness that I am blessed above all men to call wife?”
~
Batman’s gloved hand grips his shoulder. “If you kill him,” he says pragmatically, “he can’t tell you where she is.”

“Didn’t look like it from where I was standing!” “Stand somewhere else.”

And the US Postal Service’s promise of “Everywhere, Every Day” notwithstanding, expecting them to deliver to Sam Winchester, Passenger Seat, ‘67 Chevy Impala (License plates variable), US Highway was asking for a postal miracle of mythic proportions.

“Pay, shmay! It was an accident. I got insurance. Do me a favor—burn the whole place down, why don’t you? I’ll retire on the insurance money to a nice cabin by the lake.”
~ God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won’t tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.

It wasn’t a dark and stormy night. It should have been, but there’s the weather for you. For every mad scientist who’s had a convenient thunderstorm just on the night his Great Work is complete and lying on the slab, there have been dozens who’ve sat around aimlessly under the peaceful stars while Igor clocks up the overtime.

The twentieth century was anything but boring. In fact, a flashing blue light in his rearview mirror had been telling Crowley, for the last fifty seconds, that he was being followed by two men who would like to make it even more interesting for him.
~
Deidre had run across them while being involved in one of her causes, probably the one involving lots of unpleasant South Americans fighting other unpleasant South Americans and the priests egging them on instead of getting on with proper priestly concerns, like organizing the church cleaning rota.
~
Yes, you knew where you were with the Royals. The proper ones, or course, who pulled their weight in the hand-waving and bridge-opening department. Not the ones who went to discos all night long and were sick all over the paparazzi.
[Footnote: It is possibly worth mentioning at this point that Mr. Young thought that paparazzi was a kind of Italian linoleum.]
~
Crowley had always known that he would be around when the world ended, because he was immortal and wouldn’t have any alternative.

“Oh dear,” muttered Aziraphale, not swearing with the practiced ease of one who has spent six thousand years not swearing, and who wasn’t going to start now.

The owner of a voice like that would be the sort of person who, before making a plastic model kit, would not only seperate and count all the pieces before commencing, as per the instructions, but also paint all the bits that needed painting first and leave them to dry properly prior to construction. All that separated this voice from chartered accountancy was a matter of time.

Most books on witchcraft will tell you that witches work naked. This is because most books on witchcraft are written by men.

“I glaim gis oteg in der gaing og der—” he paused. He took the knife out of his teeth and began again.

“Serve everyone right if the witches took over the whole country and made everyone eat health food and not go to church and dance around with no clothes on,” he said, kicking a stone. He had to admit that, except perhaps for the health food, the prospect wasn’t too worrying.

He didn’t say “That’s weird.” He wouldn’t have said “That’s weird” if a flock of sheep had cycled past playing violins. It wasn’t the sort of thing a responsible engineer said.

Sometimes he would scribble something on a sheet of paper by his side. It was covered in symbols only eight other people in the world would have been able to comprehend; two of them had won Nobel prizes, and one of the other six dribbled a lot and wasn’t allowed anything sharp because of what he might do with it.
~
“Surely you have considered terrorist activity?” There was another pause. 
Then the spokesman said, in the quiet tones of someone who has had enough and who is going to quit after this and raise chickens somewhere, “Yes, I suppose we must. All we need to do is find some terrorists who are capable of taking an entire nuclear reactor out of its can while it’s running and without anyone noticing. It weighs about a thousand tons and is forty feet high. So they’ll be quite strong terrorists. Perhaps you’d like to ring them up, sir, and ask them questions in that supercilious, accusatory way of yours.”

Newt always tried to see the best in everyone, but it had occurred to him shortly after joining the WA that his superior and only fellow soldier was as well balanced as an upturned pyramid. “Shortly,” in this case, meant under five seconds.
~
There was the distant sound of a telephone ringing. Both men instinctively ignored it. All the calls were for Madame Tracy anway and some of them were not intended for the ear of man; Newt had conscientiously answered the phone on his first day, listened carefully to the question, said “Marks and Spencer’s 100% Cotton Y-fronts, actually,” and had been left with a dead receiver.

Two farthings = One Ha’penny. Two ha’pennies = One Penny. Three pennies = A Thrupenny Bit. Two Thrupences = A Sixpence. Two Sixpences = One Shilling, or Bob. One shilling = Five Pee. Two Bob = A Florin. One Florin and one Sixpence = Half a Crown. Four Half Crowns = Ten Bob Note. Two Ten Bob Notes = One Pound (or 240 pennies). One Pound and One Shilling = One Guinea.

Along with the standard computer warranty agreement which said that if the machine 1) didn’t work, 2) didn’t do what the expensive advertisement said, 3) electrocuted the immediate neighbourhood, 4) and in fact failed entirely to be inside the expensive box when you opened it, this was expressly, absolutely, implicitly and in no event the fault or responsibility of the manufacturer, that the purchaser should consider himself lucky to be allowed to give his money to the manufacturer, and that any attempt to treat what had just been paid for as the purchaser’s own property would result in the attentions of serious men with menacing briefcases and very thin watches.

He headed for his office, walking like a man carrying a thermos flask of something that might cause, if he dropped it or even thought about dropping it, the sort of explosion that impels grey-beards to make statements like “And where this crater is now, once stood the city of Wah-Shing-Ton”, in SF B-movies.

The lorry blocked the road. And the corrugated iron blocked the road. And a thirty-foot-high pile of fish blocked the road. It was one of the most effectively blocked roads the sergeant had ever seen.

The park was deserted except for a member of MI9 trying to recruit someone who, to their later mutual embarassment, would turn out to be also a member of MI9, and a tall man feeding the ducks.

“I don’t see what’s so terrific about creating people as people and then getting upset because they act like people,” said Adam severely. “Anyway, if you stopped telling people it’s all sorted out after they’re dead, they might try sorting it all out while they’re alive.”
~
“He is so your type. Tall, dark, fabulous body, dreamy eyes, courteous. Heck, he’s everybody’s type!”
~ “You hear that?” He complained to the hangers. “Brains. Should have gone for a dumb girl with a hairbrush instead of a smart one with a sharp object fixation.”
“That’s okay, Jack. I always knew you married me for my knife collection.” 
“That’s the box marked ‘Sharp - Don’t Even Think of Touching This, Jack!’, is it?”
~ Pixie extermination was pretty gruesome and involved a couple of things that Dean would happily never touch again.
~ He was glad that Sam was off ‘finding himself’ or whatever Sam did that meant that he didn’t need Dean anymore, but Dean had carried Sam in his arms, with his grubby little kid fingers wrapped tight around Dean’s collar. Dean knew who Sam was, he’d be happy to find Sam if Sammy would only ask.
~ “And why aren’t they fussing over you? Your clothes are a bigger mess than mine.” “It’s my air of manly self-sufficiency. Hey, you think you could give them my blue shirt and say it’s yours? The sleeve is totally coming off.” “Manly self-sufficiency, huh?” “Sewing isn’t manly.” “But walking around with your sleeve half-off is?” “Sure. It’s rugged.” “You mean ragged.” “That, too.”
~
“Argentinean Wood Dove? I’ve come up with better cover stories than that at two in the morning, drunk off my feet.”
~ “Get your asses out here, you fairy motherfuckers!” Dean stood in the centre of the fairy circle, shouting at the top of his voice. “Come out and talk to me, or I swear to god, I’ll torch your fucking dance floor and salt the earth, don’t think I won’t!”
~
“I just want to talk with them. So just call up whatever it is you call up, and we’ll work it out like civilized people and elves, all right?”
~ From his reading, Dean had had some vague idea that a trip to Faerie involved a lengthy horseback ride, with many symbolically branching roads and possibly a river of blood to wade through. He was kind of disappointed to discover it wasn’t like that at all.
~
Clothing seemed to be optional, but those who bothered were sure as hell making a fashion statement. Dean looked down at his damp, grass-stained sweatpants, and decided that the statement he was making was “fuck you.”
~ “Asshole,” Sam said, and Dean knew he hadn’t come back with a changeling after all.
~ It’s impressive that he can say it all reasonably like that. As if it was a fact, like “people who don’t at least pause when you rack a shotgun are probably not people, so you should go ahead and shoot” or “I, Sam, will never be as fine as you, Dean.”
~
“I’m resting.” “I think you’ll find—”  “That I’m sitting here, and I’m not driving, and I am listening to music which is very fucking soothing—”  “I’m pretty sure Dave Mustaine would beat the crap out of you for that—”  “— to me, and I am resting.”
~
“We could—I’m pointing this out only for contrast—be dead.”
~
“I hope your mattress has fleas, Sammy. I really do.”  “And, well, considering the fact that you’d get them the next time you stole one of my t-shirts... yeah, I’m okay with that.”
~ “I don’t see how this was my fault.”  “You called my name.”  “All I said was ‘Dean, wake up, there’s a diner here that doesn’t look too bad.’ *You’re* the one who woke up, punched me in the *face*, yanked the wheel out of my hands, and drove us off the road.”
~
“Go back to sleep. I promise not to get us horribly killed if I can possibly avoid it.”
~ “Lullaby... and good niiiight...”  “And you can’t sing. At all.”  “Go to sleep little Dean-ie...”  “Jesus, I hate you.”  “Ditto,” Sam says, and smiles, slow and easy.
~ It was possessed when they bought it, of course—that was dad’s idea of a birthday present. Happy Birthday, Dean! Here’s a car. Don’t worry if it moves on its own—that’s just the spirit inhabiting it. Sam would have hated it, probably, but Dean had been thrilled. He’d headed straight out to the driveway with his shotgun in hand, chanting Latin and dodging easily when the car snapped into reverse and tried to run him over.
~ They’d noticed it the next day, when the car had tried to eat Sam—not that a car had a digestive tract, or even a mouth, but that didn’t seem to matter.
~
He was glad Sam was unscathed, but no way was it fair that he was totally unscathed. He should have had wings coming out of embarrassing places. That would have been fair.
~ She eyes the guns on his hips. And the knives in his belt. And the rifle slung across his back. “Overcompensate much?” ~
Clark raises his hands in something like surrender. “The rest of the League tries not to ever question Batman’s reasoning, Robin.” “Because you have social lives?”
~ “Trust me,” Clark says, and then sets fire to Tim’s gauntlets. With his eyes. Only not, because the gauntlets are fireproof and blood on them really... isn’t.
~
This time, Clark smiles at him like Tim had given him actual food, as opposed to Bat-designed nutrition for the Boy Wonder On The Go.  “It’s probably designed to make aliens and meta-humans fatally sick,” Tim says, hoping it’s not.  “I’ll try not to vomit on your suit.” It will never stop being weird to be winked at by Superman. And it also won’t stop being sad that he actually kind of likes the taste of the energy bars now, and it’s also kind of cool to eat one with Superman.
~ She always lets him raid her kitchen, though, and she’s Oracle, which means that there are Tim-specific snack foods exactly where they always are. He watches her watching Black Canary and waits, quietly entertaining an image of his stepmother taking up a life of vigilantism solely to work up the skills to break into the Clocktower and remove every food product lacking in nutritional value.

Bruce announces his presence on the rooftop with a scuff of boot-heel on gravel. Courtesy.
~ He’s actually really cute when he’s sick. All pissed-off and red-nosed and fussy. Babs makes a note to tell him that in a really loud voice next time he’s trying to be cool.
~
‘Am I supposed to be one of the idiots who call you ‘Brucie’ now?’ For a second, he wonders if some part of him said that out loud while he wasn’t paying attention. There’s just this one little flash of Bruce, the real one, in the man’s eyes, and then it’s gone, just like that.
~ “See, I thought it was Ellie I’d invited over for drinks tonight, but it turns out it was Emma, but now Ellie thinks it was her... you see the problem.” He really doesn’t. Translating Brucie to English requires a lot more liquor than Harvey can drink before noon.
~
Bruce takes his hand away, ‘straightening’ his tie in a way that leaves it elegantly off-centre.
~
“No, the other one. The eight foot tall pink one. Hm. Kilowogg—Yeah, him. That’s who I’ll invite over, with Wally, and then...”  “Spend the next three years repairing the damage to your home, reputation, and the neighbouring countryside?”
~ “You,” he says, “have a distinct lack of fun.”  “It’s been said.”  “Some things bear repeating.” And repeating, and repeating, and –
~
“Do you realize that Carrie has what’s colloquially known as a great deal of funk in her trunk?”  “I thought it was ‘junk.’ Junk. In the trunk. Of course, there are regional differences. Etymologically, that is.”  “Et— You’re punishing me for using the word ‘colloquially.’” ~ For a moment, in the thin slash of expression visible above the black of the man’s omnipresent shades, there’s a flicker which isn’t enough like fear for her tastes.
~
“Twenty Questions? Dad taught you every interrogation technique he knows and you’re down to Twenty Questions?”
~ He frowned and stuck a finger in his ear to block out the increasingly loud demands for information. “What? I can barely hear you.” “I know, Bobby,” Fawkes whispered with exaggerated patience. “I’m being quiet, because I think I’m being followed.” “Tell him he’s late,” the Official barked. “You’re late,” Bobby reported. “Yeah, ‘cause I think I’m being followed!”
~ Somehow, Sam couldn’t quite imagine a mystical projection of deadly intent wearing a bright orange bowling shirt. Though it would probably explain a lot about both Hell and bowling.
~
“Did you not hear me pluralize? Weapons! Down!” So much for that idea. They emptied their clothes in silence, exchanging helpless, furious looks as the piles of weapons started to mount.
~ Alex turned to stare at him, and saw one of the kids copy the gesture— futilely, given the blindfold over his eyes, but she could imagine him blinking in Fawkes’ general direction. “Pig Latin?” he asked in obvious disbelief. “Stealthy, dude.”
~ “Hey, man, you’re the one who said my name.” “It could’ve been a code name, you ever think of that?” “No, Hobbes, I didn’t. You know why? ‘Cause it’s my name.” “They didn’t know that, Fawkes.” “Uh, actually, we did,” Dean said. “Nice try though. Very professional.”
~ “Don’t apologize, Fawkes,” Hobbes said, as he swerved into an illegal left turn. “They’re terrorists. They don’t get apologies.” This time both of them grunted, in what sounded like protest. “Are too,” said Hobbes, who apparently spoke Duct Tape, along with rewriting the dictionary when it suited him.
~ “I know about the murder you’re investigating. I also know that Fawkes didn’t do it.” “Thank you, sir,” Fawkes said. “Because he’s too damned ineffectual to rip a woman apart with his bare hands.” Fawkes said, “Never mind.”
~ “Welcome to the stalemate. Got any cards or anything?” “Oh, excuse us if the invisible killing thing isn’t exciting enough for you,” Hobbes shot over his shoulder.
~ “All fungi are edible…some just aren’t edible more than once.”
~
“You’re using my orders against me,” said Jack. “I think I hate you.” Ianto grinned cheekily.
~ “I got you tea,” said Jack, and set it down on the tray table, next to a sorry-looking bowl of hot cereal. Ianto picked up the hot cup, cradling it in careful hands, and took a sip. He put the tea back down, and said calmly, with a perfectly straight face, “That’s awful.” Jack felt his mouth stretching into a grin. “There’s a reason why I make you do it,” he said.
~ Everything began to make sense the day that Dean got shot in the head.  He recovered five minutes later, bitching about his headache and the blood all over his jacket. The thing was, Sam wasn’t even worried during those five minutes. He had known Dean would come back. He couldn’t explain how he knew, but he had.
~
“Jesus! The looks on your faces,” chortled Connor, gasping and laughing, tears in his eyes. “Oh God. I told you to lighten up. The gun wasn’t loaded, see?” To demonstrate, Connor depressed the trigger a few times, and the gun clicked hollowly. Dean stared at the crazy man lying under him. Before standing, Dean punched him in the face again. Just on general principle.
~
“Are you an alien?” Emmett asked suddenly, squinting at Connor. Connor looked bewildered. “I have a green card…” “No! Did you operate on my brain?” “I…” Connor stopped, actually hearing the question. “Did I what?”
~
But they were lost. Which meant that Dean, who assumed “getting lost” was just something that happened to other people, was well and truly pissed off. He almost took it as a personal affront, like the road was doing it on purpose to them. And, given their line of work, Sam thought that might be a possibility.
~
The question hung in the air for a long moment, and Sam wanted to say I think I’m going crazy, Dean, but instead, what came out was, “I’m sort of thirsty.”
~
“As far away from that crazy bitch as possible,” Dean bit out. “You really think Meg survived the fall?” Dean took a moment to look away from the road and shoot Sam a glare that said he thought Sam was being a fucking idiot. “Right,” said Sam.
~
“Dude, I need to stitch that wound.” “I know. See how happy I look?”
~
“Do you… do you think I’m a bad person?” Sam asks. “You’re the most selfish bastard I’ve ever known,” says Dean, deadpan.
~
Sam wakes up to the smell of buttery toast and the sound of a sizzling frying pan. When he opens one eye and looks over at the other side of the room, he sees that Dean is cooking. “I’m still dreaming, right?” Sam sits up a little.  “If you so much as think about saying something smartass, I will stab you,” adds Dean, pointing his hunting knife at Sam for emphasis.
~ “Are we high? What’s in this ice cream?” Sam asks, bewildered.
~ A hand jiggles Dean’s foot and Dean instinctively turns in his bed, whipping his other leg up in a roundhouse kick. Another hand catches his foot before it can make contact. “Dude. It’s me, chill,” says Sam’s voice, low and amused, and he lets Dean’s legs go.
~ “How will we make it across the border with a car full of weapons? And you being legally dead?” Sam smacks Dean’s hand when Dean reaches over to snag a sausage link from Sam’s plate, but Dean smacks Sam back and takes the sausage anyway. Sam adds, scowling, “You won’t be able to get by the customs police with a fake ID.” “Sammy, where’s the faith? Have I ever let you down?” Dean says around a mouthful of sausage.
 And Sam grinds his teeth, because the most annoying thing is… Dean hasn’t. But Sam doesn’t give Dean the satisfaction of hearing Sam admit it aloud. “This better not involve dressing me up in a teddy bear suit again.” “Dude. You were ten. I think it’s time to let it go. And how else were we going to get into that psycho toymaker’s shop?” Sam flags the waitress down to ask for their check. “Remember those conversations I miss not having? Add psycho toymakers to the list.” Dean munches on his last strip of bacon. “Don’t forget flesh-eating funguses.”
~ “If by ‘idiotic,’ you mean ‘brilliant,’ then I agree.”
~ “I’m not really an animal,” she says finally. “I’m… a representation. I mean, I’m real, but I’m not exactly—” Dean holds up a hand. “Too tired for existentialism right now,” he says. “No food; got it. Keep an eye on the car for a second, will ya?”
~ “I think you might be the most boring drunk in the universe,” said Dean conversationally. “One beer and you’re out like a light.”
~ Normal people just said, “Colonel Mustard, in the Conservatory, with the candlestick.” Dean made up the most unusual deaths he could think of. Colonel Mustard would string a vine across the floor, and would strategically place the candlestick, upright on the floor, so that when Boddy tripped on the vine, he’d land facedown and get the candlestick shoved through his mouth. It’d go in so hard that Boddy would choke to death, deep-throating the candlestick. “Sucking on the candlestick, choking on his own drool and blood, writhing on the floor, turning blue. And Colonel Mustard would just polish his monocle and wait for him to die.”
~
“You really shouldn’t mock me when I’m holding a loaded rifle,” said Sam.
~
“Going stag?” Dean asked. “That’s actually sort of cool, Sam. I didn’t know you had it in you.” Sam didn’t say anything. Realization dawning, Dean crowed, “You have a date? With a girl?” “Dean,” said Sam, and oh man, that was a real death glare Sam had going on there. “It’s a fair question. I mean, we’re talking about you.” He ducked when Sam pelted a bar of soap at him. “Seriously. A girl? A human girl?”
~ “Superspeed,” says Dean, like that’s an answer.
~ “We need your help,” the young man says, and he sounds angry, he sounds furious, but May understands that tone. Her husband had always sounded angry when he was scared out of his wits, too. Almost as an afterthought, the young man adds, “Please.”
~ “He’s not for eating, man,” says Ash absently as he moves his bishop across the board, and what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
~
“You’re so smart, baby. I don’t know how all your brains fit inside your head. Do you keep brains in your pockets?”
~
“You have clothes on,” said Sam, doing little to hide the relief in his voice.
~
“Enough for me to blackmail you for years to come.” Sam cracked a grin. “You did confess your love to me once or twice. It would’ve been awkward if it wasn’t so hilarious.” “Ah god.” Dean groaned, covering his eyes with one hand. “Winchester rule number 18. Anything spoken during concussions or drug comas must instantly be forgotten. You know that.” Sam grinned more openly. “Denver, winter 1998. I remember.” “You’re not supposed to! That’s the whole point.”
~ “I don’t know, Hendrickson. I don’t do real well with authority figures.” “That’s going to be a problem,” said Hendrickson, “seeing as how you are one now.”
~ “She trying to kill us from the grave by making Sam randomly freak out?”
~ “I’m calling you Bob,” Sam decides, knowing it’s probably ludicrous to name the embodiment of Dean’s fierce protectiveness, but sometimes Sam knows you just have to roll with the punches.
~ This both puzzles and amuses Dean who wonders aloud why someone so boring as Sam, who can stare off into space for hours when they’re driving, has such trouble crossing his legs and emptying his mind. “Some of us aren’t lucky enough to start out with a mind that’s pretty much empty,” Sam rejoinders and Missouri has to chase Dean out before the ensuing wrestling match destroys any of her furniture.
~
Premise = Dean and Sam are Zombies: “Dude, you smell like death.”  “Every day, Dean? Do we have to do that joke every day?”  “Be nice,” Dean snaps. “I’m sewing your hand back on aren’t I?”  “Because you threw a machete at me!” Sam cries, smacking his other hand over his face.  “Who told you to try and catch it?” Dean snorts, wincing a little when a particularly stubborn knot just won’t work its way through the flesh of his brother’s wrist. He figures that’s good enough and ties off, grinning to himself because the only thread he’d been able to find was bright pink.
“So, should we try burial at a crossroads again?” Sam asks, picking at his stitches absently until Dean slaps his hand away.  “Nah, I really don’t think that works. We could try the silver stake?”  “That just gave me a rash.”  “Burning?”  “Can we leave that till last?”  “What else have we got?”  “Painted blue under moonlight and saying our names backwards three times.”  “Now you’re just making shit up.”  “It’s quite possible that I am.”  ~
“Are bits just going to start dropping off?” Dean asks, one foot cradled in two hands, wiggling his toes back and forth.  “We don’t have leprosy,” Sam snorts from the other side of the motel room. “Well, it’s not like blood is circulating. Isn’t that gangrene?” “Oh my god,” Sam groans, lying back on his bed and slapping a hand to his face. “You’re dead and a hypochondriac.” Dean thinks it may just be worth popping off a toe just to see the look on Sam’s face if he hits him square in the forehead with it.
~ “So, all the zombie movies I’ve ever seen,” Dean starts, tone conversational. “The zombies are more… bitey.” “You feel the urge to bite someone?” Sam asks, squinting at Dean in the dying light.  “Not particularly.” “Well, then movies are full of shit,” Sam says, like he’s solving one of the great mysteries of the world. “I am feeling a bit peckish, actually,” Dean amends. “But I’m more in the mood for a cheeseburger than brains.” “You can’t eat. You can’t actively digest food anymore so it’ll just sit in your belly and rot and you’ll smell worse than you already do.” “I’m willing to take that… hey!”
~ His face was filled with glee, like a kid on Christmas morning. “Sam, dragons!” he crowed. “I haven’t gotten to kill any of these in years.”
~
“Ahem!” Dean cleared his throat loudly and brought his hand up to his ear in an imitation of a phone. “Hello, Mrs Bill Bloggs? We have your children. They are perfectly safe but we can’t give them back right now. Why not you ask? Well, we can’t tell you that either. What are two men doing with three small children? I assure you, absolutely nothing dodgy. Why should you believe us you say? Well, let me pass you to my brother and he can explain why it’s much more comforting for your children to be kidnapped rather than just missing.” Dean raised his eyebrows and held his hand-phone out to Sam, who slapped it away irritably.
~ “He likes you,” Sam offered and the dog seemed to look at Sam, then at Dean and back at Sam as if to say, I what?!.
~
“Grosser than the ogre guts?” Dean asked with a quirked eyebrow.  Sam seemed to think about it and then shrugged. “How is this my life? Babysitting a severed hand.”  A second finger poked through the ever-widening hole in the box and Dean grunted. “You were right, it’s making a bid for freedom.” ~
“She tried to kill you while I was in the room, Sam! Don’t you dare waste any sympathy on her, not for a second. There’s crazy with grief, and then there’s animating a hand and attempting to strangle someone.”
~ “Dude, I will give you five seconds to stop that before you have to explain to a doctor how a phone got that far up your ass.”
~ “If you want to feel less like a dork you can take the helmet off.”  “You hit me in the head three times, Dean,” Sam snapped, scowling. Dean just grinned.  “I know, and now you’re wearing the helmet it’s less fun,” Dean snorted.
~
“Where’s your sissy crossbow?”  “I don’t know. Someone once told me that a shotgun made me look more badass.” Sam grinned.  ~ “Not sure, but I’m not going to take any chances. I’ll shoot him and stab him with everything in the trunk and then see if he gets up.”
~ Dean looked at Sam sharply, wondering whether Bobby had asked him first but by the way Sam wouldn’t meet his eyes, Dean knew he was only being told as a courtesy.
~
“There’s a whole apple pie left because I hid it from you.”
~ “So we saw signs of wrath and lust and gluttony,” Bobby said, Dean turning around with a full mouth and a raised eyebrow.  “That’s how he always eats,” Sam remarked.
~ When Barney just blinked at him blankly, Sid sighed. “How’d I get lumbered with such a moron?”
“‘Cause you got the last moron killed?” Barney hazarded with a grin. “And nobody would put up with your stupid ass that wasn’t related.”
~ “Holy… we did not shoot down a goddamn angel… did we?” Barney yipped, panic tingeing his tone. 
Sid turned a raised eyebrow on him. “You want to blaspheme a little more, just in case?”
~ “They’re selling live gargoyles?” Dean asked, incredulous, then rolled his eyes. “I can’t believe I’m having a conversation where I have to say the word gargoyle more than once.”
~
“A bunch of cats were going missing in town and we couldn’t figure out why. I modified a bunch of id chips with a GPS so we could track any that disappeared.” “You did what?” “Don’t sound so surprised,” Melinda sniffed. “I went to MIT before I decided I liked animals more.” “You…” Dean was at a loss. “Okay, point though?” “You came over to dinner I think maybe three weeks after I chipped all the cats and you were talking about how Sam was flying further out and you were worrying and… I just… I told him I was giving him a shot for wing rot. I meant to tell you but then… stuff happened.” “You can track Sam?” “Yes! Just give me five minutes and I’ll have a location for you.” “Mel…” Dean was at a complete loss. He knew something like a tracking chip would be just exactly the thing to make Sam’s head explode, invasion of privacy and all that but if it was about to save his life…”Hang on,” Dean said. “You gave me a flu shot at the same time.” “Um, yes, that was… that was just a flu shot,” Melinda assured but Dean didn’t quite believe her.
~ Sid turned his head slightly, expecting to still see Barney by his side but instead there was a man with short hair plastered to his head, about six foot and with the biggest gun Sid had ever seen pointed at his temple. “Uh… hi,” Sid said, swallowing hard.
~ Dean was making a beeline for the loose grouping of men because he was pretty sure he would actually find the BBQ behind them.
~
“Uh, yes?” Dean tried because his fallback position was always the truth and no appropriate lie presented itself in his traitorous brain that would allow for escape.
~ “There better be a really fucking brilliant explanation for this,” Sam growled through clenched teeth when he came home to find Gina tied to a chair in the living room and Dean sitting opposite with a gun on her.
~ “I’m sorry? We just tell her that she’s a magical creature made up of mud and twigs and we’re going to have to crack open her skull?” “Well, when you say it like that it sounds stupid,” Sam snapped, frowning.  “Am I supposed to try it with an accent?”
~ It is an unwritten rule of the universe that the moment a person is bound, wrists, ankles, and chest to a large tree in the middle of nowhere, his nose will inevitably begin to itch.
~
“A cactus. You spy a cactus. Dean, you always spy cacti.”
~
Dean lays on his back for a moment, looking up at the ceiling and still laughing. He thumps his chest once and then waggles his fingers. “I missed you thumbs!” he announces and that sets Sam off again.
~
“Who you calling a mere mortal?”
~ “Mr Fish!” he cried, darting over to the sink and huffing a sigh of relief when he saw the goldfish doing lazy laps.  “You left with milk this morning,” Dean said and Sam looked up at him, shrugging.  “I traded with Jimmy Miller,” he said, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.
~ Dean finally comes up with the plastic bone, shaped like nothing John has actually seen inside the human body, beaming in triumph. Sammy rolls over and at the top of his lungs decrees, “BZZZT!” Dean proved proficient at the game in about half an hour, much to Sammy’s displeasure, who is now helpfully supplying the missing noise.
~ “Sammy,” John says and his five year old looks up, seemingly unaware of what he’s just done. “What do we say about swearing?” “Not in front of Daddy?” Sammy hazards with his face scrunched up and John catches sight of Dean sliding sideways out of his chair, like he’s preparing to make a run for it.
~ “Are we in the werewolf’s house?” Dean asked slowly.  “It’s Sally’s house, he just stays here.”
~ Dean learnt long ago that screaming for extended periods could get you whatever you wanted from adults that weren’t Dad.
~ Hospitals tended to have pretty good drugs, and if this was how he felt on good drugs he didn’t want to know what in the freak had happened to him.
~ “I’m assuming there’s a title in there somewhere?”  “Yeah, but you aren’t serving under me so it’s pretty pointless,” John says with a dismissive wave.
~ She has an accent he can’t place and Dean realises that it’s because she may very well not have originally come from Earth. He tries not to be completely thrown by the idea.
~ Sam is leaning in the doorway, hands on the outside and that half-pissed, half-amused look he always gets on his face when Dean has brought a girl back to a motel room they’re sharing and he’s going to have to sleep in the bathtub.
~ Dean hesitates in the doorway and watches a pale man with brown hair question someone’s masculinity, sneer at someone else’s theories and demand to know who Dean is, all in one long drawn out breath.
~ John makes a helpless gesture with his hand and Elizabeth knows he is not being vague, is just trying to find a way to be diplomatic.
~ “Maybe it was when I did-” Sam has his hands hovering over the screen again. Dean moves back into the small room to slap them away.  “How about we instigate a no touching rule, huh?” he grates and Sam flushes.
“So should it be weird that we’re in space? I mean, has it just not sunk it yet or something?” Sam asks, blatantly ignoring Dean’s new rule and running his hands over the wall opposite, tracing what looks like strange writing with his fingers.  “Sam, we hunt ghosts, werewolves and vampires. With the whole alien thing we’re just… well-rounded.” 
~ “I notice you never make fun of meditation when she’s within earshot,” Ronan observes.
~
“No questions. No talking, no interacting, just no,” he snaps, stabbing a finger in the direction of a stool. “Park it there and be silent.”
“I could, or I can wander the halls and touch things. For some reason I get the feeling you guys don’t like that.”
~ He spots Elizabeth on the other side of the room, weaving her way through her people and he can tell without even hearing her that she is throwing out orders right and left. She has her arm in what looks like a sling made out of someone’s t-shirt but effectively evades the medical personnel that keep trying to pin her down.
~ “You don’t happen to have knives on you, do you?” Teyla asks, not really expecting anything but when Sam starts patting himself down, she realises it wasn’t such a ludicrous question after all.
~ They left a small amount of their population on the surface of their planet play-acting at being primitive while they grew and expanded underground, hiding their technology so the Wraith wouldn’t feel threatened.
~
“We’re kind of like Men in Black,” Sam said by way of explanation. “Without Will Smith. Or the suits and we keep our names and… you know what? We’re nothing like Men In Black but you get the gist, right?”
~
“Must you injure me every time you see me?” he complained, but couldn’t hide the genuine grin of pleasure at her presence. “I know how you love to visit the infirmary and it is my duty as a friend to give you a genuine need.”
~ “I have every right to say no because what you are proposing is messing with our brains and I happen to be very attached to mine.”  “Like you’d miss it,” Rodney sniped, not being able to help himself.
~ It came out of nowhere and raked bloody furrows into his cheek and that was when he stopped playing nice and started throwing punches.
~ “Are you going to answer everything with a question, because that is going to get old really fast.”
~ The mutt buys his way into the girls’ eternal affections by disappearing for an hour and turning back up with a pair of rabbits in his jaws.
~ “I feel good about today,” John said.  “Oh great, completely jinx us! Now we’re going to be hogtied by natives that want to marry you off to the tribal daughter and eat me by the end of the day.”
~ Whatever providence smiled, allowing him to be so close and not on the other side of the country, allows him to drive pretty much the whole way with his foot down flat on the accelerator without incident. Okay, nearly without incident but the motorbike cop was so ridiculously easy to lose that it hardly counts.
~ “I knew it,” Sam crows, doing a little dance in the middle of their living room that Dean wishes desperately he had a camera for.
~
“Sonic Screwdriver….It does anything he needs it to, really. It’s basically a portable plot device.”-K
~
“Yeah, the guest list includes the custodial staff at the Planet, the bartender at Dooley’s, and a U.S. Senator,” Lois said. To their disbelieving looks, she added, “For once I cleared someone’s reputation instead of exposing a scandal – go figure.”
~
If you like Numb3rs... no, never mind. If you have any concept of what Numb3rs is, you really need to check this out. It will mess with your head, and you will thank it for the privilege.
~
“So,” Sam turns his head, slow and deliberate. “Now what?”
“Hell if I know.” And that’s how they wind up driving aimlessly through Wyoming. Their first stop is a gas station in Godknowswhere. 
Sam murmurs, “Pull over,” and Dean smirks.  “Should have gone before we left.” Sam’s face twists into a glare. “You’re still bleeding.” The asshole is implied. Dean’s bitch is in the slight widening of his grin. The door slam tells him Sam heard. He strokes the dashboard comfortingly.
~
There’s another that claims the best milkshakes in the state are waiting for him at Dirty Sally’s, and he can’t pass that up. There’s a woman behind the counter old enough to be his grandmother who gives him the once-over and grins lecherously. He’s pretty sure she’s Sally.
~
Zbigniew Ollnytzkiej was the kind of teacher students prayed for and then cursed as they struggled through diabolical problem sets at 4AM in the CompSci labs. That second year in Nevada he taught them strategy, or Survival of the Least Stupid, and refused to either shorten his first name or help them pronounce his last.
~
“Oh, you know.  Same old, same old.  You got kidnapped, but we mounted a daring rescue and got you back.  Now you’re taking up space in the infirmary when you’re going to be just fine.”
~ You don’t brake for ghosts on an icy road, Sam’s rational brain is saying, sort of like a normal person thinks Don’t swerve around squirrels, it’s too dangerous and not worth it.  
~ “Why didn’t he fight back?” Ben asks, because Sam’s always encouraged him to be curious. 
“He’s not trained to, I guess.” 
Ben looks back to where the woman is fussing over the boy. “She must not love him very much.” 
“She hopes he’ll never have to fight.” Ben’s incredulous look says exactly what he thinks of that idea.
~ The shot-gun Ben levels at his face seems to make the guy reconsider. Sam’s Glock convinces him he’d be much happier leaving.
~ He had never got to sit in the front before, Momma said he was still to young. The front seat was like, the coolest thing ever.
~
“The ‘Ya Ya Sisterhood’,” Sam said to his comatose brother. “I heard that’s a good book. First thing tomorrow, I’m gonna read it aloud to you. Then ‘Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Café’. Chick Lit 101, that’s what they teach in ICU, Dean.”
~ “I have to choose carefully so I don’t scandalize your virgin ears.” 
“Nice to know there are orifices you won’t go for,” Sam said, then ducked reflexively when he saw Dean reach for something to throw. 
~ They knew the drill - someone kicks the door in, assume it’s the cops and get on the floor.
~ Stephen threw up his arm and dropped to the floor. He didn’t end up shot because Sam and Dean were doing variations of the same thing, only they were whirling around to face the source of the brilliant light that had just flooded the room.
~ “I was being polite! I didn’t think she wanted to be eaten.” “If you’re polite to Sybil, she usually takes it as an insult,” Stephen sighed. It apparently was a long-standing situation.
~ He had forgotten about the hockey stick till about half-a-second before Sam tripped over it again, flipping up feet first in a spectacular example of how to not avoid alerting a monster.
~
“Dean, you weren’t breathing. I gave you CPR. Which saved your life.” “Yeah, and you had been eating onion rings a few minutes ago.”
~ He ignored Dean. He was calm and serene. He was a rock. He was mentally listing twenty horrible things that could happen to Dean’s coat.
~
Dean began reading the inscription. “General Felix Agnus. Born July fourth, eighteen thirty-nine. Died October thirty-first nineteen twenty-five. Independence Day to Halloween. Cool.” “And it tells us..?” Dean turned from the grave with a crooked smile. “He had great timing.”
~
“Here’s the deal. I’m not going to say a word. I will listen to you have nightmare after nightmare and I won’t say a word.” That seemed a little too good to be true. “What’s the catch?” “You go insane, I lose all my family and Dad never gets found.”
~ “We could dig him up, salt and burn but I think Jethro The Happy Groundskeeper might notice a sudden barbeque.”
~ “In 1962 the arm was found in his trunk. At the time he said Aggie had cut her own arm off and given it to him in a fit of grief.” “Sure, ‘cause grief can make statues do crazy things.”
~ “And then dad called in a specialist and there was coffee. Well, coffee and a werewolf. But that was unrelated.”
~
“Consecrate the ground with Holy Water?” “It’s a Christian cemetery; I think they may have it covered. What about the tree itself?” “It’s not the tree; it’s just covering the bleed. We need some kind of … Holy duct tape.” “I don’t think that’s Vatican approved.”
~
“Did the specialist survive?” “Marco? Oh, yeah … he said he’d never liked his left leg anyway.” Dean’s expression was completely deadpan and Sam suspected the best thing he could do would be to ignore the answer entirely.
~
“You read the exorcism. Your Latin’s better.” “And you’ll be-” “Listening, with brotherly pride. Like when you were in that nativity.” “As something tears your arm off…And you stole my sheep! I had to go on with a pig. What kind of shepherd has a pig?” Dean blinked. “You were six. Do me a favour and reconcile at least one thing from after tenth grade before you die, okay?” “I feel weirdly better. You read.” “Too late, I called demon duty.” “This isn’t like calling shotgun.” “It’s exactly like calling shotgun; you’re never going to get there before me.”
~ Sam woke with a start and a hand holding him down. He almost turned his head but a brief effort convinced him this would be an incredibly bad idea. “A really pretty nurse took a lot of time and effort into stitching you up, that is no way at all to repay her.” Dean. Sam blinked and then minimally raised his head to see a very pretty blond nurse smiling at Dean from across the room.
“I’m lying in a hospital bed and you’re picking up women?” “No! One woman.”
~ “You have fifty-two stitches, a minor concussion and all your limbs. As a souvenir from lovely Maryland you’ll have a six inch scar over your ribs but it’s okay, chicks dig scars.” “You?”
“Me? I have no feelings about your scars.” Sam stared at him balefully. “A broken wrist, thirty stitches and a black eye Nurse Marie assures me doesn’t do a thing to detract from my devastating good looks. You didn’t stay reading the book.” “And you didn’t die.” “No, that’s true.”
~
Not that he’s complaining at the moment, because demon or dog, nasty teeth are nasty teeth and he can feel all four punctures like the dog’s teeth were dipped in acid.
~
Dean grins at him, waggles the gun. “Sampler load. Let’s try silver…Okay, oak load…” “Oak?” Sam asks, staring at him. He’d really like to stretch his leg out but the circle’s not that big. “Little, itty, bitty wooden stake.” Dean sounds inordinately pleased with himself. “Great if it’s a vampire, which it is not,” Sam points out.  “Could be a vampire familiar.” The dog yelps but doesn’t drop. “Holy water,” Dean says, sounding really put out
“What else have you got in there?” “Oil of rose, mercury…and uhm, rock salt and rowan ash. Let no tradition go untried.”
~
“I meant to use Christening oil, not rose oil, okay? For the unbaptised risen dead. I picked up the wrong bottle out of my kit.”
~
“I like the way it smells,” Dean says, which is as lame as it gets. He’s halfway asleep when Dean adds softly, “It reminds me of Mom.” Nothing reminds Sam of his mother.
~
Dean had been pretending to sleep for over an hour now. It was supposed to be his way of letting Sam know that Dean trusted him with his car and to give Sam some personal space.
~ “We just crawled through a tunnel of muck, are currently sitting in a smelly basement, and whatever’s in that fractal? Is about to come out. And it’s pissed. So tell me,” Dean asks irritably, shaking god knows what off his hands, “how can do you consider this to be a good date?” “Well,” she yells, over the loud hissing of the opening fractal in front of them. “For one thing, you haven’t tried to kill me yet!” “Who the hell have you been dating?!”
~
He was working to keep it together, concentrating on staying calm instead of just going off on Jim; not because Jim deserved it, or even because he was angry at Jim; but rather because Jim could take it—Jim would take it—and he’d understand why he was taking it.
~
He rose to his feet and crossed to the small bathroom she’d decorated in purple posies despite his protestations that he’d prefer the theme to be ducks. Not cute, yellow ducks swimming around with cute, yellow bills; but rather, the kind of brown and green ducks a man could think about shooting while he was doing his business. Which was, of course, why the room ended up purple and full of posies.
~ “How many times have you seen it now?” she asked rhetorically.
“Big guns. Heroic guys. Lotsa blood. How could the number of times I’ve seen it be relevant?”
~ Victor recognized the return address as that of a prominent divorce attorney. Well, then. Looked like she had meant it, after all. He was going to sign the papers. He owed her that much, at least – he’d stood up and promised her for better or for worse, and then proceeded to give her a whole mess of worse and precious little of better. Oh, he’d sign them.
~
These things are simultaneous: the headlights on the still-running car flicker. The EMF meter stuck in Dean’s duffle shrieks. A biting-cold wind rips through the air. They are back-to-back in less than a heartbeat. Sam searches the horizon, ready if anything comes at them from the treeline; Dean scours their immediate surroundings, ready if anything materializes near them.
~ Turns out demons are real FYI – ghosts are real, too. So are werewolves. Vampires. Changelings. Evil clowns that eat people. If it makes you feel better, Bigfoot’s a hoax.
~
“Are you sure we shouldn’t pop up there and make sure you don’t take up baby-eating and riding brooms at night?” “Dean, I’m a Chinese witch. If I had a broom, the only thing I’d use it for is to beat your stupid culturally-inept skull into mush.”
~ “You wouldn’t because the Vanir fed off the sacrifices. He kept down the ghosts…oh, shit. He’s not there anymore, is he? Shit. Note to self: avoid Indiana for the next four fucking decades and eight years. God, I feel sorry for whoever’s county coroner down there.”
~ “…she threw one at him, it hit him in the head and knocked him off-balance so he fell down the stairs, so it makes sense that he’d be afraid of them. They’re part of how he died. So we can use them to scare him off long enough to find his body, salt it and burn it. This is gonna make things easier.” Sometimes Dean really, really wanted to know how ghosts got made. Like, did they have a choice about what their restrictions were, or did some higher power arbitrarily set those? ‘cause if it was the first one, then man, he had to wonder about this guy. Sam coughed. “Dean? Are you okay?” “Huh? Oh, I’m fine. Fine.” Dean even picked the other one up and looked it straight in the eye, just to prove how fine he was. He was an experienced, butt-kicking monster hunter who’d seen just about everything nasty and seen it buried, too. He was totally okay with this. “Yeah, right,” Sam snorted. Then he flicked his eyes up, the disbelief in his face slowly crossing into amusement. “What? Don’t tell me it’s because these aren’t badass enough for you.” “Sam. That ghost is responsible for five deaths, seven hospitalizations and the decline of an entire neighbourhood. It doesn’t respond to salt. It nearly killed us back there, and the only reason it didn’t…” Fine, Dean wasn’t okay with this. But was it really that much to ask? After all, he went through all the trouble to take monsters seriously, to the point that he was a freak in normal human society, so was it that hard for the monsters to take the whole thing seriously, too? “Oh, for God’s sake—these are bunny slippers, damn it! This is ridiculous!” Not a muscle was out of place in the straight face Sam pulled. He needed to start taking on more of the pool hustling and poker if he was going to be like that. “Dean, they’re ghost-repelling bunny slippers.” 
~
Sam still hadn’t worked out how to have the; ‘Didn’t you die?’ ‘Yeah, well, but. . .’ conversation yet. He had a feeling that it wasn’t going to go well and the last thing he needed was for Dean to try and exorcise his ass.
~
“I can’t talk to you, Sam. You’re not here.” “Yes I am.” “No, you’re not.” Sam huffed out a breath he didn’t need. One pristine wing reached out and cuffed Dean around the head. “Dammit, ow.”
“Felt that did you?”
~ “Dean, man, you did not just call the end of the world pretty.” Sam snorted. It was a strange wet sound, amusement mixed with a dash of internal bleeding.
~ Dean put his hands on his hips.  “You’re kidding.” He looked down.  The cat tipped its head back and looked up.   “Sam, is that you?”  There was a moment, and then the cat nodded slowly, up and down.  A clear gesture. “Sam, you cut that out right now.  It’s not funny.”
Sam tilted his head on one side and said nothing. Dean sighed.  “Great.” He wanted to make a joke involving the word ‘pussy.’  He really, really wanted to make that joke.  But every time he tried, his brain shut down from the enormity of the fodder available to him.
~
“I’m gonna miss running naked all over the place. It was very freeing. On the other hand – pockets.”
~ Sam couldn’t help the snort. “I don’t remember exhibitionism ever being an issue with you before, Dean.” The glare his brother sent him was lethal. “What?” Sam said defensively. “You’re the one who streaked across the stage at my graduation, you jerk!” 
~ “You don’t have to climb the fence. There’s a gap in the chain link down by the…” He trailed off at the interested stares from his aunt and uncle. “I mean…” Luke raised an eyebrow at him. Jake dropped his eyes, focusing on his plate. “You know, that’s what other kids say.”
~
“No, he’s a bio-ortho-something or other – some technical term that changes every year – anyway, he knows guys who know guys.”
~
“I met him,” Lucy quipped. “He’s cute.” Lois glared across the table at her sister.
“I’d say he’s hot.”
“Mom!” Lois gasped. “You can’t say that!”
Ellen waved dismissively at her. “I can see can’t I?”
Lois turned to her father. “Dad, make her stop.” Sam Lane bore the patient demeanor of a man used to being surrounded by women. 
Facing the pleading expression of his eldest daughter, he asked, “Well, is he cute or is he hot?”
~
“You see this is why I hate the internet! Every time I get a good piece of blackmail on someone, somehow it gets leaked to the world before I get a chance to use it!”
~ “I did not ‘tear up’,” he snarled. “I had a slight cold and had a stuffed nose! And I dare you to prove otherwise!”
~ “One is a big guy called Stew, because that’s what he turns peoples’ faces into. If it gets ugly, I want you to leave Stew to me.”
~ Bobby never hears the name Winchester connected with any of this. Robert Plant. Dave Matthews. Steve Winwood. Elwood MacGillicuddy. Bobby smiles a little and shakes his head when he hears that.

They sit there for a moment, creak of leather, salt in their saddlebags, razor sharp silver knives and special ammo loads. Death and blood and vengeance. Justice and light. Dusty blue denim and worn leather marked with protection runes painted by fingers dipped in holy water.
~
Bobby grunted. “Research is a process,” he said. “Not a one-to-one exchange between time invested and information gleaned.”
~
“After much studied research on the subject, I’ve come to the conclusion they exist for the singular purpose of pissing me off. Same reason as you do, for that matter. At least, that’s my working theory anyway.”
~ He might be a betraying dickweasel fuckhead, but he wasn’t a stupid betraying dickweasel fuckhead.
~
That was a challenge. It was kind of a fuck-you-Dad challenge, even though Cain didn’t use his fuck-you-Dad voice to say it.
~
Cain looked up. His voice might not show it, and his expression was still pretty neutral; but his eyes had a definite fuck-you-Dad look in them now. Sammy recognized it from all the times he’d used that same look on his own dad, and that was a lot. Dad never even bothered to notice when he used it, but Dean did. He always yelled at Sammy for it later. He said Dad totally noticed, he was just cutting Sammy some slack by not taking his head off at the kneecaps for being such a disrespectful little ree-tard for looking at him that way. Dean was totally wrong on that because Dad never cut Sammy slack for anything the way he always cut Dean slack for everything; but still, that’s what Dean always said, and he always said it when Sammy had the exact same look in his eyes that Cain had right now.
~
“I didn’t want to kill him; I just wanted to stay,” Cain said, using his full-blown fuck-you-Dad voice now. He glanced at Sammy like he actually cared whether Sammy believed him or not on that. Which Sammy didn’t. He didn’t believe either one of them as far as he could throw a freakin elephant because they were both betraying dickweasel fuckheads. 
~ Sammy’s brain snapped into high gear the moment the shifter touched Dean again. He forgot about everything he was thinking on the subject of Dad being a jackass and Dean always taking his side, or about having trouble keeping his thoughts straight instead of letting them wander all over because his head hurt so bad that thinking was actually kind of problematic right now, or about Cain being a betraying dickweasel fuckhead but it not really being all his fault so it wasn’t really fair to hate him as much as he absolutely hated him; and focused completely and solely on the fact that the shifter had hold of Dean’s jacket again, and he was done arguing with Cain about it: about saving Dean, about not killing Dean. Sammy’s heartbeat sped up until he could hardly breathe through it. He started to panic when the shifter dragged Dean off the rock again, when he realized the shifter was going to kill Dean no matter what Cain said, no matter what Cain decided. He was going to do it either way, and he’d never planned on doing anything else. Figuring that out hit Sammy in the gut like ten tons of Obvious Much? He was so stupid not to have figured that out sooner. He was so stupid to have actually believed the shifter would let Cain say no, and that would be that. He was so stupid to have believed what he wanted to believe just because he wanted to believe it so much that he just did, even when he knew it wasn’t true, even when he knew that wasn’t the way it was really going to happen.

Nightwing realizes that the little girl is trembling. He draws a deep breath. “I know,” says gently. “The costume makes me look really scary, but I promise I’m not one of the bad guys.” No point in his agonizing over which wires to cut when he can simply stop the timer. “If I’d known it was a problem, I would’ve worn my old suit. That one was all red and green and yellow. It was like dressing up like a Christmas tree.” He chuckles. The brown eyes crinkle at the corners. Her pupils contract as her breathing steadies. “Yeah,” he continues as he carefully detaches the detonator from the plastique. “Everyone else laughed too. Until I kicked their butts, anyway.”
~
“I love my show so damn much. If love were people, I would be China.”
~ Then there was finding the parking ticket to which I objected on, I don’t know, moral grounds, and I wallowed in said moral objection that the fine has now almost doubled. Suddenly I’m feeling a lot less moral and a lot more cheap, but I still have to pay the damn thing. ~ HI LJ! I FORGOT BLACK TEA HAS CAFFEINE. AND THOSE TINY CUPS STILL HOLD A LOT, WHEN YOU DRINK TWELVE OF THEM. ALSO, I HAVE NOT EATEN ENOUGH TODAY. ~ “So, yeah. Apparently I have regained sensitivity to caffeine. Good to know.” ~ “It is now eight pm, and I seem to have misplaced my weekend.” ~ “While my rhetorical and oratory skills are second to none, I’m sure, my victory was purely a result of bribing the voting panel with cake.”  ~ “The meat I made this morning was edging towards off. It tasted okay, but now we’re playing the Did Karen Give Herself Food Poisoning? game. It’s less fun than one might think.” ~ “I got a tetanus shot yesterday (no, I have not been playing on rusty railroad beds; apparently these things wear out every ten years or so; who knew?), and I was a brave little toaster overcoming needle phobia, and it didn’t hurt a bit. Yeah. That was yesterday. Today it feels like I got kicked by a horse, accompanied by a low-grade fever and mild nausea.” ~ “I’ll admit it: I would rather be punched in the face three times, hard and fast, than spend four hours being ignored by Lola’s family and making awkward, snide small talk with Lola’s friends over stale pastries.” ~ “I have discovered that my plotting style is very similar to the Underpants Gnomes. Their plan: 1. Collect underpants. 2. ? 3. Profit.”
~
“It’s a line-of-expresso-shots kind of day.”
~
If this was a romance novel, she would lean over and kiss his forehead and he would wake up and smile at her and they’d live happily ever after. Eventually, Cuddy turned to leave. “Heal quickly so I can kick your ass,” she said over her shoulder.
~
Every once in a while, House would look up from his drinking and insult their ancestry, clothing, or personal habits.
~
“Hate is an acceptably manly emotion. Being scared is more of a girly thing. Just like the difference between me and you.” He gestured at himself: “Manly.” And then at Sam: “Girly. See how that works?”
~ “Sure, he loves your chocolate chip cookies. But he eats crayons, too.”
~
He let loose a string of profanities he would have kicked Dean’s ass for indulging. Dean looked up from what he was doing, met John’s eyes. “That’s a hundred and fifty dollars to the curse kitty, Dad,” he said.
~
“Like someone shot me, then set me on fire.”
Dean’s grin widened. “Don’t blame me. I only set you on fire.”
~
“I could bring him some hot chocolate,” she offered. His grin nearly split his little face in two. He looked up at his dad expectantly, seconding the motion with an enthusiastic, “I like chocolate!”
~
He glanced at her nametag in a way that was less about her name than it was about where her nametag was pinned. His glance lingered a bit longer than it should have, then returned to her eyes with a small smile that made his show of interest a compliment in a way very few men could make looking at a woman’s chest a compliment.
~
Kelly smiled back because there really wasn’t any way for someone not to smile at the look on that kid’s face: part happy, part sweet and one hundred percent you-should-love-me-because-I-totally-love-you.
~
She could drop it; but if she did, it might hit the grill and ignite a grease fire in his face, and that wouldn’t be fair to the grease fire.
~ She gave him a weak smile intended to convey “never thought you would” but she knew probably told him “good to fucking know.”
~ “Don’t worry about the world coming to an end today. It’s already tomorrow in Australia.”
~ “Yeah, and I’m not laughing,” I told her. “Or lying. I swear I’m not lying. I got a chunk missing from my shoulder says I’m not lying.”
~ I guess I should just be glad that Molly and I had gotten to the demon moose before it had caused any real damage. 
“So, what do you think it is?” Molly ventured, after a moment.
I shrugged. “Demon moose?”
She giggled. “No, really, Harry.”
~ The demon moose chose that moment to release a bone-rattling bellow. As if on cue, one of my upstairs neighbors threw up a window, hollered, “Shut up, Dresden!” and slammed it down again.
“Yeah,” Molly said, ignoring my neighbors with the ease of long practice. “Well, at least it’s something new.”
~
“Demon moose seems to be a sufficiently descriptive name for it.”
I wandered up behind her and studied the thing. “I dunno. The antlers look a bit too spiky to be a real moose.”
“Hence, demon.” 
~
“You must have noticed,” she said, her voice suddenly high with tension, and walked away from him towards the table behind the bed. 
“Assume I’m thick,” he said, dryly, following her.
~
“I didn’t want to…” He trailed off, and shrugged, looking everywhere but at her. “I didn’t think you would… look, it doesn’t have to change anything. I can keep it to myself. I have kept it to myself. For months, now. Er.” The worried wrinkles in his forehead were back. Barbara resisted the temptation to reach up and smooth them away. Instead, she kissed him. When she’d finished, Ian was staring at her, his eyes wide again. “Oh,” he said.
~
“I’ll be able to do whatever I want,” Jack repeated with a thoughtful look. 
Sam reacted first, “Within reason…Sir.” Jack continued to look thoughtful then broke into a huge grin. 
“I’ll do it. And my first order of business will be to have Tuesday’s declared Double Fudge Brownie Day.”
~ “You misunderstand me, O’Neill. The pendant is merely the key. The gift is in orbit.”
~
“You mean you have something to tell me that’s going to be harder to swallow than the fact that we just travelled to another dimension to find the woman you were destined to love, who just happens to be another version of the cousin I lost when she was sixteen?”
~ Isaac covered the receiver with something, but Casey could still hear him threaten the lives of everyone in the control room if they didn’t quiet down. He uncovered the phone and spoke again. “I have to go fire everyone who works here, Casey, I’ll see you on Monday?”
~
Thankfully, no. All of the sketches tonight were written by actual comedy professionals -- some of the quickest, smartest writers I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. I say this mostly because they’ve written stuff which requires Casey here to put on a dress.
~ I half expected her fur to burst into flame, but it didn’t. That was a relief. A malevolent, angry hamster is unnerving enough; a malevolent, angry hamster on fire would be more than I could deal with just then.
~ Ned was far better at the sad puppy dog face than any grown man had a right to be.
~
“It looks to me like you’ve broken your clavicle,” the doctor says, running his hands over Dean’s shoulder lightly. “And it hurts like a sonuvabitch,” Dean mutters, wincing. “The good news is,” the doctor continues, either not hearing or pretending not to, “that it seems like it’s a clean break, so it’ll mend well.” “Did I mention, Dean says, louder this time, “that it hurts like a sonuvabitch?” “All we can do is wrap it for now,” the doctor says and Sam wants to give him a medal for unflappability
~
Scars meant warrior but they also often meant ‘not quite fast enough to get out of the way’.
~
The whole reason for his wishing to retire was because he had been put in charge of everything alien in the world, so no matter which branch of the AF Samantha Carter moved into he would be her commanding officer, and the frat regs meant he would not be allowed to be with her, which was a pity as they had got married two years ago, when they had a two week gap when she was in Area 51 and he was still in charge of the SGC, before his DC move.
~
“The ticket is for a Saturday,” she muses. “In the morning. Near Cosford… Which of us was driving?” (Yes, dear reader - who could it be?) “It was you,” I say. “How do you know?” “Are you serious? Of course it was you. Just conjure up a mental image of you driving the car, and then one of me driving it. Which image has speed blur?” She shifts her weight from foot to foot. “It’s not absolutely definite it was me,” she says, very, very unconvincingly indeed.
~
Margret’s manner becomes casual and easy-going. This is quite impossibly conspicuous and disconcerting; it’s like a velociraptor suddenly sitting down and starting to ice flowers onto a cake.
~ He never knew just how famous he was around the world until he went to Paris and drew attention away from the Eiffel Tower.
~ Dean and Ash had spent the last seventy-three miles coming up with the most wildly unsuitable names for her unborn child. Sam, usually the voice of reason when conversations got like this, hadn’t helped. Unless she changed her mind about ancient Greek heroes or Norse goddesses.
~
Sam didn’t mind sitting in the back, he claimed, since he couldn’t see the scenery anyhow, and Dean couldn’t reach him to give him wet willies or Indian burns. This had led to a scuffle with Dean trying to prove Sam wrong and Ash desperately grabbing the Impala’s steering wheel. 
~
All he wanted to do was yell at the man. “The trouble is that I am having convulsions, you idiot!” It struck him as an unhelpful thing to say, but the urge was overpowering.
~
“You really didn’t know?” the doctor pressed Dean, calm voice just a little accusatory.
“Seriously, doc,” Dean snapped. “You think I wouldn’t have brought my brother in sooner if I’d known he was bleeding inside?”
~
Well, whatever the verb is, I said I did it. I said it in French, English, and Russian just to be sure that everyone understood.
~
“Ooo. Did you leave anything you were particularly attached to near the pool?” 
“What? No, just that horrid polka-dot dress, why?” 
“Good then. It’s been jettisoned.” 
“The dress?” asked Martha with a slight air of glee. 
“The pool.”
~
“Wagon gave him a lift.” 
“Hunh. We got shot at,” Sam muttered. 
Smithy raised his eyebrows. “Well, you aren’t nine years old and crying your eyes out scared, now are you?”
~
“Dude, you have no idea how many times I’ve seen the ‘Back to the Future’ movies. I’m the closest thing to an expert on time travel we got.”
~
“Aw, come on! Can’t I stay?” Lee pleaded. “These guys aren’t even crazy.” 
Dean smirked. “There’s something we don’t often hear,” he murmured to Sam.
~
The voice was familiar, but Bobby couldn’t think of a soul who he’d annoyed enough to call up and shout profanities at him. At least not recently. “Sorry, Bobby, not you. Knock it off, Sam!” 
Bobby frowned. “Dean?” 
“Yeah, look, Bobby, I hate to impose but some jerk flattened my-” Another familiar voice interrupted from the background. “-didn’t do anything to your car!” 
“Shut up, I’m on the freakin’ phone and you did too!” Dean shouted. A loud clunk carried through the phone, followed by a distant and muffled, “-my damn phone, Sam!” Bobby listened intently to rustling, further thumps and general sounds of a scuffle. The background noise cleared and a strained voice came on the line. “Hi Bobby.”
~
“She’s... indescribable”
“…Two heads, flippers, seaweed for hair-”
~
The sixth rule was “Jam doesn’t go with everything.” The corollary was “No, we don’t need to try it with everything.” The seventh rule was “Finish one jar of jam before you open another.” The almost-immediate corollary was “This does not mean you can put half a cup of jam on a slice of bread and call it a sandwich in the name of finishing the jam faster.”
~ “I heard you don’t have your license.” 
“Doesn’t mean I can’t drive,” Ash sniffed, “just means the law don’t like it when I drive.” 
~
“Yeah, menacing, right. Mincing, maybe.” 
“My menacing walk strikes terror into the hearts of mortals!” 
“Bull. It looked like you’d just had a wedgie. You should work on that.” Her brother muttered something that sounded like “I am so glad I shot you,” as he stood up.
~
“Sunuvabitch, that hurt,” grunted Dean from the back seat. “Did you have a-” A large pale semi barreled through the intersection, no hint of slowing down.”-okay, that would be a yes to the vision, then.” Dean hissed weakly. “You see speed traps too?”
~
The words were pathetic enough. The look that accompanied it? Abused orphan puppies needing a new home had nothing on his little brother.
~ Dean shrugs off his bag and his coat but keeps on his boots in case whatever it is John’s doing with buckets of gas explodes and he has to make a run for it. Not that he thinks he could outrun the potential fireball, but it’s still some comfort. And his dad is good with explosives, except for that one time with the nitrogen triiodine, but John had detonated that on himself on purpose.
~ “I wonder if the government thinks you’re a terrorist,” Dean says, and now John grins as he stirs.  He says, “Do you remember when Sam asked me that? Back when he was ten, and I was making Molotov cocktails?”
~
Like when your father was making napalm in the bathroom sink…”I guess if this were soup this would be the point where I tasted it,” he says, and leans over the sink. “Wow. That’s an incredibly bad idea,” Dean deadpans.
~
“You goin’ after it alone, John?” Bobby asked, allowing the warning in his voice to show, and that was the first time he caught anything from the kid. Just a flicker across the stoic face that let Bobby knew he and the kid were on exactly the same page, the one that read anybody who went up against an unknown something that could set people on fire by himself was a plain fool.
~ “I’m not as worried about the boys’ behavior as I am about the fact that I live in the middle of five square acres of tetanus waiting to happen,” Bobby grumbled, looking across the scrap yard.
~
Bobby was being buffeted by his own furniture and books, but it wasn’t the first time. He dodged a chunk of firewood, but just kept chanting.
~
“You can totally tell what kind of place it’s going to be by all the crap they sell along the road when you first come in the state.” “Is this some Sam Winchester grand unified theory of the highway or something?” Dean asked, amused despite himself. “Sure,” Sam said, leaning back in his seat and launching into lecture mode. “For example, Wisconsin has porn, fireworks and cheese. So, pretty decent place overall. You can get laid, blow things up and eat. It says “welcome traveler.” Illinois, all about the porn and casinos, so go there for dirty fun, I guess. Michigan is strangely eclectic, because, you see right there, it’s porn, but up the road we’re going to start seeing u-pick orchard signs and wine tasting. Ohio has porn and Tom Raper’s RV, and I’m not sure what that actually means other than people want to leave Ohio and get laid.” “If you’re on highway 10,” Dean said. “The tollway just has porn.” “Right. And in Indiana, you just have fireworks, no porn, no cheese, no nothing. I’m figuring the fireworks exist because everyone here wants to blow themselves up.”
~ “So you can just shut your cake hole or bite me. Your choice.” Sam looked at Dean like he was sizing up Dean’s jugular and Dean was caught somewhere between admiration for the effectiveness of Sam’s bite plan and being totally creeped out
~
He drove on in silence, cursing the line of idiots ahead of him on the two-lane who obviously had nowhere to be if driving 43 in a 55 mph zone meant anything at all.
~
“I kind of wish I’d brought the rifle, because, seriously, this level of stupidity is worthy of some nice, clean headshots and not a lot of argument. We’d just be cleanin’ pee out of the gene pool at this point.”
~
“Hi!” Dean said pleasantly, leveling his shotgun at the belly of the dude with the athame. “Drop the knife or I’ll kill you.”
~
“Do you not speaka the Engleesh?” Dean asked again, in that super shiny pleasant voice hoping that maybe if they thought he was psycho enough, they’d listen. “Drop the knife! Now!”
~
The left-over firecrackers in Johannsen’s barn had proved too much to resist. It was mostly John’s fault, anyway, because he was the one who’d taught the boys how to handle firearms, how to load shotguns and mix gunpowder with silver and salt. Jim had seen Dean field-strip and reassemble a rifle in less than two minutes. While blindfolded. It was Dean who had masterminded what Jim was already calling The Great Fifth of July Firecracker Fiasco of ‘95. The boys had emptied out various shotgun shell casings and mixed the gunpowder with the firecrackers they’d liberated from the apparently unlocked barn, then set the whole lot off out in the back field behind the church. During evening service. The resultant explosion had been quite spectacular, taking out several feet of perimeter fencing, as well as the small shed where the ancient lawnmower had resided. To be honest, Jim hadn’t minded so much; he’d been delivering a particularly juicy hellfire and damnation sermon and the pyrotechnics had come at a critical juncture in the address. It had certainly been highly effective in dispelling any doubts some of his congregation might have had concerning the existence of the Almighty.
~
Sammy Winchester is a theologian’s nightmare. A couple of weeks ago he’d asked casually where God’s Mommy was, then followed that up with a detailed inquisition on who was older; God, Santa Claus or Abraham Lincoln. Sammy had figured Santa Claus, because his beard was the whitest, and Jim still wasn’t sure if he’d managed to talk him out of that particular blasphemy.
~ “So, there are how many skies in this song?” Jim decides to go with the flow, and hope that at some point in the future it will all make sense. Or that he will learn to embrace the lunacy.  “Four.” Sammy helpfully holds up the relevant number of fingers.  “Four skies,” Jim muses, trying desperately to remember a nursery rhyme, lullaby or even a hymn with mentions of a four-skied world where heavenly produce is transported from on high by specially-chartered airplanes. He fails spectacularly.
~
They haven’t invented words colorful enough to describe this annoying piece of shit.
~
And the guy says back, “You’re beautiful.  Do you know that?”
Yeah, Dean knows it.  The life they lead doesn’t give him much time to worry about his looks – and Dad and Sam sure wouldn’t put up with it if he tried – but he gets immediate attention from women almost everywhere he goes, so he figures, yeah, he was in the right line when they passed out “good-looking.” 
~
“Are you gonna tell my dad about Henry?”
“You mean during the four minutes before Sam blurts it out?”
~
“This your car?” Doug asks.
“No,” says the owner of the sneakers.  “I’m trying to steal the engine and then tunnel out of here.”
~
It’s a good thing because if he was an inch closer to being conscious, his brain would start telling him he feels like crap on buttered toast
~ Dean’s face was scrunched into something that would have been hilarious on a Halloween jack-o-lantern
~ “We’re going down to the cafeteria and get something to eat.  Maybe when we come back, she’ll be awake and you can babble weird shit at her like you did out in the hall.  Then we’ll go stare at your kid some more.  Or you can stare, while I go find somebody to club you over the head so you can get some sleep.  ‘Cause if I did it?  That’d be rude.  Being that I’m an uncle now, and I should act…you know.  Like a good example.”
~ Dad was a freaking nutjob who didn’t let injury slow him down simply because he refused to acknowledge the fact that he was wounded.  Dean, on the other hand, was perfectly willing to admit his left ankle hurt like the unholy fires of the hell he’d managed not to get dragged down to fifteen years ago.
~ A little input from Sam would’ve been helpful, but Sam had gone out like a light a good half hour ago.  Sam, who’d been like the Princess and the friggin’ Pea when he was a kid, always yapping about squeaky box springs or lumpy mattresses, and God help you if you asked him to sleep on the ground, had somehow – and fairly recently, as near as Dean could figure – developed the ability to sleep anywhere.  Any-no-exceptions-where.  Make him horizontal for more than five minutes and he was out cold. So there Sam was, stretched out on his side on a patch of ground lumpier than a gravel driveway a couple yards from the fire, one arm stuck under his head for a pillow, cutting some serious Z’s. Like he had a nice hearty dinner in his belly and had the prospect of a stroll on the beach to look forward to in the morning instead of a ten-mile hike back to the car through underbrush and poison ivy and rocks and chuckholes, because nobody had seen fit to offer anything as useful as, say, a road up to freaking wendigo-land.
~
“I cried like a girl.  Morphine?  Tell you, man, I freakin’ love morphine.” 
~
“Spoils the image, huh?  Can’t be the scourge of evil and have people say, ‘Oh, yeah, him?  I fuckin’ love the guy.’”
~
“Then maybe…can you fill me in on what variety of nothing we’re talking about?”
“The nothing variety of nothing,” Dean told him.  “Go back to sleep.”
~
“You don’t make him wear an apron, do you?”
“It’s pink and has kittens on it.”
~ “Research it? Where? Strange happenings dot com? I’m going crazy dot net?” Dean waved his hand in the air. “We’re seeing us, but we’re not here.”
~
“Say it.” Sam chanted, drawing the syllables out.  “No way.”
“Dean.” Sam was all maddening calm and gleeful little-brother smirk. “It’s the rule.” Dean huffed but couldn’t deny it. After all—it had been his rule. “Sam is Supreme Ruler of the Court. I bow before his superior skills.”
~ “What I remember you seeing,” Dad said, low, while he turned the tiny curved needle in his gigantic fingers, “was the palm of my hand, since I covered your eyes so you wouldn’t see.”
~ With Dean’s luck, he’d get Tucker Marcus, that creepy-ass pale dude who probably worshiped Satan and sacrificed babies in his spare time.
~ “Oh, that’s perfect,” Dean groans, examining the pieces of the coffee machine as if it were some kind of alien technology. “All we need to do is put up a big sign that says please tip hat to swamp creature. Case closed.”
~ It was a remarkably eloquent shrug, somehow managing to convey I hate my brother, adults are stupid, life sucks and nobody understands me in a single quick lift and drop of the shoulders.
~ Dean was wearing that smile, the one that meant illegal activities, a high likelihood of Sam getting splattered with monster gunk, and a fifty percent chance of some kind of explosives.
~ “Fine. Cold, wet, and contemplating ways to kill you in various painful ways, but otherwise, I’m peachy!”
~ When the big blue box faded into view a few yards away, Dean blinked. He had never seen a police call box in his life, but he could tell this was one because it said “Police Public Call Box” right over the door. Not that he had time to worry about police call boxes that appeared out of nowhere, because, hello, demons.
~
“He trapped us in his sarcophagus. Now tell me how this could be worse? No, don’t answer that. God, why do I listen to you? ‘Hey, Sammy, know what’d be fun? Let’s go taunt the oldest, meanest ghost we can find. Maybe he’ll give us cookies!’” “I did not taunt the ghost.” “You did; I heard you. You were goading it.” “I was distracting it so you could reload. Which you took your sweet time doing...” “This is my fault now?”
~ “You’ve seen dragons?” “Seen, killed, got the T-shirt.” “Got the T-shirt burnt right off your back, you mean.”
~
“I am seriously beginning to hate this guy,” Dean said, and kicked the wall in frustration. “He’s like a mime from hell.”
~ He moved his gun from his waistband to a side pocket of his pack, leaving it mostly unzippered for easy retrieval. Putting on a relaxed, I’m-a-totally-harmless-and-not-at-all-creepy-stranger face, he stepped out into the glow of the sunset.
~
“I’ve been tied up on a beach like fucking Gulliver, is where I’ve been.”  “What?”  “Elves. Goddamned little bitty green elves.” He eased stiffly down onto a fallen tree at the forest’s edge, dropped the bundled pack at his feet and massaged his aching temples. “They drugged me and tied me up and tried to eat my toes.”  “What?”  “Elves, Sam. Elves!” How difficult was this to understand? “That’s what we’re fucking dealing with here. Motherfucking elves.”
~ “Okay. But we’ve dealt with old gods before. Find her source of power and…” Sam shook his head. “She was the goddess of winter. The source of her power is winter, Dean.”
~ “Ghosts are a rational explanation,” Dean said in what Sam thought was supposed to be a comforting tone. “Just not one most people expect.” Sam resisted the urge to roll his eyes. As a therapist, Dean made a great ghost hunter.
~
“It’s the assistant’s job to carry the bags. Although, next time, I want my assistant to be blonde and curvy, if you know what I mean.” Sam rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I bet Pamela Anderson is a whole lot of help when it comes to getting rid of ghosts. And if I’m your assistant, I want a raise and dental, at the very least.” Dean sighed deeply as he tried out the keys on the door lock. “I bet Pam wouldn’t be this much trouble. She’d want more interesting fringe benefits, too.” He wiggled his eyebrows to make sure Sam got his meaning.
~
“How do you think the Fosters are going to feel about us demolishing part of their wall?” “Better than they feel about having ghosts, if I’m right.” “And if you’re wrong, we’ll totally say the ghosts did it.”
~ Sam was working that soft, self-effacing smile that drove Dean batshit crazy but apparently convinced the rest of the world that his little brother was as harmless as a puppy dog and absolutely trustworthy.
~ This time, the authority figure in question responded to the truth by dragging a kitchen chair into the living room, getting comfortable, and saying, “Okay. I’m listening.” Dean eyed the guy suspiciously. “Are you sure you’re FBI?”
~
“You saw him die in a vision?” The way she said ‘vision’ suggested many things, starting with ‘sicko stalker fantasy’ and going downhill from there.
~
Scully gave him a look that promised she could make him and Sam vanish without a trace if their explanation wasn’t convincing enough, and Dean wondered how hard she would kick his ass if he told her she was sexy when she glared.
~ She didn’t so much put herself between her partner and Dean and Sam, as forecast bloody death with the forward slide of a tiny, slim foot.
~ The beach was fenced off, with ‘No Trespassing’ and ‘Dangerous Undertow’ signs posted every couple feet. Sam, still wearing his buzzkill face, pointed at the signs as he got out of the car. “This cannot end well, Dean.”
~ Dean had crested the hill and vanished, too, all in the time it had taken Sam to say “oh, wait, maybe I’m not okay” and sit back down very hard in the snow. Although, he may not have said it out loud. Shoving to his feet with the intent to follow Dean after the Yeti, the first thing he’d noticed was a sudden lack of being able to breathe, followed by a lot of pain and a lack of being able to remain standing up. With all of that going on, it was possible he’d only managed to think the words.
~ Sam knew Dean would be fine taking on the Yeti alone, partly because they’d managed to shoot it full of a shitload of silver before it tossed Sam into the tree and ran off, but mostly because Dean could pretty much take on anything alone.
~ The only thing that made him feel the least bit better about the fact that he was sprawled on his ass under a tree instead of backing up his brother like he’d said he would was the fact that he didn’t exactly have much to offer the fight at this point anyway, other than possibly distracting the Yeti by falling down a lot. He stared at the snow, and got lost in thought. Normally at a time like this, he’d be thinking that if he was supposed to have Dean’s back then he should get off his ass and find Dean, regardless of how much falling down he had to do to get there. But thinking was hard.
~ The...skeleton, the thing, whatever it was, had set aside its charcoal and was looking at him curiously. Or possibly politely. Sam really couldn’t tell; its facial expressions ranged from ominously grinning, to ominously grinning with head tilted, and were really no help at all.
~ Upset. Because, blood. His brain stuttered to a stop in the face of the skeleton’s undivided attention, so his mouth said the first thing that came to it. “I’m not supposed to get my cast wet.” They stared at each other for a moment. AH, it said eventually. It tore the kitten-and-yarn picture from the sketchpad and set it beside the scythe on the snow, saying, I THOUGHT PERHAPS THE DEEP GASHES IN YOUR ABDOMEN WERE CAUSING YOU SOME CONCERN. I WAS MISTAKEN. It set to sketching a new picture, and Sam spent several minutes being very glad to be ignored again before thinking, wait.
~ Sam gritted his teeth again and pressed his arm against his side, and commanded his brain to start processing. ‘Could have been worse’? What did that even mean? Because coming from something that may or may not be a reaper, that may or may not be an extremely loaded statement. Even if it was a reaper, it had so far forgone reaping him in favor of drawing kittens, and he should really just continue to let it do that, rather than drawing attention to its purpose.
~
“My brother is going to be pissed at me if I die.” Among other things. The thought made it hard to breathe again. Or maybe that was still the broken ribs.
PERHAPS HE WILL UNDERSTAND. Sam considered how well his brother tended to accept death when it happened to someone other than Dean himself. “No, he won’t.” Sam hugged himself tightly and clung to the pain. “You don’t know Dean.” ACTUALLY, I HAVE NEARLY MET HIM SEVERAL TIMES, it said. HOWEVER, I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HUMAN INTERACTION, AND HAVE FOUND THAT IN THESE SITUATIONS ONE IS EXPECTED TO OFFER FALSE PLATITUDES. It glanced at him. IS THAT NOT CORRECT? Sam blinked. “Uh. Well, no. I mean, yes. I guess.” Was he giving a reaper advice on social interaction? “Some people do appreciate well-meaning, er, lies. Platitudes.”
~
“You son of a bitch. You goddamned son of a bitch. I left you here, Sam, I didn’t check to make sure you were okay, and you could have bled to death, or frozen to death, or – Jesus Christ, Sammy, you son of a bitch.” Dean cussed him out under his breath all the way to the car. By the time they got there, Sam was torn between wanting his brother to stop freaking out and start joking around like he usually did, and feeling very, very loved.
~ At the house, after they’d watched the woman melt into the floor, Sam said, “You think mom loved us like that?”
“Do I think Mom loved us enough to kill us because Dad cheated on her?” Dean asked, confused.
~ You sigh. You don’t mean to, but you can’t help it. “I’m not really his sister, you know?” “I know.” “Or his girlfriend, wife or lover.” “It doesn’t really matter for my purposes.” “Yeah, I sort of figured.” “You’re taking this better than I expected.” “Would crying let me live any longer?” “No. Not really.” You shrug. “Well, there you go then.” ~ Sammy immediately started his favourite game of throwing all of his toys out of the pen and making Dean fetch them back.
~
“We need to go to ground, get you out of the limelight.” “Why do they call it that?” “Call it what?” “Limelight. Why not cherry light or orange light?” “Oh brother.” “Or how about chocolate light.” “Okay, Brainiac, get your ass onto the fire escape.” Sam snickered. “But Dean, I don’t think my donkey will fit.”
~
“Charlie Zeta Five,” his mom said in a harsh voice. Dean couldn’t help the sneer that appeared on his face, but when he looked at the terminator he found the same look returned. “Yeah, Charlie Zeta Five,” it taunted. Dean actually found the breath to chuckle. He looked straight at the terminator as he recited the code. “Sierra Xray Delta Two Five One Banana Fanana Deo Eclipse Two. Bitch,” he added for spite.
~ “Well, let’s see, I lost all of my M&Ms and Skittles, over half of my Lara Doones and most of the chocolate filled tube cookies that Dean likes so much. In addition, Sam gets to spend all day Saturday by himself in the attic and Dean gets the next three batches of sweets brought over by parishioners. I’m also supposed to hint to Mrs. Jacobson that I’d really like to have her death by chocolate cake this week”  John made a big production of looking beneath the table. “Have you seen my dignity lying around somewhere? Or did I lose that as well?”
~ He’s not even sure that Dean knows he’s in a war just yet, and in Sam’s book, that means Sam’s already on the road to winning.
~ “The goddamn undead possessed yak was chasing me around the house for like, 20 minutes before you even got here!”
~ Sam’s actually not that difficult to read, as a yak. (As a yak, Dean’s brain reiterates somewhat hysterically, and not at all helpfully.)
~ That’s how it always went. Dean got insistent, and people threatened to call security. Sam got insistent, and everyone fell over themselves trying to help.
~ “You fought an aswang,” Sam said in a tight voice Dean remembered all too well. It was the voice he’d used to conjugate Latin verbs for Dad when what he’d really wanted was to be doing his algebra homework. “I know that because Bobby told me. You made enough of a racket that somebody called the cops, who showed up to find you bleeding out on the sidewalk. I know that because a friend in the police department told me. I know that the doctors think you were attacked by some sort of wild animal, that you have twenty-seven stitches in your abdomen and twelve more in your hip, and there’s a simple fracture in your right collarbone. I know that because Dr. Sanchez told me. I know you were unconscious for three days, which nobody had to tell me because I was here the whole goddamn time. Notice how--”  Sam stopped, caught his breath, bit his lip and turned away for a few seconds so Dean couldn’t see his face. He slumped low in his borrowed chair and folded his arms across his chest. “Notice how there’s not a single thing I can say I know because you told me.”
~ He looked worried and annoyed in equal parts, which was pretty much his normal “Dean drops by” look.
~
Dean really didn’t want to find out if “immortal and dismembered” was something he could come back from.
~
“A pact?” Dean raised one eyebrow at him. “What are you, nine? You wanna pinky-swear, too?” Sam silently held out his right fist with the little finger sticking out.
~ “Goddamn idiot kids,” Dean grumbled to himself as he uncapped a bottle of Oban with his teeth. “It’s the solstice! Let’s all hang out at the cemetery and animate the dead! Why the fuck does anyone ever think that’s a good idea?”
~ “Who the fuck are you?” the guy demanded. The gun didn’t waver. “Someone who clearly knows more about killing zombies than you do,” Dean told him pointedly. “Bullets bad. Fire and beheading good. Now would you mind pointing that thing somewhere else? It’s making me twitchy.”
~ “Dean, if I said anything like that to you, you’d call me a giant sappy girl.” “That’s because you are a giant sappy girl.” “And you are...” “A tough, kick-ass dude with hidden depths.”
~ The last time they’d had to fly, Sam had smirked at him, mocked him for humming Metallica and ragged on him for panicking and making himself susceptible to demonic possession. It had irritated Dean just enough to take the edge of his panic, which he’d considered a fair exchange. This time around, though, Sam had been infinitely worse. This time he had been sympathetic. This time he had fussed over Dean’s seat belt (because a lap belt was going to be so much help if they fell out of the sky in a giant flaming fireball), and patted his shoulder every few minutes, and even bought him a teeny little bottle of JD from one of the flight attendants (Dean would’ve needed about fifty of those to make him forget the fact that he was in danger of falling out of the sky in a giant flaming fireball). For six straight hours, every time Dean started to relax a little, he would catch a glimpse of Sam in his peripheral vision, watching Dean with big, worried eyes, and all of Dean’s hard-won calm would fly right out the window. In a giant flaming fireball.
~ “I swear to God,” he muttered while Dean smeared the stuff on his lobster-pink arms and face, “you’re like a vampire or something. Here, I got you a hat, too.” He might’ve said “I got you a bucket of dead cockroaches,” given the way Dean glared at him.
~ “I’ve learned that this ship has a displacement of 2957 tons, two 1400-horsepower General Electric propulsion engines and a maximum speed of fourteen knots. If I wanted to, I could also give you the daily fuel consumption, the water capacity, the area of each deck in square feet and a detailed description of the sewage system.” “But you won’t,” Sam said quickly, “because you’re my brother and you love me, right?”
~ Sam gave him a quick, wry grin. “Well, if our luck runs the way it normally does, I figure we’ll know it when it tries to kill us.” Dean couldn’t really argue with that.
~ Sam yelled at them to stay inside. Dean just swore at them, which probably translated to the same thing.
~ That stupid orange vest Sam had made him put on saved his life. Dean really wasn’t looking forward to the inevitable I-told-you-sos, but there was no denying the obvious truth after he woke up floating face up in the middle of the freaking Pacific. It was actually the third time he’d woken up, or at least the third that he actually remembered. The first time was a brief burst of flailing panic, gone so quickly Dean still wasn’t sure that he hadn’t hallucinated it. The second time lasted just long enough for him to register details like dark and head hurts and water before fading out again. Now the third time was apparently the charm, if you defined “charm” as “staying conscious long enough to figure out exactly how screwed you are.”
~ John gave her his most charming smile, the one that made lady cops tear up speeding tickets and inspired waitresses in truck stops to forget to charge him for his coffee.
~ “Oh,” Mom said in her calm, inside-I’m-screaming voice.
~ “Dean’s a natural, can hit a target straight on in the dark, blindfolded, and in a blizzard.” The way he said it made Jerry wonder if Dean had ever had to hit a target while blindfolded at night during a blizzard.
~ The jukebox began playing “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.” The song died with a bang as Dean shot the jukebox. “Thank you,” three voices chorused.
~
It was a pretty big rock, as far as rocks go, not that Dean was an expert on rocks, or anything like that. Really it was more like an island. There was even a small patch of dirt, bushes, and a spindly tree at one end. Then he decided he was kidding himself. It was a rock, a rock in the middle of a whole lot of water.
~
Dean turned a glare on him, but he doubted his brother could see it in the dark. “No, Sam, I haven’t thought of anything yet. When I do think of something, you can count on it, you’ll be the second person to know. And you can stop laughing now.”
~
“I hate zombies,” Sam muttered. “Which is good, because the zombies hate you,” said Dean, sliding another shell into his shotgun. “Zombies hate everyone. Hence the chasing, rending, and eating. You’re alive, so the zombies hate you.”
~ “Right. They can’t be zombies, because zombies don’t exist.” Dean waved towards the window. “How about you go down there, and tell them that they don’t exist? Just to see what they do. I’ll make sure you get some nice flowers after I’m forced to shoot you in the head.”
~ “Maybe they’re not actually violent,” said Sam. “They ate the hitch-hiker. We saw them.” “Maybe they aren’t hungry anymore.” “They’re zombies.”
~ Sam wasn’t in the habit of starting the day by making lists of things not to do. It seemed counter-productive, and also a little too time-consuming for his tastes, since there were several million things he didn’t intend to do on any given day. ‘Die’ topped the list, but ‘join the Republican party’, ‘write a volume of best-selling poetry’, and ‘watch sitcom television’ were all on there. ‘Photosynthesize’ and ‘undergo metamorphosis’ had both been added to the list over the years. Now, and with very little warning or time to prepare, he was forced to add ‘riding a tractor away from an abandoned farmhouse in order to play distraction for a horde of zombies which technically doesn’t exist, but wants to eat me anyway’. On the plus side, it seemed to be working; the zombies, attracted to motion and the heat of the tractor’s engine, were actually following him, and while the tractor was never going to win the Indy 500, it was still fast enough to be the clear winner in the first annual Sam Doesn’t Get Eaten By Zombies marathon.
~ “Are you crazy?!” “Yes! Jump!” Stay in the tractor and get pulled apart by zombies, or jump onto the moving muscle-car being driven by the man who, if he wasn’t Sam’s brother, Sam probably wouldn’t have trusted behind the wheel of anything that didn’t run on a fixed track? The fact that this wasn’t a hard decision was slightly worrisome. Sam jumped.
~
“Not my fault if some kind of mutant freak thing escaped from a lab somewhere.” “I assume you’re referring to the monster, not me?” “You’re gonna die wondering.”
~ ‘Dude, lets call the police and…’ Dean started but then Belle said, ‘No police,’ and set fire to the small patch of ground in front of them. Sam and Dean stared at it, then her, then each other. Dean just shrugged. ‘What do we do now? Hand her over to the police anyway?’ She set fire to their feet this time and both boys jumped back to a safe distance. She glowered at them, tears and fire burning not just in her fingertips but in the depths of her irises too.
~
“Where the heck have you been? I’ve been here, entertaining a five year old witch, I may add, which isn’t easy cause if she doesn’t like the game she sets fire to your feet, and man, she’s got a lot of energy. You’ve been gone forever.”
~ She smiled and conjured a flower into his coffee cup. Dean frowned and pulled it out, and when Sam laughed he shoved it up Sam’s nose. They fought over that for a while, something Belle found hilarious and tried to join in on. She pulled Sam’s hair and poked Dean in the eye and eventually they just gave up, because her tiny jabbing fingers were far too successful at causing pain.
~
“Listen, are you allowed to get mail here?” “Yeah, but they’re pretty hip to the whole cake-with-a-file thing.” “Frankie, if I baked a cake, that would be the weapon.”
~ “The church used to make me feel safe, too,” Jim noted. “Then Meg walked in and cut my throat. Feels a little less safe now.”
~
“Hell, no. Wouldn’t want to give you a stroke or anything.”
“I’m dead, Dean,” Jim reminded him.
“Wouldn’t want to give you an electromagnetic spike or anything,” Dean adjusted easily.
“I’ve heard my share of sins over the years.”
“Not like mine. I’m creative.”
“And prolific,” Jim agreed.
“What? You’ve been counting?”
“We use your sin clock as a fan in the Big Guy’s office.”
~
“That’s the way it works on TV,” Dean said.
Jim smiled. “Well absolutely then: that must be the way it works in real life.”
~
“Wendigo don’t migrate.” Dean says it with a sort of desperate certainty, like he really doesn’t want to be wrong.
“Yeah, you want to go tell that to them? They’re migrating.”
~ “Yeah, sure, I worry about you.” Dean peers back into the sink. “I worry about you when you don’t eat, I worry about you when you don’t sleep, I worry about you when vampires try to cut your head off.”
~ “I’m... um, I’m going to make Mike some tea, and heat up some chicken broth,” Coreen says nervously in the ensuing silence.
“I hate tea.” Mike says weakly, unable to think clearly enough to come up with anything more useful.
“I don’t care. You’re going to drink the damn tea.” Vicki snaps, and Mike isn’t really willing to argue with her.
~
He woke up blinking at the dried blood. Yes, there she was, staring right at him. “Do I have your attention, Mr. Reynolds?” Mal grunted, which seemed to be sufficient. “Are you still insisting that you have no idea where the artifact is, or the woman who gave it to you?” “I ain’t exactly had a chance to go looking since the last time you asked me,” he pointed out.
~
“These part of the plan?” Dean asks. He doesn’t exactly remember that part of things; in fact, he has a pretty clear memory of the phrase “no explosives” being used more than once.
~ He raises an eyebrow at Sam, waiting for an explanation regarding Julia’s presence in their suite. Sam doesn’t know the secret eyebrow language for she’s demented and thinks she’s my wife, but some of his frustration must shine through, because Dean suddenly relaxes and gets that oh, this is going to be good look on his face.
~
“I don’t remember that,” he admitted, trying to let her know why he did that.
Rae turned to give him an odd look. “Yeah, well, you get knocked out a lot.”
~
“Let me pass,” the thing snarled, tucking its head down into its meaty shoulders and drooling at him.  Its eyes were red and crazed, and its teeth were bigger than Sam’s head.
“Why?” Sam said lazily, and yawned, licking his chops.
A head larger than Sam’s whole body swung back and forth, as if the question was puzzling. “I have been summoned?” it attempted, sounding unsure.
“Have you?’ Sam tilted his head.  There was a deafening crack the shotgun, but the bullet passed over him and didn’t even seem to impact the hound. “Why?” It shuffled to one side, like it was trying to edge out of sight, but Sam pinned it with a level glare.  It wasn’t really present in reality yet, but neither was it able to retreat back into hell.  It was in-between until Sam allowed it to pass.
“Don’t know,” it grumbled at last.  “Mayhem, usually.  Tearing people up.  Revenge.” It sat down, settling its eight-foot-long body on the ground and propping its head on its paws. “Boring.”
Sam gave a cat-grin, stretching his jaws wide, eye narrowing to slits.  “Then why do you want to pass?” There was a long silence.  This was genius-level thinking for a hellhound, whose primary reason for existence was to turn living creatures into tiny lumps of bloody flesh and then drag the souls back to hell. The scorched brow wrinkled, the reddened eyes narrowed, and it looked conflicted.
“I… don’t?” it said at last, and Sam nodded regally.
“Back you go, then,” he said, and shoved with all his psychic might.
~
Dean had set to with his usual aplomb, tipping the altar over, growling threats and insults at the small, nervous man and setting things on fire to see if they would burn. 
~
Dean even swore up and down that “This time – in British Columbia, Sammy, you shoulda been there, it was awesome!” that he and their dad had dealt with a flock of demonically possessed sheep. Sam wondered what kind of damage a bunch of herbivores could do, bleat you to death?  Throw their soft, woolly bodies at you until you suffocated? 
~
He ran his hand over the carvings one last time, grimacing as his fingers came away with a light coating of yellow crystals. Sulphur had been embedded in all the cracks, like a particularly persistent dust. “Stop fondling the evil cupboard, Sam, and let’s get this over with.” Dean’s voice was clipped and slightly more than irritated.  It seemed he felt demonic furniture was somehow beneath him. 
~ “Ever hear anything when you pray?” he meant to be teasing, but the question came out more seriously than he intended, almost – wistful.
Sam smiled, a tiny, secret smile. ”Sure.” Dean looked at him for the first time during the conversation, startled. ”The voices telling me to shave your head and paint you purple. I don’t think that’s God, though, so I don’t listen.”
~
“They’re thinking about cutting you off,” Sam commented.
Dean snorted at that.  “I can hold my liquor, Sammy.”
“Yours and several other people’s.”
~
This phone is fragile, Sam told himself.  This phone will break if you throw it against the wall.  Or into the pool.  Or run over it with the car. Anything to make Dean’s voice stop coming out of the damn thing.
~ It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important.-M.L.K.
~
“He convinced a pair of guards that they had to escort us to the pier so we could board a ship. Since they’d specifically been told to keep us in the building and shoot us if we tried to leave, I found that pretty damned impressive.”
~ “I said we don’t want to hurt you, not that we won’t.”
“Shockingly, I figured that out,” Daniel growled
~ “Anything you want to talk about?” Dean asked carefully.
“I was going for silent and brooding,” Sam replied, “but thanks.”
“Sorry. Hard to tell the difference from the normal gloomy quiet thing you’ve got going on.” Sam glared and Dean grinned. “Right. Forgot to mention the glaring.”
“I save the glaring for special occasions.”
Dean snorted. “Right. Like when you’re…. breathing… or talking. You like it for lecturing, too. Did I mention breathing?”
~ “So what do we do?” Sam asked.
“You distract them and I’ll steal her purse,” Dean suggested.
~
“Yeah, but I can’t yell back. Yelling at an old lady is like yelling at a nun. You just don’t do it.”
“Dean, you have yelled at a nun.”
“Dude, she was a novice… or whatever you call it. A pre-nun. And she was evil. That doesn’t count.”
~ Sam came out of the bathroom looking like something that had been attacked by a rabid badger.
~ “Answer something and don’t be flippant.”
“I don’t know what that means, but I’m too tired to be it, whatever it is.”
“Means don’t be a smartass.”
“Well, then I’m almost too tired.”
~
“Sure. Cause showing up and finding out she has a husband and two kids would be so soothing in my last days.”
“It might,” Sam replied simply, “to know that she’s happy.”
“And if she’s unhappy?”
“Than we kick whoever’s ass is making her unhappy.”
~
“But you weren’t even with us for a year when you disappeared.”
“That’s because I died! Thanks for noticing!” Crystal Ball snapped.
“You know I wondered what happened to you,” Cobra Commander scratched his head.
“I shall tell you the tale of my demise,” Crystal Ball said in a melodramatic voice. “A tale of horror and woe!”
“Look I said I wondered,” Cobra Commander held up his hand. “I didn’t say I cared.”
~ “No,” she assured him cheerfully, “I’m perfectly sane. The pink Hippogriff on my shoulder always tells me so.”
~ Daniel felt something nudge his leg and rolled over, blinking sleepily at the slightly blurry figure. It wasn’t Jack, he could see that much. Jack almost never pointed guns at him.
~ “You have five children, eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter; don’t you think it’s time you grew up?”
~
“I didn’t pass out,” Dean protested automatically. At Sam’s glower, he sulkily added, “I was resting.”
~ The young boy squinted up at the small square of paper that was being thrust out for him to read, then raised an unimpressed eyebrow. ‘Your badge is a plain bit of paper,’ he told the policeman helpfully.
~
“Doctor, you wouldn’t happen to be in Rose’s bed, would you?”
“Absolutely not,” a muffled voice informs her, and the pillow moves ever so slightly. “I’m fixing the internal gravitical anomaly stabiliser in the kitchen.”
~
“It’s usually how things work around here. You start off thinking they are just a lot of nasty but unrelated incidents, and then you discover that they’re all connected, somehow – usually about a week before the apocalypse.”
~
“Sorry, I don’t think we’ve met…?”
“You destroyed my sisters!”
“Did I? Oh dear, there I go crossing my own timeline again—”
~
And he didn’t judge her when it turned out she was the worst pseudo-parent ever and had inadvertently raised a criminal mastermind.
~
Sam sighs. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”
Dean grins “Yeah, Brain, but where are we going to get two tons of banana pudding and a giant tricycle?”
~
“Just once!” Dean said, angrily getting to his feet, “just once, could somebody freakin’ stay dead!”
~ He looked genuinely surprised. “Seriously? You’ve lost faith? After all that? Man, if that ain’t irony …” He let out a low whistle.
Sam scowled. “Were we even at the same farmhouse?” he sniped.
~
“I don’t know how you and your happy-go-lucky sociopathic reprobate of a brother got out of the pit in Hell that was undoubtedly reserved for you, but so help me God, I’ll summon those hellhounds and watch them drag you both back down there by the ankles!”
“For that, you can walk back to town.” As they climbed in the car, she heard him say, “Am I a happy-go-lucky sociopathic reprobate?”
“Only on Thursdays,” Sam shrugged. “But then, not even Dad ever got the hang of Thursdays.”
~
“No, I didn’t ask what they were doing…because I like my kneecaps, that’s why…”
~
Martha drew herself up a little straighter, infusing her voice with all the dignity she could muster. “I assume that your tone indicates your own horror at missing out on the awesomeness that is me, and is not, in fact, an indication of your shock that I could attract a male of my own species and be in a long-term relationship?” “Er...” The Doctor thought about that one. He was almost certain that if he chose option two something very unpleasant would happen to him next time he visited Earth. He did not want unpleasant things to happen to him. Especially not at the hands of Martha Jones. She had very pointy nails, after all. “Quite. Exactly. I’m devastated. I was hoping you’d consider bearing my time babies.”
~
“A brilliant suggestion. Rose Tyler, do I ever tell you you’re a genius?”
Rose grins through the gloom. “Not often enough.”
“Well, remind me to. At – “ he checks his watch “ – 2.32am, every morning, I’m going to tell you exactly that. Every morning without fail. Rose Tyler, you’re a genius. See? It’s officially your genius minute. Of course, you can still be a genius at any other – “
~
“I hate being a girl! You always have to remember all these rules and look pretty all the time and you have to make everything look effortless even though it’s hard to walk around all day in high heels and when boys look at you you’re not allowed to be disgusted and I’m scared of getting my period because everyone says it’ll hurt so bad and you’re not here and I just want to come home.”
Dean says nothing. Then, “What boys were looking at you? I’m gonna kick their asses.”
~ They’re pretty sure the thing they’re looking for here is a Gorgon, because there aren’t many other explanations when people start mysteriously disappearing and leaving perfect statues of themselves in a nearby forest
~
Dean groans. “Swords? You’re kidding. It’s got to be a sword?” “Well, that’s what Perseus used,” Sam says, frowning. “I guess he didn’t have that many options at the time, though.” “Sam,” Dean says, leaning forward, “has anyone tried shooting a Gorgon?” They try shooting the Gorgon. It doesn’t work.
~
“You’re gonna love this place, Sammy. I think bust size is on the job application.”
~
“My brain feels like it’s about to liquefy and a dead guy just apologized for making me shoot him,” Sam muttered. “I feel great.”
~ Marigold always got special attention because, one, a jammed shotgun often meant a dead hunter and, two, she’d saved his ass more times than he could count. She meant a lot to him, in a twisted, firearms-are-the-closest-things-I-have-to-friends sort of way.
~ “You go look. With my luck it’ll be some nasty demon baby wanting to eat me for lunch.”
“Like my luck is so much better?” He asked incredulously. “I think our numbers are running pretty close there on the Whoops,-I-Ran-Into-the-Spawn-of-Satan scale.”
“You’re the Darth Vader of the Evil Demon Empire. Go order it to smite itself.”
~ “I’ve been watching you for a while.” “Okay, that’s creepy,” Sam mused.  “Then I guess I won’t add that Dean seems to be quite the tiger in the sack.” Anya added with a smirk. Sam grimaced and covered his face with his hands. “I did NOT need to know that.” Dean was torn between smirking and looking alarmed.
~
“Oh, no. I’m not dead now,” Anya said, flashing him a brilliant smile. “I was dead.” Sam blinked. “Well, that clears things up.”
~
“Light Eco.” Jak said easily, as though that didn’t go against pretty much every observed law of eco-behaviour.. ever!
“Well I’ll be a concussed Yakkow,” Sig breathed, not disbelieving him for a second.
~
Tra: “Are we lost?”
Susuan: “I’m going to be the man of our relationship and say ‘No, we’re not.’”
~
She asked him a question. He had absolutely no idea what it was. She asked him another. He didn’t get that one, either. She seemed very real to him in the way her eyes met his, in the way her gaze tried to reach into him and hold on, keep him from falling away again; but her words existed as little more than nonsensical jumbles of sound without meaning, familiar and unfamiliar at the same time, confusing, and disturbing, and more than a little frightening in how her eyes told him she was speaking to him, but his ears had no idea what she could be saying. It took several minutes for her to ask one he finally understood: “What’s your name?” He understood that one. Why he understood it and not the others, he had no idea; but that’s the way it worked out. Unfortunately, his understanding of it was more theoretical than you-should-answer-me, at least in part because her voice was slurring to the consistency of viscous liquid as it wheeled lazy circles around his brain. Despite his inability to answer her, she must have seen something that looked like comprehension in his eyes because she asked it again, “What’s your name?” and then a third time, “Can you tell me your name?” He blinked, but that was as much as he could manage.
She gave up and picked something else to ask. “Can you hear me? Can you understand what I’m saying?” He knew the answer to both of those: Yes and no, respectively. He tried to tell her as much, but apparently, he didn’t say what he was thinking out loud, because she asked him again

Or maybe it was just somebody’s idea of a cute lotto game to play with the small, numbered balls inside his head. Shake the cage and see where they fall. Total crapshoot on which memories come up, and which ones don’t. Memory 16: You once had a huge black dog who was uglier than sin and had glowing red eyes. Or you killed a dog like that. Or maybe you dreamed about a dog like that. Saw it in a movie or something. Anyway, huge black dog with glowing red eyes: You get to remember that. But who you are? Nope, that one didn’t come up today, sorry. Thanks for playing though. Please try again tomorrow.

“Oh. Sorry. Dr. Compton. I used to baby sit him when he was a kid, so I get to call him Danny if I want.”
“My doctor’s name is Danny?”
“Well, Daniel James, if you look at the fancy certificates in his frou-frou office. But if you’ve ever cleaned green shit off his ass, then yeah, his name is Danny.”
~
Beyond that, most of what he knew were things she told him. That he’d threatened half of the town’s chamber of commerce with evisceration if they touched him. That he’d almost died twice in a thirty block ambulance ride. That he’d held a conversation none of them could follow with someone he called Mary, and that he responded to Danny’s initial examination of his wounds with ferocious bursts of profanity in textbook perfect Latin, a language no one in town spoke and no one but Danny understood (Danny went to medical school). That they found four knives strapped to his body or sewn into his clothes, and thirteen tattoos in a variety of locations: one USMC sniper corps insignia on his right biceps (Danny’s dad was a Navy man, but he recognized a corps tattoo when he saw one), seven different Tibetan sigils, each located in direct relation to one of his seven chakras (Danny believed alternative medicine offered advantages over pharmaceutical options for chronic pain relief), and five more symbols branded into his body rather than inked there, each relevant to a different ancient religious or pagan practice, three of them located on major pressure points that regulated blood flow, mental acuity and pain control (Danny had a DSL connection and way too much time on his hands).
~
Doctor Danny, who looked as young as his nickname implied (a nickname he only let his sister use … something he told John the first, second and third time they spoke before he finally just gave up and let him use it).
~
The wonders of modern pharmacology these days: apparently a guy could screw his body for years, then make it mostly better by popping a few pills an hour, every hour, for the rest of his fucking life.
~
After they’d made a cursory search of the surrounding area and discovered no one looking for a man of his general description, and after Danny made it seem as if all the official channels had been explored without any result of worth to consider, they made his new life official by christening him with a new name: John Bearman. It was Julie’s idea, and he liked it better than the second runner up, which was obscene and Danny’s suggestion – payback, he had to assume, for his steadfast refusal to call him by any other name than Doctor Danny, which was beginning to catch on around town, and was something Doctor Danny didn’t think was nearly as funny as the rest of them did.
~
He could buzz Sam’s office from her desk, but she never did when he showed up unannounced. Dean liked to think it was because she wanted him to watch her walk away, but the more likely truth was that Sam was prone to saying things better not broadcast in polite company and public places when she told him Dean was there. Or it could be that he was on a conference call with God or something. Sam traveled in some serious circles. If God needed a good lawyer, Sam would be the guy He’d call.
~
“None of that cappuccino crap,” Dean reminded her, pretty sure that was exactly what he was going to get in trade for the scorecard dig.
“Oh, I know your tastes, Mr. Winchester.” The way she smiled verified that was exactly what he should expect, with extra nutmeg or cinnamon or some whipped cream on top, if she could manage it.
Sam led the way back to an office more reflective of the Sammy he used to be than the Samuel he’d become, saying, “She gets you whipped cream because you made some kind of Karl crack again, and we’re not trading this time.”
“Would I make a Karl crack to her?” Dean’s tone was properly affronted at the suggestion. “How insensitive do you think I am?”
“Oh, we are so not trading.”
~
There was an x-box hidden in the expensive, hand-carved armoire Meredith imported from some third world country the last time she tried to upgrade Sam from regular guy to pompous moron.
~
Love and which direction a werewolf’s going to break when you get too close on its ass are the two most unpredictable variables in the whole, damn universe. So all in all, even though he would have preferred Sam marry a werewolf over Meredith, and Dad would have preferred Sam turn into a werewolf over marrying Meredith, it wasn’t their call.
~
“Oh. Wait. Garrison gave me something to send to you in the Yukon. As long as you’re here, I can save the three hundred dollars in postage.” Sam opened a desk drawer and rummaged around in it for a moment before he pulled out an envelope folded down to a small square with “DUDE” written on it in red crayon. “He hasn’t quite got the whole address thing down yet,” Sam said as he passed the note over. “In his head, you’re kind of like Santa Clause, but with a cooler car. So he thinks you can just put ‘Dude’ on it, and somebody will know how to find you.”
“How’s that working out for him so far?” Dean asked.
“And speaking of Santa Clause,” he went on, “would you quit telling him you’re in the Yukon when you call, please? He made me watch the Iditarod with him last week. I didn’t think there was a sport more boring than golf on TV, but I was wrong. Dog mushing: twice as boring, you just don’t have to whisper. And he asked Meredith if he could quit judo lessons and start taking dog mushing instead. Because of you and your little ‘I’d love to make your soccer game, bud; but I’m going to be hunting werewolves in the Yukon with Wolverine that week’ schtick, my son wants to mush dogs for a living. And he figures with Jo-Jo and Binks, we’ve already got a good start on a twelve dog team.”
~
He said it was his wedding gift to Mary, trading the Impala in for a car so unfuckably domestic it wouldn’t pick up chicks if he parked it in the middle of some all-chick campus and stood beside it, leaning against the wheel well in his leather jacket and shades, arms crossed, looking so James Dean there wasn’t a woman alive who wouldn’t want to fuck him, if not for that unfuckably domestic car behind him. 
He told Sam he and Mary needed that kind of security to their marriage – a car that rendered him utterly unfuckable – because without a car like that to counterbalance his rugged good looks and considerable personal charms, Dean wasn’t sure he was man enough to limit it to just one woman for the rest of his whole, entire life. Mary laughed when he said it, and she kept laughing, because the more she thought about it, the funnier it got. Dean was smiling, too; happier than Sam had ever seen him, so he took the keys without further protest, figuring he could always return it later, once Dean realized he rendered himself utterly unfuckable by anyone who wasn’t Mary simply by looking at her the way he did every time she crossed his line of sight.
~
“Are you telling me how to handle my wife, Sam?” he asked.
Sam smiled at him. “I’m a lawyer, John. I’m telling you how to keep from hiring me later to handle your wife in court.”
~
“You here yet?” Sam asked.
“Nah. Decided to go to Disneyland instead.”
“Thought you were going to call.”
“I did. You didn’t get the message, Psychic Boy?”
“Cute. Mary with you?”
“No, Sam. I left her home with some bottled water and enough food to last her ‘til I got back. Of course she’s here.”
~
“Wild guess here,” she said after a moment, “but I don’t think he wants to talk to you.” She listened for several more seconds, then said, “Well it matters to me.” She listened again, then, speaking to Dean, said, “Sam would like to know if you plan on talking to him any time soon.”
“He’ll be the first to know,” Dean said.
~
“You know,” she said, opening her eyes, “just from the perspective of the one whose bladder is getting elbowed every time you ask for a high five, you’re having the baby next time.”
Dean smiled. “Works for me. Never wanted more than one kid anyway.”
~
“No. He’s not in a coma.” Danny checked John’s pupil response with a small pen light. “He’s in a … it’s called a reduced level of consciousness. Which basically means he’s just not conscious.” He took John’s pulse, then measured half a dozen other vital readings that didn’t require any of his doctor’s bag’s worth of yardsticks and pressure dials.  “That’s not very helpful, Danny,” Julie observed as she watched him work.  “Yeah. I know. Sorry. It’s all that technical doctor stuff I had to go to medical school to learn. It can be very hard to follow for anyone without several advanced degrees and an embarrassingly high IQ.”  She smiled a little. “Care to simplify it for your idiot sister?”  “It’s like conscious, only not. Reduced. As in less. Don’t worry if that’s too complicated. Sometimes I have trouble dumbing things down to laymen’s terms.” He checked the IV he’d started earlier, both at the infusion point on the inside of John’s arm and at the bag that hung from a fortuitously placed plant hook located where it was by virtue of anything but lucky happenstance. “That’s one of the drawbacks of being a genius. It can be very lonely sometimes, this sense of isolation that comes from no one but me fathoming the complexities my very complicated world.”  “You’re quite the miracle of genetics,” Julie said dryly.  “Yeah. Too bad that kind of thing isn’t hereditary.”
~
“Still believe in God?”
She smiled at him. “Yes. Still do.”
“Then pray. Tell Him He owes us a couple, and this would be a really great time to pay up.”
“You can’t tell Him that yourself?”
“I suppose I could, but He doesn’t really listen to me any more. Got tired of being called a mother fucker, I think.”
Sarah leaned over, reached through the window to kiss him. “Sometime you’re going to get struck by lightening for saying that.”
“I dare Him,” Danny said. Then, sticking his head out the window and looking straight up at the sky, he called, “I dare You, ya big pussy!” He waited a three beat then added, “Come on, big boy. Show me what You’ve got.” He waited another couple of moments before pulling his head back into the rover and looking at his wife, one eyebrow lifting as he said, “See? Don’t you feel kind of silly now? Being all educated and shit and still believing in a myth?”
“Lightening, Danny,” she said. “Big, bright, zig-zaggy stuff. If you see it coming your direction, run.”
“Contrary to popular belief, I haven’t noticed God working in mysterious ways so much as just not working at all. At least not for us little guys who aren’t asking for donations in His name on Sunday morning cable. I’ve come to the personal conclusion that He’s a lazy, fucked up, capricious, sadistic, mother fucker of a son of a bitch who gets His large and impressive rocks off torturing people just because He can. And an abusive parent, to boot: God, the father all mother fucker. I should report Him to DFS, have them take all His children away and give them to a deity who isn’t such a mean, negligent bastard.”
“I thought you didn’t believe in Him today,” Sarah said gently.
“I don’t. But if I did, that’s where I’d put my money in the God pot. On the ‘fucked up, capricious, sadistic, mother fucker of a son of a bitch who gets His large and impressive rocks off torturing people’ square. Cause trust me, that’s where the payoff is. That being said and lightening being courted, I’m outta here. Watch your toes, woman. When you’re talking to Him tonight, tell Him it was a really pretty day, and He did a bang-up job in creating chocolate ice cream. Maybe if you suck up, He’ll show a little fucking mercy this time.”
“I’ll be sure and tell Him you said hello.”
“Tell Him I called Him a mother fucker, will you? But say it in a suck-up way that sounds real polite and shit. But if you see any of that glowy, zig-zaggy shit coming your direction, run. Cause just on the FYI front? If I care about you, you can damn straight bet the mother fucker’s got you on His hit list. Which means – this week at least – you’re probably in some pretty serious mortal fucking danger.”
“Just this week?”
“You pissed me off last week, and the jury’s still out on next week. And how can that be a bad thing, given that we’re talking about mortal danger here?”
~
He stopped by a church on the way and spoke to a minister who knew him as a neighbor and a doctor and a civic leader and a snow shoveler, but not as a parishioner. He asked several questions about why shit happened the way it did, and whether or not someone could actually piss God off enough to get a vendetta called in on their ass. Or a jihad. Or a crusade. Or whatever the Methodist version of such things might be. The minister looked at Danny like he thought he was kidding. Danny assured him he wasn’t, so the minister gave him a whole handful of by-the-book answers that were about as helpful as nothing. Maybe a little less helpful than nothing, even. Most of them involved attending church every Sunday and tithing. 
~
“So … you’d come back if I asked?” he asked after a long beat.
“Sure. You asking?”
“No.”
“You not asking and expecting me to read your mind?”
“No.”
“So … just a rhetorical inquiry then?”
“Yeah. More or less. Kind of like that ‘do you love me?’ thing you do.”
“The one during sex or after?” she asked.
“During.”
“Oh. That isn’t really rhetorical, you just never answer me.”
She could hear the smile in his voice when he reminded her, “You never ask at a time when my speaking brain is functional.”
“Oh, trust me, baby, your downstairs brains speaks just fine. Not too many commas, just the right number of exclamation points. And sometimes I could swear it’s speaking in tongues.”
~
“No, I’m not asleep,” Dean answered without opening his eyes. “I’m waiting for you to say something more productive than ‘don’t know’ and ‘hard to tell’.”
~
“Fucked his sense of reality,” Dean repeated. “Is that the medical term for it?”
~
“Fine. Whatever. He told me he got it when some fat guy in a big, red suit broke into the house one night and tried to steal all my Christmas presents.”
“A fat guy in a red suit?” Sam’s tone was almost as surprised as it was amused.
“Yeah. That’s what he told me. Dad said he clocked him, but the fat guy was tougher than he looked. Said he had a mean right hook for a jolly old fat man.”
Sam snorted in a way that nearly choked him. “He told you that? He told you Santa had a mean right hook?”
“Yes. He told me that. But he didn’t say it was Santa.”
“Who’d he say it was?”
“He didn’t say it was anybody. I asked him if it was Santa, and he said he didn’t know, he didn’t bother to ask. When I asked why not, he told me that kind of thing might fly with Army guys; but when a Marine wakes up in the middle of the night to find some fat guy in a red suit creeping around the living room with the lights off, there’s gonna be some fat, red-suited ass kicked no matter who it belongs to.”
“And you believed him?”
“Dude, I was four. I figured out he was lying later, but he never would cop to what really happened. Every time I asked him about it, he insisted it really was the fat guy with the beard; and the only reason I got any Christmas presents at all that year was because my old man found some cookies on the hearth that gave him just enough energy to toss Fat Boy out the front door. I thought for years my dad was the guy who kicked Santa’s ass.”
“That’s why you used to leave the cookies outside on the porch,” Sam realized, laughing.
“Hey, it traumatized me. I figured if Dad kicked Santa’s ass for breaking in before mom died, he’d probably salt and burn the old guy if he found him in our living room after. So since I didn’t think Dad killing Santa would be good for the children of the world – not to mention you and me – I figured it would just be safer to leave Santa’s cookies on the porch along with a note telling him the presents would be fine outside until morning.”
Sam did a little math in his head, then said, his grin splitting wider with every word, “You believed in Santa Claus until you were nine?”
“Oh for Christ’s sake, Sammy. Like Santa is a more outrageous thing to believe in than a closet monster. Dad told me he was real. It didn’t really occur to me he was lying.”
~
“So what if you stop believing?”
“You get hit by lightening.”
“Seems kind of harsh.”
“That’s what you get for calling Him a mother fucker of a son of a bitch at least twice a day for twenty years. Bill like that adds up.”
“Oh. So you’re saying I, personally, get hit by lightening.”
“Yup.”
“If you stop believing.”
“Yup.”
He looked at her out of the corner of one eye. “Why me when you’re the non-believer?”
“Because I have a savings account with Him. You have a high-interest credit card.”
He laughed again. “So the only reason I’m still around is because you’re a signatory on my loan? Thanks. I appreciate that.”
“No problem. Although I prefer to think of it as overdraft protection.”
“Meaning?”
“Meaning pay your own damn bills. I’m just here for the occasional rainy day.”
“Ah.” He nodded. Then after a long moment, noted, “Been raining like a bitch lately.”
~
“I guess I’m not real wild about the idea of putting Dad through what happened this morning again; but I see Danny’s point. You know Dad doesn’t stop picking at a scab even when he hits bone. So if you can’t hide it from him, maybe the best way is pulling it off clean under controlled circumstances.”
Dean snorted. “Yeah. Because everybody knows shooting someone in the head under controlled circumstances is much less lethal than shooting them in the head under uncontrolled ones.”
~
“Hey, you won’t catch me naming my kid Geek. And you didn’t name your kid Awesome, so he obviously wasn’t named after me.”
~
That wendigo just about tore Dad inside out. The only reason he’s still walking around is because Danny’s a hell of a lot better doctor than his whole ‘John survived because John refused to die’ schtick might lead you to believe.
~ “Danny thinks it’s a ticking bomb,” Sam said quietly.
“At least it’s still ticking,” Dean argued. “The last life Dad had blew up in his face more than thirty years ago, and it’s been killing him every since, tearing him apart, burning him alive. Still ticking sounds good to me a this point.”
~ God, she was tired of being pregnant. If John hadn’t wanted another child so badly, she would have made it her business to be biologically incapable of conceiving rather than relying on pharmaceutical alternatives that obviously weren’t as effective as they were cracked up to be.
~
I’m really very tough. Very, very tough, for a pregnant woman who bursts into tears if you tell her you’re out of chocolate ice cream.
~
“Meredith never minded people being overly familiar,” he said. “In fact, I think she enjoyed the attention. But some guy in Wal-Mart put his hands on Mary the other day without her permission, and she decked him. I mean flat-out laid him on the floor. He threatened to sue, so I put some legaleze mumbo-jumbo in his mailbox that scared the shit out of him and he backed off; but I think that may be the first time Dean ever had to admit my law degree was worth the paper it’s printed on.”
“What kind of legaleze?” Julie asked.
Sam’s grin widened. “Sexual Harassment on Mary’s behalf and Inappropriate Touching of a Minor Child on the baby’s. Mary swears the guy’s hand was right on the baby’s ass. I doubt it was, but there isn’t a jury in the land savvy enough to see what an awesome liar Mary is. She just doesn’t look the part, especially when she’s trying not to. They’d believe her in a heartbeat, and probably award damages for mental anguish to boot as long as Dean didn’t give her up by snickering in the back of the courtroom.”
Julie laughed, delighted. “Could you have made that stick?”
“Hell no, but he didn’t know that. He even sent Mary a hand-written apology. Dean tacked it to the refrigerator just so when the baby’s born, he can show her what a rockin’ hardcase her mama is. He’s very proud that his pregnant wife decked some guy.
~
Then, looking around the room, he asked, “Where’s Sam?”
“Yeah. Still no idea.” Dean just looked at him.
“I don’t know where Sam is,” Danny clarified after a beat.
“I heard you,” Dean said. “So I take it I already asked that?”
“You did.”
“Damn. Real sorry about that. Must be a hell of an inconvenience to have to say ‘no idea’ twice. Hey, you don’t happen to know where Sam is, do you?”
~
“Then how did you convince her I didn’t call Sarah about John?”
“I lied,” Sam said. “And then I walked on water.”
~
If anybody can teach a course in “how to not look like a freak,” it has to be Sam Winchester. The plan should take three months, tops. He finishes his shower and wraps a towel around his waist. Ben is standing at the foot of his meticulously made bed at parade rest, eyes forward, still as a statue. Sam groans and pinches the bridge of his nose between his thumb and fore-finger. Okay, so maybe it’s a six month plan.
~
Guns don’t kill demons. Dean Winchester kills demons. There is no hierarchy of demons. Just a list of demons Dean Winchester allows to live. For now. When Dean Winchester was in middle school, his English teacher assigned an essay: “What is Courage?” Dean Winchester received an “A+” for writing only the words “Dean Winchester” and promptly turning in the paper. Dean Winchester does not go hunting, because hunting implies the possibility of failure. Dean Winchester goes killing. When the Boogeyman goes to sleep every night, he checks his closet for Dean Winchester. Dean Winchester does not read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants. If Dean Winchester is late, time better slow the fuck down. If a demon can see Dean Winchester, he can see it. If it can’t see Dean Winchester it may be only seconds away from death. Dean Winchester has to maintain a concealed weapon license in all 50 states in order to legally wear pants. When Dean Winchester sends in his taxes, he sends blank forms and includes only a picture of himself, crouched and ready to attack. Dean Winchester has not had to pay taxes, ever. Dean Winchester owns the greatest Poker Face of all-time. It helped him win the 1983 World Series of Poker despite him holding just a Joker, a Get out of Jail Free Monopoly card, a 2 of clubs, 7 of spades and a green #4 card from the game Uno. He was four. Dean Winchester doesn’t use pickup lines, he simply says, “Now.” Dean Winchester is allowed to talk about Fight Club. Dean Winchester sleeps with a night light. Not because Dean Winchester is afraid of the dark, but because the dark is afraid of Dean Winchester. Crop circles are Dean Winchester’s way of telling the world that sometimes, corn needs to lie the fuck down. Leading hand sanitizers claim they can kill 99.9 percent of germs. Dean Winchester can kill 100 percent of whatever the fuck he wants. Dean Winchester has to sort his laundry into three loads: darks, whites, and bloodstains. Dean Winchester actually died ten years ago, but no Grim Reaper can get up the courage to tell him. A Handicap parking sign does not signify that this spot is for handicapped people. It is actually in fact a warning, that the spot belongs to Dean Winchester and that you will be handicapped if you park there. Dean Winchester’s hand is the only hand that can beat a Royal Flush. Dean Winchester always gets blackjack. Even when he’s playing poker. Dean Winchester sold his soul to the devil for his rugged good looks and unparalleled hunting ability. Shortly after the transaction was finalized, Dean shot the devil in the face and took his soul back. The devil, who appreciates irony, couldn’t stay mad and admitted he should have seen it coming. They now play poker every second Wednesday of the month.
~
“Dude, stop it. It’s not fine. You can’t bleed for an hour and be fine.”
~
“Okay, yes, you can shoot them but-” As the hesitation turns into silence, Dean at last raises his head. “But?” “Give me a moment, I’m usually on the other side of this argument. I’m sure there was a compelling reason.”
~
Mike shifted his gaze to Sam. That was a good sign. Once they started to look at Sam, the deal was half closed. Sam had the best believe-me face in all fifty states. And Puerto Rico. Hell, sometimes even Dean believed him, and he knew when Sam was lying.
~
“I have visions, all right? And you’re going to be possessed by something and go all postal and kill a ton of people if you don’t listen to me.” Sam whispers fast, words all tumbling up on each other and smooshed together. Without missing a beat, Chloe turns, grabs her coat, and says, “Weird. It’s usually Lana who gets possessed.”
~ “Let me go so I can kill the people who’ve hurt me.” Chloe says in a very reasonable tone.  “BEEEP!” Dean makes an obnoxious buzzer noise. “Play again, it doesn’t work like that. However, if you want to give me names, I could visit them each individually and explain to them the error of their ways.”
~
“I do know that if your brother harms one hair on my brother’s head, I’ll hurt you both in ways that will make you useless to a woman.” “I can respect that.”
~
“Have you noticed the way they’ve been looking at each other?” Sam asked his brother as they waded through the waist-deep muck. “Have you noticed the way you’re giving away our location to every crocodile, warthog, and giant albino zombie in the tri-state area?” “We’re going to have to give them the talk.” That stopped Dean in his tracks. He turned to look at Sam. “Why can’t we just let TV teach them about sex, the way God intended?”
~
“Prettier than me?”
“I plead the Fifth.” “I choose to defy the Geneva Convention and interrogate you via tickling.”
~
“Yeah, I have a cell phone, but there’s no owner info on it. Yours?” 
“No, but I’m thinking, we’ve got to have each other in our contacts list—” 
“Hey, not bad,” he said, and flipped through the call log. Sam. Sam. Sam. 315-555-1231. Sam. “Hm.” He hit redial on Sam. 
Shaggy’s phone rang in his hand. He looked down. “Dean,” he read the name off the screen. 
“Well,” Dean said, snapping his phone shut. “Pleased to meet you, Sam.” 
~
“Got some bad news, too. Which one you want first?”
“Whichever won’t make me crash into a tree,” Sam says.
~
“Dean,” he finally got out, and his must have sounded pretty messed up because Dean shut up right away.
~
“Look, we really shouldn’t stay out here. That thing is dead, and they don’t usually move in packs, but I don’t want to take my chances. And if something else comes along I’d rather have access to a weapon that’s actually useful.”
“Yeah, because we’ve got weapons stashed in our room,” Steve joked, his attempt at a laugh dying quickly as he saw Sam’s look. “Seriously? Huh.”
~ Dean swiped a hand over his face in frustration.  “Well, I don’t like it.  I like things I can shoot.”
Josh grinned wryly.  “Oh, come on, kid.  You like your brother, don’t you?”
“Well, sometimes I want to shoot him, too.”
~ “I can’t believe we’re being sacrificed to the Vanir.”
“You’re tied to an apple tree, Sam. What exactly is making this hard to believe?”
“No, I mean, it’s always a couple. Like, a fertility thing.”
A pause. “So they think we’re...? Come on! You’re joking, right?”
“I’m tied to an apple tree, Dean. I’m not making jokes right now.”
“...Does it even count as fertility when it’s two guys?”
“I’m trying not to think about that.”
Dean let his head thud backward into the apple tree. “Man...”
~ Dean had no illusions about how this worked. He moved, Sam died. He put down his weapon, Sam died. But it might buy some time for...Sam made a choked, gasping noise. Jesus. Time—they just needed time. They’d figure out what to do with it later.
~
He met her again when he dove behind a wall to avoid a line of bullets and landed facefirst in her breasts. Ace popped him in the jaw with the butt of her gun, squinted at his face while he clutched it, cursing, said, “Oh, sorry. Didn’t know it was you. Hand me a grenade, will you?” then popped up on her knees to fire over the wall.
“What’re you doing here?” was the first thing out of his mouth. It beat “Grenades? Where?” by a matter of mere nanoseconds.
~
“I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re on about, Evelyn,” the man responded, in what Caroline thought was a massive refusal of reality. “I am undercover. I am stealth personified. I am so undercover that I might come to resemble a bedpan at any moment.”
~
‘You know I’m not going to remember any of this right? And even if I did, I would ignore any advice you gave as a matter of principle?’
‘I know,’ sighed Jack. ‘It’s just instinctual.’
‘Get it out of your system,’ advised Dexter confidentially, going back to unbuckling his wrist computer.
‘Don’t go rescuing girls from barrage balloons. Always check your bed before you get in it. Definitely stay well away from giant pepper pots.’ Jack let out a quick stream of all the things he could think of.
~
“Cool secret base,” he complimented them cheerfully.
~ While none paid quite as well as my old job, they weren’t asking for a piece of my soul, either, so it seemed a fair trade.
~ Dean dodged his brother’s slap to the back of his head with practiced grace, then just as casually snagged Sam’s jacket and pulled him out of the way of the doorpost he was about to walk into.
~ “Hacked, Agent Hobbes?” Dean’s tone of cherubic innocence was overdone enough even Sam snorted.
~
“Sam Winchester. You’d be John Winchester’s boy.” Well, that’s open to debate but it’s not really the time. “Would that get me shot?”
~
“You know you’re bleeding?” “I figured if I ignored it, it would go away.” he deadpans
~
It turns out that Dean really can do nice; it just takes him a while to work out a definition that jives with Sam’s. It’s not ‘well, you didn’t bar his girlfriend and she needed consoling.’ It’s not ‘look, I avoided most of the glass when I dragged him to the curb.’ It’s not ‘yeah, I broke his arm. But I smiled first.’ Four days later, Sam’s trying to work out how to fire his own brother but that’s the same day Dean gets it. Or maybe he just stops yanking Sam’s chain and decides to humour him. It could go either way.
~ Gwen grimaced as the memory came back. “She knocked me out, didn’t she?”
“Very astute of you.” Owen grunted. “Follow the pen with your eyes.”
~ “This glitter stuff is not coming off,” Amy announced flatly. “The smell’s gone but I’m still...” “Naked?” Dean offered with his best Boy Scout smile. Maybe today could be salvaged after all. “Sparkling,” Amy said in a forbidding voice.
~
Dean had explained to Sammy all about Santa; how Santa brought presents for good little boys and that following your big brother around and asking why wasn’t being good.
~
“You’re not funny.” “Spandex, definitely. Superhero spandex. Purple?” “I’m pretending you don’t exist.” “Guys who save little kids with the power of their minds can totally get away with wearing purple tights.”
~
Summary: “Dean’s been missing for two months, three weeks, and four days.” (Or, Dean’s a dumbass. No, really. Well, according to Sam anyway. I mean, Dean might have his reasons, but Sam maybe, possibly, neglected to learn them. Which is his right, as the brother of a total dumbass. So Sam steals a couple of crappy foreign cars, listens to Metallica, fails to read a letter, plays Tetris, and generally has the kind of year he never thought he’d have. Also, there’s text messaging. On the upside, no one dies, but it’s the kind of year he never wants to have again, and it’s all because Dean’s an idiot, if you ask Sam. And Bobby. And Ellen. And Missouri. And some guy in Rhode Island. It’s kind of a consensus, actually.)
~
When she’s seventeen, she gets arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. “A pool cue isn’t deadly…He should have ducked, anyway.”
~ “Don’t I at least get somebody in a naughty nurse outfit for this?” Dean asked, teeth clacking shut as Izzie jabbed the needle in his arm. John glared. “Okay, okay, maybe some kind of anesthesia?”
~ “Sam, you’re in charge of medication. I think there’s a bottle of tequila in the kitchen.”
~ “Dude, are you hugging me?” “No,” Sam says, not moving his arms from where they’re draped across Dean’s shoulders and over his chest in what is clearly at least three-quarters of a hug. “Okay, then,” Dean says. “As long as we’re clear on that.”
~
“Captain Jack Harkness,” he said, giving Manny one of the firmest handshakes of his life. “Err.” He wanted to say his name too, in that exact same Bond, James Bond way, but his brain rebelled. It refused to supply his name, instead going through a list of all the Captains it could come up with. Captain Von Trapp. Captain Caveman. Captain Planet.
~
Which is just fucking ironic from her, considering her middle name must be Trouble or Danger or Holy Shit, Look Out For This One (maybe that’s her Native American name).
~
“Dean’s still upset that you said I had nicer abs,” Sam says as he ducks out of Dean’s half-hearted slap to the head.  “Would I lie about that?” she says, feigning hurt and doing a pout for good measure.  “Yes,” Dean and Sam say simultaneously.
~
Holy shit. She gets it now. “I’m in love with you,” she states, somewhat dazed, looking at the back of Dean’s head. That gets Dean’s attention and he slams on the brakes. He looks at her from the rearview mirror and grins - incredibly amused and oh-so-fucking pleased with himself. There’s something like triumph on his face. “Took you long enough,” Dean says, but there’s honest relief in his tone.
~
The guy managed to project bored now and dangerous as hell at the same time.
~ “Yeah, well what he says and what’s true are sometimes two different things,” Sam said flatly, checking Dean over with the swift efficiency of a man who’d done the same thing too many times before. Dean rallied, managing a frown of weak protest and a weak push at his brother’s invasive hands. “Stop fussing, dude. M’okay.” The relief on Sam’s face was almost too painful to look at. “We’re getting you out of here, and then I’m gonna kick your ass, you hear me?”
~
“Hello? Yes, I’d like to place a call to London, England, please. What? London. It’s only the bloody capital city. Thank you.”
~ “Yes, I’m still in America. Er. No, actually they’ve been able to phone Europe for quite some time now. Yes. The weather is very nice. But listen – what? Oh, well that’s too bad, but you weren’t really expecting England to beat Pakistan, were you? I don’t care if it is an English game; I’ve been telling you for years that the English are crap at it. Anyway, what I’m calling about – it’s 8AM. Yes. In. The. Morning.”
~ OK, I need you to go to my flat and get the red set of account books out of the safe. The red ones, OK? Have you got a pen? Right, the combination is – oh, really? I’ll want you to find a convincing explanation for knowing that.
~ “What was the name, sir?” she asked after pretending to look in the computer files. “Crowley. ‘Crow’ like the bird, ‘ley’ like – like ‘ley.’ First name, Anthony.”
~ “No, I most certainly am not,” Aziraphale said in an offended voice. “I wouldn’t dream of dabbling in the dark forces. I’m an a-.” “Yes. He’s a wizard,” Crowley broke in. “Any other questions? No? Good, let’s answer some of mine, then. Now, about this gatew-.”
~ “So, if we did a summoning spell with it we’d be able to call you up?” Willow asked eagerly. “Well, I’m already here,” Crowley pointed out mildly. Interesting kid, he thought. That kind of hobby should be encouraged.
~ “IS SOMETHING WRONG, CROWLEY?” the radio asked, with deeply satisfied malice. “DON’T WORRY, NO DOUBT WE CAN COME TO SOME EQUITABLE ARRANGEMENT. WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS LITTLE CHAT, CROWLEY. WE HAVE BEEN LAYING IN SUPPLIES. WE HAVE BEEN SELLING TICKE-.” “CROWLEY,” the radio interrupted itself. The tone had no less malice, but more self assured authority. Crowley took the precaution of going to his knees. He very much did not want to know whom this was. “Yes, lord?”
~ Although he had displayed remarkable fortitude on all the roller coasters, it was the Mad Hatter’s Tea Party that had finally defeated Crowley’s digestive system. Hoards of heroic cleaners had spent hours beating back semi-aware demonic vomit.
~ The first rule of The Daniel Thing is: We don’t talk about The Daniel Thing.
~ On the other hand, she wields lightning bolts, so Wash won’t be telling her what he really thinks any time soon.
~ “I’m not a hat,” Eustasia says. She feels that somehow this conversation has gotten away from her. Her sister never said anything about strange boys accusing you of being hats.
~ “India,” Jack says. “Or thereabouts. Really more near Jamaica. By way of Madrid. By way of Bristol.”  “Those places aren’t anywhere near each other,” Eustasia says.
~ The recruiters looked at each other and then Carter said, “Professor Eppes, do you know who we are?” 
“Only categorically, not specifically. Not that I’d tell you if I did know specifically, of course, because then you’d arrest some colleague of mine for leaking sensitive information.” 
~ I’m not dead. I mean, not that I’d have any reason to be dead, it’s just that I know you’re probably worrying about that kind of thing, so I thought I’d say up front that I’m not.
~ “You’re swearing,” Crowley said in surprise. “I don’t bloody swear, I’m just asking you a bloody question!”
~ It was handy, being immortal. It meant that even if you missed your favourite TV programme and videos hadn’t yet been invented, you’d still be around when the missing episode was screened in some sort of ironic “I love the Decades I’d hate to have been Alive in” retrospect.
~ Aziraphale sighed, and went over to the counter. He rummaged round under it and produced a shining scroll. Crowley looked at it in deep mistrust. “Will I vanish in a whiff of redemption if I read that?” he asked.
~ “I found loopholes. Which I am currently exploiting. How much would you say your shop is worth, if you had to buy it today?” “I’m not mortgaging my shop to Hell!”
~ The fairy-girl who’d blown Aziraphale a kiss twirled back into view, upending a box over Crowley’s head. Glittery silver stars settled all over him. There was silence. Crowley looked down at himself. Crowley looked at his car. Aziraphale realized he had less than three seconds before body parts started flying, and rushed out the door. “Excuse me! Excuse me!” he cried, pushing rudely between the onlookers as Crowley made a sound that would have been more at home coming from a really large and angry sabre-toothed tiger’s throat. “If you damage my shop I’ll be really annoyed!” he said, as things around Crowley began to shake. Crowley glared at him. His hair was plastered down with shiny black paint, his suit was ruined, and the glittery stars were everywhere. Carefully and deliberately he took a breath. “I’m covered in paint,” he said. “Er, yes.” “I’m covered in black gloss paint and sparkles.” “So I see.” “My car is covered in black gloss paint, and no doubt is not entirely sparkle free. Why am I not outside killing people, Aziraphale?”
~
“You know,” he said, “some of those northern tribes have invented soap.” “Do they use it?” the young man asked.
~ “She spoke to you,” Crowley said, astonished. “She never speaks to me. Hey! You never speak to me!” he yelled after her. “I’m not surprised,” Aziraphale said. “Not if your usual greeting is ‘hello, sweetheart, got the clap yet?’”
~ “Here you are, sir. Will there be anything else?” Crowley’s inventive reply turned into a squawk as Aziraphale stepped on his foot. The girl tried to kill him with a look again, and slipped away to drum up business.
~ “Why are you even here?” Crowley said in irritation. 
Aziraphale looked vaguely surprised. “I thought you said you wanted to go for a drink?” 
Crowley thought about that for a while. “That was seventy years ago,” he said finally. Stupid angelic sense of time. The bastard had probably looked in his diary, thought ‘oh, I can fit in a quick pint in a few decades.’ “I had to think about it,” Aziraphale said. “Would you like dessert?”
~ “Heaven’s full of wankers,” he proclaimed proudly. “S’not,” Aziraphale said firmly.
~ “Linda King is not my friend,” Lois stated firmly. “You don’t know this woman, Clark. She has no conscience. She couldn’t even spell it.”
~
“Sexy?” he asked, a note of delight in his voice.
~ “I don’t know why you’re asking me,” he said somewhat petulantly. “I’ve liked everything you had on, and half the time it goes in the ‘get’ pile and the other half it goes in the ‘get it out of my sight’ pile, so, clearly, you’re not paying attention to my opinion anyway so why ask?”
~
“Call your damn dog off!” He swore he could see a hint of a grin on the other man’s face. “Damn it Bobby! You can’t still be pissed?”
“Didn’t say I was,” Bobby finally called back. “The only problem I have is that that damn pup won’t listen to a thing I say.”
~
“Yeah. Gonna have one hell of a headache in the morning though.” He mimed a solid punch, and the fleeting smile that crossed his face said best tranquilizer ever.
~
It was missing the king of hearts and an eight of spades, which led to a long and drawn out battle over how to remedy it. In the end, they decided to ignore it and opted to play poker, which only worked for about forty minute before falling to shit over the missing cards, the fact that both of them were cheating, and Dean’s never-ending pout over the fact that it was not strip poker. They tried Crazy Eights after that, promising on their honour not to cheat at it. Bela didn’t; Dean did—”Well, how the fuck was I to know that you told the truth with your stupid pledge of honour?”—and then tried Go Fish, of all the stupid games, afterwards, which worked no better since they were both back to cheating. That game ended with weapons drawn and it was all so dumb that Bela ended up giggling until Dean had to smile too.
~
“Explain to me,” he said with a great deal of mock-patience, “why you need to pack a curler thing and something that friggin’ straightens your hair?”
~
“Why are we stopping?” she croaked, which actually meant why the hell did you wake me, you absolute fucker.
~
“Are you hitting on me, Dean Winchester?”
He chuckled dozily, a heavy rumble against her back. “Gross. No way in hell!” But his hands told a different story, rubbing still at her stomach, and the arms around her were gentle and caressing. And then Dean pressed a firm kiss against the back of her head and laughed again, louder this time. “Maybe a little,” he admitted. “Like… a very little.”
She elbowed him in the stomach and laughed herself. “I have a headache,” she told him primly.
~
Clearing her own throat, she took a look at him in the mirror, and tried to hold her glare. And… checked herself. She thought she’d noticed that particular shirt loose over a t-shirt before, but he’d buttoned it up now, properly, and the jeans he was wearing were without the mud stain she’d noticed on yesterday’s pair. Cleaned up but still Dean. She thought he looked a little sleazy or a little too good depending, she couldn’t decide. Like he’d seen a picture somewhere of what a young married man should look like, and had copied out every detail. This piece of hair parts here and—She smiled before she thought about it. Dean caught it in the mirror quick as lightening and pounced on it with one of his own, like he’d only been waiting for a break in the awkwardness he’d caused to try to smooth things over without actually having to do it himself. Like saying breakfast’s in ten meant awkward, and I’m sorry in Dean-speak. Which was okay, because Bela sighed and said, “Why are you still here?” which meant that she was sorry too.
~
A small smile, his driving smile, was tugging at his lips and— “I’m sorry, Dean,” she blurted, before she could think about it too much.
“What?! Is the great proud—”
Gritted her teeth. “Less sorry by the second!”
~
“I look terrible, Dean! I can’t meet anyone like this. My hair!”
“Of all the vain, stupid things—”
“You could end this all by saying my hair looks good, you know.”
But he bit his lip and snickered. “Why, Bela, lying is morally wrong.” 
~
But Dean was interrupting. “Rooms? Like in the plural?”
“I won’t have any sinning in my house, boy.”
“But… but I’m going to Hell anyway! You just said so!”
~
“What! Since when are you allergic to Jello?”
“Have you ever eaten hospital Jello?”
“No.”
“I have. Put it down.”
With a long suffering sigh, Sam wrote down Jello under allergies. “Family medical history?”
“My brother is retarded.”
“Very funny.”
~
Dean raised his eyebrows. “Sure,” he said. “I’ve been looking forward to you setting yourself on fire since you were two.”
~
“Of course I know that.” Alex rolled his eyes, treating the question as seriously as he felt it deserved. “I’m not crazy; I’m hallucinating. There’s a difference.”
~ “Why is he pointing a gun at you?” Tish added. Priestly stared at her. “Okay, you were here a second ago when I said I didn’t know, right?”
~
“Alright, everyone stay calm,” Dean’s smooth baritone helped ease their panic, if only a little. Well, until he pulled out a shotgun.
~
“Don’t tell me to—” Dean cocked the gun. Priestly shut up.
~
Cam reminds himself that he’s in charge of saving the world and doesn’t have time to smack a smart-ass kid upside the head.
~
“I call shotgun!” he said, getting in the front of the car.
“I call nine millimeter,” she said, getting in the back. 
~
“You need a—”
“A minute?”
“I was going to say ‘a drink’.”
“That too.”
~
Namor has pointy Spock ears, can communicate with aquatic life, breathe underwater, possesses an enhanced physique to deal with the high pressure depths and, of course, has the obligatory tiny wings on his ankles that enable him to fly. What’s that you say? That last one seems a little out of place? Why would an aquatically themed superhero flit about on delicate little calf-wings? According to the creators: Fuck you, that’s why. 
~
So, while Namor may not be as likeable as, say, Spiderman, he also isn’t as useful in battle as, say, Spiderman.
~ Apparently, he became so utterly repentant in prison that he volunteered as a test subject for a secret government project that gave him diamond-hard skin and superhuman strength. How the project obtained funding for their proposal, entitled “Give Diamond-hard Skin and Superhuman Strength to Angry Convicts” is yet another prime example of the dangerous incompetence of the Nixon administration.
~ “No really. There were Rambo books. No, they weren’t composed entirely of onomatopoeias meant to represent the sound of explosions.”
~ “In fact, the Mayan sun god Kukulkan, to whom the sacrifice is made in the movie, never asked for and was never given such a sacrifice, so whatever priest was offering Kukulkan a human heart was probably just creeping him the fuck out.”
~ When asked why, specifically, they had to harvest the kidneys of baby hamsters to mutate, the scientists laconically replied that “they scream much better than the big ones,” before excusing themselves outside to laugh maniacally for the next 15 minutes.
~ “We’re not saying they’re lying (legally we can’t), we’re just saying they have something in common with Pinocchio (both are fucking liars).”
~ “I merely sent him a copy of your first book, you did all the talking.”
Remus paused, his lips twitching. “You seem to have merely sent my books to a lot people Dumbledore”
They entered the lift that had finally cleared, and Albus blinked innocently. “I find it makes a wonderful present for all occasions.”
~
Oh, he wants her so much that it feels like he needs her, but functioning, breathing, starting to move on? She taught him how to live again. He can carry on living, for her, whether she is there or not.
~
He’s drowning in loose, damp soil and Dean will never let him live it down if he’s killed by a bunch of girls.
~
“If this is you ‘fine’, I’d hate to see you after someone whacked you with a bat. Oh wait. That happened.” He glared at his brother. “And you didn’t tell me about that, why?”
Sam shrugged and then started to topple back. Dean grabbed his arm and controlled the collapse. “‘Cause,” his brother supplied.
“‘Cause? That the best you can come up with, Einstein? You can’t keep this stuff to yourself. What if your head was cracked open-”
“S’not.”
“Or you dropped into a coma-”
“Won’t.”
~
“Dad said you’d get me a Popsicle when you came home,” Sammy added. “Can you get me a Popsicle?” 
“He’s been pretty patient,” John said. “Five hour’s a hell of a long time to wait for a Popsicle, if you ask me.”
“Can you bring me two Popsicles then?” Sammy asked hopefully.
~
“Yeah, I’m new too,” he gave her a bright smile. “Probably just hang out with you lot until I meet some cooler people.”
Luke leaned across and shook his hand thoroughly, saying, “HowdoyoudoI’mLukeSmith,” in one breath.
Clyde gave him a strange look. “I was just kidding earlier, but I mean it now.”
~
“All the bowls are little,” Sam defended, shaping his hands into a round that was supposed to indicate just how tiny but didn’t really work because his hands, like everything else, were massive and he was encompassing a space about the size of Jess’s head.
~ There were more important things to think about right now…Like the fact that he had apparently decided to lose his memory not in the safe comfort of his own home, but in somewhere out of a bad horror movie.
~ “I feel so... so...”
“Abused? Duped? Used?” Lois listed cheerfully.
“What are you, a thesaurus?” Linda asked.
~ And yes, despite everything they had put each other through, and all the time she had killed him over their brief relationship, he found himself caring for Bela Talbot. It was a delicate relationship—extremely delicate—and it must have been the masochist in him that called to her, because there was no other explanation for why he had developed some kind of twisted form of affection for a woman that shot him through the heart on a regular basis. On the other hand—he really could do without getting shot at every time they encountered each other. Then again, if he saved her life, maybe she might feel a small bit of gratitude towards him and not shoot him every time they saw each other.
~ He’d figured Hell would be warmer. And there’d more demons, and not quite as many paramedics. And he’s not totally sure, but as far as he understands the nature of Hell, the whole pain thing is a pretty vital component, so it seems unlikely that they’d be strapping an oxygen mask to his face and shoving a needle into his arm. Morphine, feels like, as the sudden sharp-sweet tang of lemon fills his mouth.
~
Then he sees Sammy’s face looming over him, giant hands reaching out to paw at his arm. Petting him like he’s some kind of injured dog, for fuck’s sake. And now the big sap’s tearing up. Just perfect.  The paramedic finishes doping him up, smiles fondly at Sam. Great. Dean wonders if he could get a medic alert bracelet with ‘not gay, just brothers’ inscribed on it. It would save time.
~
Dean lifts his own hand in a half-wave, and whoa, vapor trails. That’s some good shit in the IV.
~
“In all honesty, and I wouldn’t lie to anyone with a gun that big, I have no idea.”
~
Sam was sure the boy hadn’t been there a minute ago (a fact which set off massive amounts of internal alarms) but right at this moment the only offense that could possibly be pinned on him would be Slouching With Intent. Off the top of his head, however, Sam couldn’t think of any malicious creatures or spirits known to manifest in people’s motel rooms wearing scruffy jeans and giving cryptic statements.
~
Sam wasn’t sure if he was insulted or not at being called an inferior Antichrist.
~
“Ever tried to shoplift a Christmas tree? Well, let me tell you. It’s not easy.”
~
“What is a sugar plum, anyway?” “It’s a candy. Kinda like a gumdrop. Also a fruit, like a giant grape, that doesn’t have a bitter skin.” “You’re a fruit like a giant grape.”
~ It is the event that kicks off the Winchesters’ Christmas season, which mostly consists of laying low, going after angry spirits that like to force or frighten poor, unsuspecting misers into showing their Christmas spirit, and buying rocksalt in bulk. From historical precedent, one can conclude that the Sinterklaas is intent on shoving one or the other of the Winchester boys in a sack and carrying him off back to Spain or wherever its lair happens to be. In order to do this, the Sinterklaas uses a bundle of twigs held together with a red ribbon which it calls a Virgács -- which is actually a Hungarian term, but that’s neither here nor there -- as a whipping device. As Dean can attest, despite its whimsical appearance, getting whipped by a Virgács really stings.
~ In following the tradition in which it had been created, the Krampus went up to the door of the farm house, knocked, and, when Dean came to answer the door with Sam trailing behind, requested that the boys perform a song or dance to show that they’ve been good little boys and deserved to get some candy. At which point, Dean shot it in the face with a BB gun. Dean was only saved the supreme indignity of being shoved into a sack and carted off to Spain by Sam bellowing his little three-year-old head off and John coming barreling up with an actual shotgun, driving the Krampus off. That was also the year that Dean graduated to actual firearms.
~ “Dean, I swear to God, you better be in custody, or—” Sam cut the rest of that sentence off. “Just call me when you get this.” 
~ “Good morning, sunshine,” the blonde said, and she didn’t look nervous or helpless anymore. “We’re going to play a game now, you’ll like it. It’s called ‘Tell me where your brother took my dad and you won’t find out what a taser to the balls feels like.’ “
~ “They’re going to try to kill us tomorrow. And they have freaky mind-powers and invincibility, and we have...salt.”
~ This was easily in the top ten of worst ever. Maybe even the top five. Definitely up there with the guy dissolved in the bathtub and the corpse that had been eaten alive by dogs. And the woman who had liquefied in the refrigerator. Come to think of it, maybe he’d seen too many disgusting crime scenes.
~ He assumes Jess didn’t find his box of weapons, or this conversation would be progressing differently.
~ …remarking to henchman A how the hero was ‘about to fall into’ a devious trap he’d set (devious in this case meaning “easily escapable”).
~ He fights like someone having a stroke. To be fair, the movie’s supposed to be campy. To be unfair, it looks like they didn’t so much choreograph their fights as just run around flailing their arms like the set just caught on fire.
~
“You should send me,” Derek said flatly. “I’m a better shot.” “You’re a better everything,” McManuss said without looking at Derek. “But it’s a suicide mission. The trick with suicide missions is not actually sending someone who wants to die, Reese. We need him to come back in one piece.”
~ “Then where am I?” He clutched the item, glaring at it as if he could extract the truth from it through the sheer force of wanting it. “Which one’s the ‘you are here’ dot? What’s the scale? How close are the other dots to me?”
~ “I will kill you,” the big man growled.
The man’s fingers dug into his flesh. “Then I… won’t be… able to… answer you,” he forced out.
~
“I’ll shoot.”
“So will I.” The big man showed his teeth. He was still holding his own weapon.
“Then we’ll both be dead. How nice.”
~
“Take some holy water with you,” he called out after his brother. Dean turned back to flash his jacket open, the glint of his flask visible inside his pocket, his face schooled in a clear Yes, Mom.
~
He had contingency plans for a number of apocalypses, from a Hellmouth opening to a full on Book of Revelations, four horsemen and the angel with the sword deal. He planned for a zombie outbreak, nuclear wasteland, and a bird flu epidemic (although in that case the plan is to grab Sam, hole up in a Canadian shack, and eat a lot of beef, but it is still a plan). He was completely unprepared for an alien invasion.
~
“Ok, did you all go to obscure school? What the hell are you talking about?”
~ The original TV show survived in the dark days before the Internet when men were prepared to sit through 30 minutes of lame karate chops because the leading ladies thought ‘bra’ was just something frat boys call each other. These days you can’t get through a shampoo commercial without at least side boob. And with the Internet, you can choose four pornographic words at random and find a site dedicated explicitly to that, and also that with goats.
~ It had been one of those routine surveys of an uninhabited planet that turns out to be a lot less routine and a lot more inhabited. The whole capture had been pretty quick; less a fight and more just pathetic.
~
“That guy just turned to dust,” Satterfield points out from behind her. “Yeah, I noticed that,” Hailey murmurs
~
From her position, he looked suspiciously like someone buying coffee.
~
“It’s a long story,” he hedged.  “I’ve got all night and a plate full of waffles,” Hailey pointed out. By the time he finished his story, Hailey’s plate was clear except for a sticky film of syrup and the single bite of waffle that had been on the fork for the last five minutes.
~ “What the hell were you people thinking?” “Mostly, ‘Oh God. We’re all gonna die,’” Harris admitted. “The world was ending and we were pretty much out of ideas.”
~
“Unscheduled off-world activation,” Walter informed the room at large as though they hadn’t already noticed.
~
“Yes, well, be that as it may,” Giles plowed determinedly on, “according to the Book of Aurelius” –he hefted the book to quote directly– “In the time of the ninth great darkness the travelers shall come and lead them home. The portal will stand open, its guardians will fail in their watch, and they shall pass to earth.” “Can we say ‘disaster waiting to happen?’” snarked Xander. “Hey, wouldn’t it be really embarrassing if it turns out we’re the guardians?”  “I rather think we’d know if we had a mystical portal,” Giles pointed out. ~
“Belus! He killed Omoroca.” Everyone stared at him blankly. “Nem’s wife,” he clarified. No one’s expression changed.
~ She paused and turned on the top step. “About the holy water, is there anything special that needs to be done to, ah, bless it?” Willow and Xander shared a look. “Dear god, make this water extra holy and send me a pony for Christmas?” Xander shrugged. 
~
These people were the crack team that had stopped apocalypses, and they didn’t know how to use a communications radio? How did they coordinate their attacks? Yell really loudly?
~ “He followed me home,” he told his brother with enough sarcasm to make the truth sound like an ironic lie.
~
“Manticore? Mythological creature? Part lion, part man?” “Nah. Government agency. Part genetic manipulation, part bullshit.”
~
The other woman nodded, her expression dark. Aeryn suspected she’d seen merely more than Zoe had, not worse.
~ Kinda mad is clearly Sammy-speak for vein-throbbing apoplectic rage. Jim can’t help but smile.
~
Sam digs an elbow into Dean’s side, making frantic throat-slashing motions with his other hand. Not so much as a signal to stop, but more as an example of what might lie in Dean’s immediate future if he doesn’t shut up.
~
“I’ve seen enough beach party movies to know if this was Limbo there’d be way more semi-naked chicks in coconut bikinis and hula skirts.” “That’s the dance, not the theological construct, you dork.”
~
Jim wasn’t sure, but he thought he caught a stray Hail Mary somewhere in amongst the desperately-muffled curses. Sammy, most likely. The profanities were much more Dean’s style.
~ “I’m dancing on the inside,” Dean deadpans, and hauls a large bag of what looks to be highly illegal weaponry over his shoulder.
~ “You’re a bastard, John Winchester,” Caleb informs him, like it’s news or something. “Yeah, and you’re an asshole, Caleb, but I try not to let that ruin our beautiful friendship.”
~ The explosion was loud enough to wake the dead, undead and all the zombies in between 
~
She picks her younger self up, spins her around, presses a kiss to her temple. Sam leans over. “Can she do that? Shouldn’t the world explode or something?” 
~ “Hey, listen, you can call me Dean—” He stopped, because Rimple was staring at him like he’d suggested Rimple could cut off his own head. “You can’t call me Dean?” Rimple shook his head, very fractionally. “Right,” Dean muttered.
~
“Er, that’s a bit odd, now,” Hagrid said. “Their kind don’t usually go for boys, not once they’re full-grown.” He lowered his voice. “I, er, wouldn’t suppose—”
“Yeah, not by a long shot,” Dean said. “And I still don’t believe in you,” he told the unicorn, which ignored him and mumbled at his hair affectionately.
~ John turned on his heels and peered at Rodeny through his sunglasses. “McKay. Who the hell measures engine torque in Newton-meters?” Rodney bristled. “That’s the proper SI unit.”
“You can’t use SI units on a car like this,” John protested, mildly horrified. “That’s like... that’s like playing cricket on the Fourth of July.”
~ “You know,” Rodney said, waving his fork dangerously. “Mentally unstable war vet dishonorably discharged for trying to kill his demon-possessed commanding officer, hiding a violent streak and a death wish behind a cool demeanor that fools nobody.” John set his spoon down. “They said that They actually used the words ‘cool demeanor’?” “When they were being nice,” Rodney said around a mouthful of omelette, “or worried that you would shoot them.”
~ “No,” he said, his voice quiet and level. He was manifestly lying through his teeth. “I have no idea who those men were.” 
“Uh huh. So you have no idea if they’re likely to try again.” 
Jackson looked up, startled. Obviously that hadn’t occurred to him. “We should get out of here.” 
~
“I don’t suppose you remember what happened the last time you came home with someone who really, really didn’t want to file a police report?” Oh, now that was more than a little unfair. 
~ “I’m pretty sure it’s him, actually. I was talking to him after he finally got a pain shot, and he can answer questions in Russian and Quechua if you catch him off guard. If he wants to call himself --” Blair looked at the flimsy carbon of the sign-in sheet he’d filled out for Dr. Jackson, “Walter Budge, and he doesn’t want the police involved -- well, all right, maybe he’s just eccentric, I don’t know.”
~
Jack snorted, “Of course not,” simultaneously with Teal’c agreeing, “Indeed it is.” 
“No,” Jack repeated firmly. “It isn’t.” 
“I was mistaken,” Teal’c said. “It is not.” 
~ “Someone’s frozen time again,” Crowley said, sounding annoyed, but not particularly surprised. “What do we do?” Aziraphale asked. “Walk out without paying.”
~ Dana waved him in.  “Back me up about the helium balloons, Casey.” “Sure,” he nodded.  “We should definitely have helium balloons.” “Thank you.”  Natalie grinned Dana glared.  “Wrong side.” “Sorry,” Casey shrugged, looking anything but sorry. 
~
“Get some sleep,” Ronon says abruptly, eyes trained on Sheppard. Sheppard turns around, a wordless exchange that involves no facial expression and a lot of glaring, but Sheppard shrugs, levering himself out of the chair in a fluid motion that belies the exhaustion seeping from beneath his skin.
~ “That’s weird,” Sheppard says, sounding bemused.
Dean stares at him. “How have you lived this long?”
“Amazing luck,” Sheppard admits as the sound of someone kicking the door echoes through the stairwell. 
~ “We will so talk about this later. Actually, there’ll be yelling. First there will be doctors, then there will be yelling. But for now, let’s just go.”
~
494 was starting to realize that a whole lot of what the brothers said to each other was some sort of code. It wasn’t deliberate most of the time. Just a way of having a perfectly normal conversation to cover things the rest of the world found alarming. Overnight Bag really meant ‘Arsenal in a Sack.’ And the ‘old usual’ meant ‘which array of deadly implements would you like to bring home with you this evening.’ What was worse was that if there was an ‘old usual’, then there were most likely variations on the theme.
~ “If I let you drive, will you stop trying to crush me under your angst?”
~
“Excuse me?” Deck asked, honestly startled. Biggs was not a unit who usually mouthed off.
“With all due respect, sir, why don’t you tell me?” Biggs merely repeated, as though the Colonel may not have heard him the first time.
~ “You do something stupid virtually every night, Sam, why would tonight be any different?”
Sam shook his head.  “Why am I even asking Toby this?” “Are you addressing your imaginary friend?” Toby asked.  “Because that would definitely be something stupid you could do tonight.” “I was addressing myself.” “Also stupid.” 
~
“For using my name, Isaac?  Too few people dare, these days.  I’m almost startled to hear it.” “What about Abbey?”  “Well, she prefers terms of endearment.” Isaac looked skeptical.  “Since when?” “Perhaps ‘nicknames’ would be more accurate,” Bartlet said, grinning a little. “Ah,” Isaac nodded sagely.  “She’s still fond of ‘jackass?’” “Frequency of use would suggest.”
~ “I was swimming,” Bartlet protested. “You were drowning.” “Potato --” “Your arms were flailing around, you were sinking, and your little floatie things --” “It was a life jacket.” “Sure it was, sir.” “I was fourteen years old. I was not wearing ‘little floatie things.’” Isaac shrugged.  “Okay, sir. But you realize that I have photographic evidence at my disposal, right?”
~ “No,” Josh interrupted, eyes wide.  “Don’t say that near her.  She’ll kick my ass.” Dan looked confused.  “Wouldn’t she kick my ass if I was the one who said it?” “Donna’s mind works in mysterious ways,” Josh answered ruefully. 
~ “Casey,” Dana pouted.  “Jack won’t make me a martini.” Casey looked over her head at the bartender.  “Good man.” 
Jack rolled his eyes, popped the top off a Sam Adams, and handed it to Casey. “Brilliant man,” Casey amended.  He took a swig.
“Casey, I have an idea.” Casey gave CJ and apologetic grin and turned to Dana.  “I’m not ordering a martini for you.” Dana pouted.  “Why not?”
“Because, I don’t drink martinis.  I drink beer.  Men drink beer.  You don’t think Jack would be suspicious if, two minutes after he handed me a very manly beer, I ordered a girlie little martini?” 
~ “Uh-uh,” Dan grinned, holding the notepad to his chest.  “What’s the magic word?” “I’ll kick your ass if you don’t give me that notepad.” “Close enough.”
~ “Damn,” Dan mumbled to Casey.  “We should’ve written in iambic pentameter.” “Right,” Casey agreed.  “Except for the part where we’re not actually Shakespeare.”
~ Absently, she toyed with the key at her neck and she heard a tsk of annoyance from her side.
“Would you stop that?” he muttered, batting her hand away. “I keep forgetting you’re there when you tinker with that thing.”
“Wait a minute…this works on you?” Martha asked, surprised.
He shrugged. “Yeah, of course it does,” he admitted.
“Then how did you know where I was, the first time we met?” she asked.
“Heightened sense of paranoia,” he said.
~ “Nah, actually, I think I might just turn in early. Everything’s starting to look like Sanskrit.”
Dean bent over his shoulder with a frown, staring at the screen. “Dude, I think that is Sanskrit.”
~ “Did he just growl at us?” He turned back. “We’d get out if we could find the way. So be a nice savage native and show us the way out, then we’ll just run along, and no hard feelings.” The man bared his teeth, and hissed like a cat. “Or you can just do the feral thing.”
~ Is this one of those times I’m supposed to just listen and empathize, or can I offer a solution at the risk of solving your problems for you?
~
“I was being rhetorical. Do you know what rhetorical means? Don’t worry, that was rhetorical too.”
~
“Is it me or are John Does the fastes growing segment of the population?”
John ignored the ME. “Any identifying marks?”
“Well, the six bullet wounds…”
~ “God dammit, Sam, I told you not to read my mind!” Dean says, furious.  “Well, how else was I supposed to sync up our stories?” “Man, why couldn’t you just bend spoons or something?” Dean grumbles. Sam just laughs and decides not to mention the fact that he now knows for sure that Dean not only watches Oprah but also reads her magazine when he sees it in convenience stores while on his junk food runs. More specifically, he decides it would be better to just order a subscription in the name of Deana Louise Winchester and let Dean figure the rest out on his own.
~ He looks up ghouls and finds something vague about ‘smiting’ and ‘casting down’ which Dean translates into: ‘Kicked ghost ass. Have delivered smack down.’
~
“Snatched Lady Haversham’s pearls from right under her nose.”
“Funny place to wear pearls…”
~
“Don’t judge a book by its cover,” he says.
“Or a diner by its health code violations?”
~ “Excuse me? The ‘other me’? Dude, we’re not in a Star Trek episode.”
~
“Just relax,” Martha told him. “I’m going to find us some transport.”
Reese laughed painfully. “This I gotta see.”
“Oh ye of little faith,” Martha declared as she pushed the basket in front of her. “Now be quiet, you’ll attract the guards.” 
~
“Not bloody likely – and what do you think you’re doing?” Martha added, as she grabbed him around the waist.
Reese looked at her in disgust. “I’m standing up, what does it look like I’m doing?”
“Looks a lot less like standing up and more like weaving about, to me,” Martha snorted.
“You’re going to argue with a dying man?”
~ “I didn’t know you were going to be here,” he said, defensively.
“I have to warn you,” she said flippantly, booting up her computer, “I have a third-degree black belt. I don’t want to have to hurt you, but you’re really barking up the wrong tree here.”
“I’m not a stalker,” he said, getting frustrated.
~ I swear it’s like they’re wearing heels and jumping up and down on the floor while listening to some Spanish television show with a small child yelling at a billion decibels.
~ Take your worst shopping experience - most body-image-degrading, most frustrating in selection, most frustrating pricewise - and throw in a language barrier and no sleep for over thirty-six hours. That was my afternoon.
~ Look, we don’t need to know the details. We go to watch Bruce Willis a) shoot people and b) taunt his adversaries with western vernacular and implications of an Oedipus complex. Well guess what, he doesn’t get to do that. Months into filming, the head honchos decided to trim the film behind the director’s back in order to get the magical PG-13 rating, which, according to producers, would attract a new demographic at the small cost of making the film suck. 
~
“I’ve had worse,” he said, forcing a smile. The top layer of his skin slid off like a glove two sizes too big and fell to the ground, the two of them staring at it in abject disgust. Connor winced and looked away. “Okay, I stand corrected,” he said.
~ “Damn demon shoved a barbecue fork into my stomach,” he muttered. “Considering how many inches of my intestines came out with it, I think I’m allowed at least another two weeks of sulking.”
~ Cordy had promptly snarked that she’d been asked to stop after five minutes of harp-playing (four and a half minutes early, Lorne had later remarked) and besides, her idea of Heaven was much more along the lines of sitting right next to Spike and repeating “I’m not touching you” until he went insane.
~ EXCUSE ME, he said, not impolitely. BUT YOU ARE HOLDING UP THE END OF THE UNIVERSE.
~ “If I’d seen you, I know I wouldn’t’ve forgotten you,” the man replied, as he leaned back on what passed for space. “You’ve got fabulous cheekbones.” He raised a perfect eyebrow and smiled in a way that was quite possibly illegal.
MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO BE PUT OFF BY THE WAY THEY AREN’T ATTACHED TO CHEEKS, Death responded a little sharply. 
~ “Mom talked to his parents, and Milton got into major trouble. But that’ll probably just make him want to get back at me.” Beth looked unhappy but resigned. “I can see it now. Milton bumping into me every chance he gets ‘by accident’. Milton sneezing on my lunch tray every day ‘by accident’. Milton stepping on my foot every time I pass him in the hall ‘by accident.’”
“Not unless Milton accidentally wants his spine ripped out through his nose.”
~ The Doctor’s friend introduced himself as Martin, but Jack was pretty certain that wasn’t his real name. Largely because the Doctor kept forgetting it, and calling him “Adam” and once or twice slipping into “Ben.”
~ “I resent that. I remember every single one of the aliases you’ve used,” the Doctor protested. “And possibly some of the ones you haven’t used yet.”
~ But he didn’t pause, just told the blaze to calm the fuck down because Sam was still somewhere in the house. He felt the fire, like it was somewhere in his mind and it—listened.
~ “Man, Katie is gonna kill you, you do know that.” “Us,” Dean quipped. “You’re an accomplice now.”
~ Chuck was even more energized, enthusiastically recounting the whole encounter to Sam regardless of the fact that Sam had been right there with him the whole time.
~ “It was a bit...anticlimatic, don’t you think?” Danny asked from behind his shoulder. Dean rolled his eyes. “Do you want them to burst up behind you and try to kill you one last time?”
~ “You took a vote,” Faith corrected, turning back to her map and wrestling with the edge that was trying to make a break for it. “I abstained on the grounds of the whole idea being stupid.” “Therefore, I won,” Cameron said
~ Faith was hopping from foot to foot though, more excited than he had ever seen her. “I heard you can kill people by just blinkin’ at them.”  “Sorry, just to clarify,” Cameron interrupted. “Good guy?”
~ “So now what?” said Tony.  Everyone looked at him expectantly.  “Oh no.  No, no, no.” But he went, armed with a screw driver, and followed Abby and McGee’s shouted directions for turning off and dismantling the, quite literally, damned thing.  The computer tried to electrocute him. That was when Gibbs shot it. After that it was practically a cake walk to dismantle. 
~ “You mind telling me what happened?” he asked, not even trying to hide his exasperation as he took Sam’s chin in hand and examined his face. It was hard to tell what was alcoholic haze and what was the beating, but at least the pupil’s were equal and reactive to the meager alley lighting. What he could see in the swelling face, anyway.
“Fight,” Sam enunciated carefully, and Dean shook his head. Definitely drunk.
~
“I wouldn’t say that to his face,” Kate warned.
“I think he knows he’s bald, Kate. He probably uses steal wool on that dome.”
~
“What are you doing?” “What’s it look like?”  “It looks like you’re holding a washing machine at gun point.” “Bingo.”  “Okay, let me rephrase. Why are you doing that?”  “Because the little fucker can’t hide forever is why,” Dean says, voice a low growl while he nudges the washing machine with what looks like all the menace he can muster. It’s not really that menacing considering he’s wearing only a t-shirt, boxer shorts and one sock.  “Oh my god, we’re not doing this again,” Sam groans, slapping a hand to his forehead. There’s no monster that eats socks.”  “There is,” Dean insists. “It’s been following us for five damn states and it got my last pair this morning.”  “Well, technically it only got one.”
~
“I don’t care if they were a bunch of old ladies, Sam. They conned us!” “And kicked us in the shins and kneed us in the groin. And I’m pretty sure one of them beat you over the head with a Bible.”
~
“Y’know, we never did get to finish Topeka.”  “That’s because someone left in the middle of the night, leaving the other person to answer questions about some jackass impersonating a Federal agent in the cold light of a Kansas morning. In nothing but a sheet!” “Federal agent,” he scoffs. “Park ranger!” He pauses for a moment before a wicked smile graces his face. “Just a sheet? Damn.”
~ Chloe gawked, initial response dying on her lips. “You killed mistletoe,” she deadpanned. “You brought me out into the middle of the woods to kill mistletoe?”
~ She always thinks of it in bold, with a healthy dose of snark on the side.
~ “I know, I know. But the little girl couldn’t find her cat -- Mrs. Pickles,” he says as an aside, like they all need this particular piece of information. Like maybe it’d come up on Jeopardy some day. “And then there were the bikers and you know how that goes --” And then there is much waving of hands and Lorne gets the feeling like he should be at a PTA sponsored carnival.
~
Dean mumbled something and gripped the book tighter. Sam couldn’t help grinning, shaking his head slightly as he tried again. “Dean, someone’s stealing the Impala.” Dean’s feet were actually on the floor and moving before his eyes were open, the book landing with a thud on the carpet. He blinked and staggered slightly, his balance working to catch up with the rest of him, and hearing sniggering he focused his attention and saw Sam watching him with a seriously amused look on his face. Realisation dawned and the bleary eyed look became a glare.
~
“Of course it is. You know just once I’d like to take a job that doesn’t involve trees or rivers.”
“I’ll make a note. Although in fairness it looks like just the river this time. The forest is on the other side.”
~
“Sure. I always know where I’m goin’.”
The map dropped into Sam’s lap again. “Oh, right, like that time that banshee startled you and you took off and nearly ran off the cliff?”
“It was dark.”
“Right. How ‘bout the time–”
Dean shifted in the seat. “Hey, look. Lake Flathead.”
~
Dean gave him a smile that was just a tad too enthusiastic. “There’s always dynamite.”
~ “When I don’t feel like I just ran a marathon anymore, you are so getting a lecture about going out hunting on your own.”
“Oh, yeah?” Dean sounded even more breathless than he did. “Who got themselves thrown in a freezing lake yesterday by a friggin’ otter?”
“An otter that eats people,” Sam corrected, looking for where the blood was coming from.
~
He opened one, but only to give his brother a baleful look. “Go away or I’m gonna shoot you.” Sam just glowered at him, utterly unimpressed. He had to be losing his touch. 
~
“It’s a perfectly respectable job!” “It’s a car shaped like a pizza.” “It’s not shaped like a pizza, it has a pizza-shaped...thing...on the roof.” “There are giant pepperoni slices glued to the doors, Sam. It’s a pizza on wheels.” ~ He grabbed Sam by the shoulders and shook him, hard. He’d seen enough daytime hospital soaps to know that wasn’t what you were supposed to do with comatose patients (but what you were supposed to do was cry and tell them how much you loved them and how sorry you were for accidentally sleeping with their evil twin or stealing their freakin goat or whatever, damn, those shows were all the same, and that was definitely not going on Dean’s agenda for the afternoon), but he figured this was an emergency situation. At first Sam just flopped about like he was on drugs or something (and Dean eyed the IV bags and figured that actually he was, lots and lots of drugs), but after a moment or two his eyelids fluttered, and seconds later he came to.
~ Blakefield. He filed the name away between James Blunt and Jar Jar Binks in the drawer in his head marked ‘people whose asses I’m gonna kick if I ever get the chance’ (yeah, OK, so Jar Jar Binks was a fictional character, but he was in an alternate dimension for Christ’s sake, and if that was possible, anything was, and Jesus that guy was a jackass).
~
“I can to touch my nose,” Sam said, sounding petulant, and went for his nose, poking himself in the eye in the process. “Ow,” he said miserably. “Shit.”
~
“Panties?” He shot Caleb a disgusted look. “You triaged me with panties?”
“Hey, it’s all I had. Besides, I worked hard for those.”
Dean sighed, and put the underwear back on his head. “Still molesting manikins, I see.”
~ “Let me explain this again,” Sam attempted slowly, his hand resting on the Bible he’d pulled from the bedside table drawer, “when God wants to punish people, He doesn’t give them wings and superhuman strength. No, Dean, He makes sure they burn for eternity. Are you understanding this?”
Dean sighed, pacing back and forth in the room, glancing in the mirror each time he passed it and marveling at the new addition to his reflection. “How else can you explain it, Sam? A curse? A spell? Oh, I know, maybe I’m allergic to our soap!”
~
“And this,” Dean said, pointing to one of the knives on table, “is an athamé. The blade’s been inscribed on both sides and it’s been blessed. Weapon of last resort, Sam. If you don’t take the hound down with the guns, then it’ll be on you before you can blink. Try to nail it in the heart with the knife.” Well, yes, of course, Mr. Dean, sir. I will certainly try, in between panicking and being eaten, to drive that sizeable but still probably way too small knife into its heart, should a three-hundred pound, horned, possibly fire-breathing creature from Hell ever be sitting on me. And to think I once thought that finding a virgin at Harvard was a challenge!
~
“I, uh, I don’t read Latin. I learned how to pronounce it for a show I did for the Hasty Pudding, but I have no idea what it says.” 
“Here’s a thought,” Dean snarled. “Try not to perform satanic rituals you don’t understand!”
~ “Hope I didn’t call you anything nasty,” Dean replied in a carefully casual tone.
“No. You did insult my grandmother, though.”
Dean looked startled at that. “I did? Your grandmother? Dude, I am really sorry.”
~ He figured out quickly that “We’ll talk about that some other time, dude” really meant, “Yep. As soon as you notice I’m wearing dresses and high heels on a regular basis, be sure to raise the question again.”
~ Then the computer, demonstrating child-like frustration at having only murdered about 5.8 billion people, sends a Terminator back in time to take out the most annoying human before he knows how to fight back. At this point a cocker spaniel-haired waitress and then her smart-ass kid, manage to outwit the thing three different times.
~
“Any ideas?” I asked.
“Run,” Thomas said.
“Hide,” Molly said.
“Cower,” Ramirez said.
“We’ll call that plan B,” I said.
~ “You thinking what I’m thinking?” I asked Molly.
“I think so, Brain, but what if the chicken won’t wear the nylons?” 
~ She said something that should not be repeated with children present. I replied with something equally unrepeatable.
~ I had to use whatever cheap tricks I could and whatever materials I had on hand. Which meant a paper Burger King bag full of blasting powder. And some packets of condiments and plastic utensils because there is a five year old in me who wanted to see what would happen if I blew them up. As soon as they got close enough, I muttered something that may or may not have been ‘explosify’ and the bag exploded with the force equivalent to a small pipe bomb.
~
“Rzzktahzzzzi Schnzzzell Plzzzxkt,” Pinky Sr. roared. That’s a rough transliteration. There may have been more Z’s.
“Yeah, well so’s your mom,” I replied, ducking a handful of pink goo thrown at me by Junior. I mean literally a handful – he threw his hand and grew a new one. “And your sister.”
“Oh, come on!” I heard Ramirez yell behind me, followed by a series of Spanish sounding words that I’m sure were polite and wholesome.
~
As I gasped for breath while Mouse’s front paws pressed down on my shoulders, I sensed a variety of things flying over my head. Piles of goo and large sections of rock hit the ground behind me. Every single Thing in the room seemed to have focused on me at the same time.
“I told you to stay with Molly,” I rasped at my dog. Which, in guy talk, means something like ‘thanks’.
~
Thomas let out a loud roar, ripped a column out of the ground and starting beating things over the head with it. You know how, when you’re little, and you’re being bullied and you say ‘my big brother will kick your ass’, or something to that effect? You know, if you have a big brother or, as I often did, pretended to? My big brother can totally kick your ass.
~ “My getting angry is never good for anyone. Things spark and die, fires start and little goo monsters get their asses kicked. “
~ He had bruises up and down both arms, was limping slightly on one leg and had a large gash on one forearm. His face, I noted, was perfectly intact. His ability to protect that part of his body is superhuman. ~
“How many fingers?” Ramirez asked.
“Ow,” Molly said.
~ Ramirez took her coat off and made a pillow for her head. He didn’t return to the fight and considering the fact that he left a little trail of blood drops behind him, I was okay with that.
~ Mouse started his alarm bark. It sounded halfway between a howl and the honk the self-destruct sequences make in movies, with that calm sounding lady counting down. ‘Warning, 10 seconds until the apocalypse’. 
~ She was down to one gun and was showing an admirable dedication despite the lack of effect it was having. I sort of think that, in Murphy’s mind, if you shoot something enough it has to die. I can respect that belief, because how else was she supposed to be able to sleep at night?
~ Then the Stone Thing in front of me disappeared in the light and the next conscious thing I was aware of was that Michael Carpenter was looking down at me – towering from my vantage point on the floor and holding the blazing Amoracchius in one hand.
“Harry,” he said, in a calm tone, like this was something we did every day. Which, it sort of was. “Are you all right?” I started to laugh hysterically. That happens sometimes, when you’re on the brink of certain death. Michael cocked his head to one side and then decided I was okay.
~ “I know,” he said, with a curt nod.
“I didn’t –” I said.
“I know,” he said. I sometimes think that talking to Michael is like a scaled down version of what it would be like to talk to God. What would you say that He didn’t already know? ‘Nice weather we’re having.’ ‘Yes. I Created It.’
~ “A demon ate my phone,” I said. He scowled further. “You think I’m being sarcastic, but I’m not.”
~
I had to tuck my head into my coat and I ended up touching foreheads with Murphy to get the full protection from it. A shower of rocks hit us from both directions, most of the impact taken by my coat. It still hurt though, and both Murphy and I grunted a bit as the rocks hit. One pinged me in the back of the head despite my best efforts at ducking, and I could feel a trickle of blood start to run down my neck.
“Y’okay?” I asked Murphy.
She nodded, bumping her head against mine lightly. “Fine…you can let go now, Harry.”
“Right, sorry.”
I released her and she turned back to start shooting again. Women.
“How come you never protect me like that?” Thomas asked.
He appeared behind me, still swinging his column, which was half the size it was when he started. He tossed a toothy grin over his shoulder and I could see that his eyes were completely silver.
“You’re not as pretty,” I grumbled, dropping my shield briefly to try and get Pinky to back off.
“I think he might be prettier than me,” Murphy said, between shots. “Actually, now that I think about it, that’s really annoying.”
“We all know I’m the best looking,” Ramirez offered.
~ Gibbs did a double take. “They’re still eating?”
“My diet’s taking a hit just by listening to DiNozzo’s happy chewing noises.” 
~ “Bridesmaids and guests hooking up during the reception,” answered the captain, slipping the length of silk off his neck.
“I feel the need to point out that neither one of us is a bridesmaid.”
“Details, details.”
“Does this mean I’m going to have to fight Tish for the bouquet when it gets tossed?”
Buttons were being undone at an alarmingly fast rate. “Hey, if it involves wrestling with a chance of clothes getting ripped, I’m all for it. Whatever you have to do. Love this waistcoat, by the way. Let’s see how it looks hanging not on you.”
~
“Know what’s interesting about my screwdriver, it’s very hard to interfere with. There’s practically nothing strong enough...well, some hairdryers, but we’re working on that...” ~ “It’s a screwdriver. It works in the dark.”
~
“It’s a carnivorous swarm in a suit, you can’t reason with it.” “Five minutes.” “OtherDave, stay with him. Pull him out when he’s too stupid to live.”
~ “This isn’t the real me? This isn’t my real body? But I’ve been dieting!” ~ “I think a decimal point may have shifted in my IQ.”
~
“Why am I handcuffed? Why do you even have handcuffs?” ~ “Is ‘alright’ special Time Lord code for ‘really not alright at all’?”
~
“What do you think she means by a “million” kids? Two?”
~
“As is with most copper pipes,” he said, looking at her in disbelief, “it’s made of copper.”
~ Pete wonders whether Pakistan has been invaded by giant talking mushrooms again and if so, why someone else can’t deal with it? Sunday is his only day off, after all. Even God gets the day off on Sunday, but oh no, not Pete Tyler. He thinks the aliens do it on purpose.
~ Then a moment later proclaiming, “It’s not wet!” as he examined the sneaker, sounding actually delighted.
~
“Sorry, big guy. We got a case. Want breakfast?”
“What is it?” Sam said, using one hand to push his hair back out of his eyes.
“Breakfast?” Dean said. “It usually involves coffee and eggs, maybe a choice of toast or hashbrowns...”
~
“Not sure why you keep doing that.”
“‘Cause you get this look on your face like you can’t believe it just happened,” Sam said. “No matter how many times I do it, you just look like it’s the craziest thing that’s ever happened to you in your whole life.”
~ It’s not like Dean hasn’t taken care of a rabbit before, though. And OK, so Mr. Fluffy died, but rabbits die, right? They don’t live as long as people, anyway. So Dean’s pretty sure that wasn’t his fault, that it wasn’t neglect or whatever, although on the other hand, he was eight years old at the time, so really, he doesn’t know what Mr. Fluffy died of. The point is, though, is that Dean’s looked after Sam all his damn life, and he knows how to do it, whether Sam’s a four-year-old kid with questionable taste in rabbit names (oh, come on, you didn’t really think that Mr. Fluffy shit was Dean’s idea, did you? Dean totally wanted to call the rabbit Bunnytron the Destroyer, but Sam’s got this fucking face, see, and he knew how to use it even then)
~ There’s no food in the motel room, or, OK, there’s food, but it’s leftover pizza, and Dean doesn’t know a whole lot about rabbits, but he’s pretty sure that feeding them pizza is not a great idea.
~ “For Christ’s sake,” mutters Dean, and sits for a moment in the middle of the bed, because Dean Winchester is really not the kind of guy whose hobbies include chasing rabbits around motel rooms. “Come on, give me a break here, would ya?” Dean says, and lies down on his stomach, thrusting his arm under the bed, but of course Sam, little furry lop-eared asshole that he is, goes straight out the other side, and OK, Dean Winchester is really not the kind of guy whose hobbies include chasing rabbits around motel rooms, but he’s pretty sure that unless he really throws himself into this, he’s never going to catch Sam, and it’d be just like Sam to starve to death from lack of salad while staying two feet out of Dean’s reach, the bastard.
~
“I’m in a cage,” I say, and then laugh. I think I might be going nuts. “I’m pretty sure that doesn’t count as OK.”
The guy shoots me an amused glance – Jesus Christ, we’re in a cage and I have no idea how we got here and this guy’s amused -- and glances over his shoulder. I struggle to my feet, can’t straighten up properly because the cage is apparently designed for midgets or children or whatever (who the fuck designs a cage for midgets, Jesus Christ) and stumble over to the bars
~ “Something wrong with your hearing?” he asks. “Two places, I think. Don’t touch it, Jesus.” He shifts a little out of Sammy’s reach, then stares at him, sharp. “You?” Sammy shakes his head. “Killer headache. Mild concussion, maybe. Other than that—” He stops, looking at me, and maybe Dean’s kinda creepy with his totally inappropriate jokes, but Sammy is intense, and I’m kinda glad he’s in a separate cage. “David Hunter,” he says, because apparently everybody knows my name these days, which would be awesome if this was more like Cheers and less like, I don’t know, a fucking dungeon, and I shift, thinking about going over to the far corner and as far away from Sammy as possible.
~
“I’ve got a plan,” he says, and Sammy raises his eyebrows. I kinda do, too, because hi, the guy’s sitting there in a cage with a broken leg spouting about monsters, and this I gotta hear. “This I gotta hear,” says Sammy, and OK, that’s freaky. I’m freaked. “See, the problem as I see it,” Dean says, half-turning so he’s facing Sammy and wincing a little as his leg shifts, “is that the thing got the drop on us. All we gotta do is get the drop back. Be the droppers instead of the droppees.” Sammy stares at him, and Dean stares back. “What?” he says finally. “Droppees?” Sammy says. “That’s not even a word.” “So, what, you wanna revoke my scrabble privileges? Cos I gotta say, Sammy, I’m not exactly crying tears of blood over that prospect.” “All I’m saying--” says Sammy, but OK, these guys are scary as fuck and all, but they’re arguing over vocabulary for Christ’s sake and so far they haven’t actually killed me and I’m pretty sure they’re my best hope for getting the fuck out of this place, so I kinda need them to get it together, so I figure interrupting is a risk I’m willing to take.
~ “It’s a paperclip,” I say. “Damn straight,” says Dean, like that’s some kind of answer, and I’m pretty sure we’re all fucked.
~ All of the victims had been women. All had been newly married and gone on a camping trip for their honeymoon (who does that?).
~
You know how sometimes a plan goes just how you thought it would, and everything slots into place without a hitch? Me neither.
~ “That’s Bob,” I answered. When your partner is concussed, I always find it best just to tell the truth. You can always deny things again later, and it’s not like they’ll ever be able to remember for sure. “He was my teacher, and he lives in a skull.”
“Oh. That’s nice.” She looked confused for a second, then tried to focus on me again. “Did we win?”
~ She asked about Bob once, about a week after the incident while I was making our dinner in her kitchen. I took the opportunity to (accidentally) set the pierogies on fire. The following scene in which Murphy leapt into the kitchen with a fire extinguisher and a blanket trying to smother the flames on both me and the stove served as a perfect distraction.
~ “Admit it, it’s brilliant,” she said, copying his movement. “It’s Brilliance on Ice, it’s--it’s an entire spectrum of brilliance so brilliant, they have yet to think up a word for it. It’s brill-tastic.”
~ Jack leaned towards him, freer with his movements now that the blade had disappeared. “You,” he said delightedly, “have freckles!” “Do not!” Dean looked agast. “I love freckles.”
~ They looked more like Abercrombie and Fitch models, though when I observed them more closely, I could see they were both armed--they didn’t seem too worried about letting us know it, either, though they didn’t flaunt the guns or anything--and they exuded a wariness not unlike that of a ninja. If ninjas exude wariness. I’m just guessing they do. Because ninjas are stealthy and I’d think that would require wariness. You should thank me, Louise, because I’ve just deleted a whole paragraph on ninjas, because I’m pretty sure you don’t care. After writing it all out like that, I’m not even sure I care.
~
“Things have been. You know. Smuggled.” “Smuggled.” “Smuggled,” he confirms sternly, arranging the stars and clovers in an alternating row. “There’s a definite air of smuggled.” “An air of... smuggled,” Dean repeats, feeling a bit like an echo. “So what you’re saying, Sammy, is that you can- sense- smuggling?” Sammy glances up at him in that squinty-eyed kinda way he’s picked up over the last couple years, probably thinking it makes him look serious and grown-up. Dean’s not had the heart yet to tell him that it makes him look like he needs glasses- he’s saving it for a special occasion. “It feels mysterious.” “You can sense smuggling.” “Don’t make it sound so stupid,” Sammy protests
~ “Oh god,” Dean groaned, not taking his eyes off the road. “Just tell me.” “Fowler, Colorado.” Sam bit his lip. There was a moment of silence. “No,” Dean said. “Absolutely not. You’re shitting me, right?” “Nope,” Sam sounded complacent. “Fowler, Colorado, where demented chickens have taken to plucking people’s eyes out and beating the shit out of them. And 50 heads right through the town.”
~
“Jimmy, do you really think Clark’s stupid enough to leave evidence of a capital crime in his own apartment?” 
~ “…This is going to take a while, isn’t it?”
“Only if you’re a hopeless idiot.”
“… …This is going to take a while, isn’t it?”
~
“Uh, is Chris not available?” a very confused male voice asked loudly, but it was still hardly distinguishable over the talking and noise in the background. Suddenly, there was a very distinct BANG, and much swearing followed.
“No, he is quite unconscious at the moment. Could I, perhaps, take a message?” 
“Um… You’re a professor at the school, right?” he asked with something like mildly bashful thoughtfulness. At Dumbledore’s confirmation, he continued in the same tone. “So… that would make you an intelligent, experienced individual, correct?”
“Correct…” said Dumbledore, smiling but slightly confused.
“So, you know, if I had a- uh- theoretical- situation I needed-uh- theoretical help with, you might be able to offer, um, much appreciated service?” he finished brightly, even as Dumbledore heard more explosions in the background.
Dumbledore chuckled at the transparency of the lie. “Yes, I suppose I could. Theoretically, of course.”
“Wonderful!” The young man’s enthusiasm practically bubbled over the mouthpiece of the phone. “Okay, um, what would you say to three individuals locked in a- er- energy room- with a single exit, which would be- of course- blocked by middle level demons, a few Cyclopes, and- YO, DUNCAN! WHAT’D YOU SAY THOSE THINGS WITH THE THINGS AND THAT STUFF WERE CALLED? CHUPACK- CHUPACK-UHBRA? CHUPACABRA? OKAY, THANKS, MAN!- and Chupacabras?”
There was another, much closer explosion.
Dumbledore frowned quizzically. “Well, fire or bright light of some sort would take care of the Chupacabras, but Cyclopes are excellent blacksmiths, so fire wouldn’t be anything to them. Try to unbalance them; they’re quite a bit like turtles on their backs when they’re down. The demons, however, are not my area of expertise.”
“Oh, we were thinking the regular athame in the throat for them-- um, theoretically, that is. Haha. Of course. So high voltage electricity sparks would work on the Choopackabras and, um, there’s a car over there to knock the Cyclopes on their-”
“CHUPACABRA, JODEN! CHU-PUH-CAH-BRUH!” a female voice yelled in the background, sounding beyond annoyed. “AND GET THAT LEVER BEFORE THAT THINGY IT’S HOLDING CRUSHES US!”
~
“Okay, the replacing the gun with a banana was funny, like, five months ago! Who the hell has my real gun?”
~
“They told you what was happening? I mean, it’s not a top priority secret, what we do, or anything- that’s ridiculous, the idiots!”
“No, he offered me a theoretical situation, which I discussed possible solutions to. He was quite ardent about the word theoretical, I assure you.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled.
~
“What? How do I talk to her?” James asked, he’d sat up some and was looking at Harry in a skeptical way.
Harry couldn’t help the cringe, he was venturing into the disgusting, “Like you just want to shag her,” he said bluntly.
“How am I supposed to talk to her?” James was honestly perplexed.
“Wow, was really hoping for a denial there,” Harry said with a little jerk. He leaned back in his chair and really tried to convince himself that the sack of hormones before him wasn’t his father. It would have been more convincing if they didn’t look so much alike.
“No well, I like her too...” James tugged at his collar as he spoke. It was obviously less embarrassing to want to shag Lily as opposed to actually liking her.
“Well then talk to her like you like her, like she’s a friend, like she’s Sirius.”
“You want me to mock her and call her an idiot?” James scratched his head.
~
“Dark Wizards,” Frank said. “I was hoping to draw Grindlewald, something semi recent, ended up with Endend the Strange. As far as evil dark lords go...not the most interesting bloke.”
“Yeah,” Harry asked. He really hadn’t focused on the dead dark wizards, the live ones were giving him enough trouble. “What did he do?”
“Tried to take over the world, or at the very least Surrey,” Frank answered.
“He was willing to settle for Surrey?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow.
~ “I’m sure the walls rue the day they met as formidable an opponent as yourself.”
~ “Remember when the twins used Polyjuice Potion to fool her? And she thought they were two random Muggle boys from the village who came looking for a glass of water? Mum was so confused… she had no idea why the Muggle Repelling Charm had failed. And Fred and George kept asking questions… ‘What was that brown thing that just ran by? It looked like a little person!’ or ‘How did that clock know that your son was coming home from work?’”
“Remember when you and your entire family thought that when Charlie talked about Norberta, he was talking about a girl and not a dragon?” Harry grinned. “For over a year?”
~
“If a person with multiple personalities threatens suicide, is it a hostage situation?”
~
“My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She’s ninety-seven now, and we don’t know where the hell she is.”
~
“Build a man a fire, and he’ll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and he’ll be warm for the rest of his life.”
~ “I won’t say I had the toughest school, but we had our own coroner. We used to write essays like, ‘What I’m Going to be If I Grow Up.’”
~ “Means you’ll have to pull one coffin out to get to the other,” he reminded.
“Yeah, but I only have to dig one hole.” Dean sounded inordinately pleased, and Sam reflected yet again how weird their life was that double graves were a source of happiness.
~ Something smallish, shrink-wrapped and rectangular, was shoved into his hand. Sam gave it a wary shake, then looked up to about where he figured Dean would be hovering and grinning. “Gee,” he said dryly, “it’s a box.”
~ “You’ve got your knife on you, right?”
“No, I came to the haunted hotel unarmed.” He shot back, sarcastically.
~ “We could use the blade to lever enough of a gap to get our fingers in. Then we could pull from both sides and see if we can get it apart far enough to climb through.”
“Or we could snap the blade on my knife and get our fingers chopped off when the doors slam shut again. ‘Cause that would really improve the day.”
Sam glared at him.  “Alright, if you don’t like my suggestions why the hell did you ask? I don’t see you coming up with a plan.”
“I’m thinking.”
“Oh good. Remind me, how many days does it take before you starve to death?”
~
“Because I know stuff. And because I’m the oldest.”
Sam shook his head, looking slightly amused. “You do know that stopped being a valid argument when I was about eight, right?”
~ “Gwen you’re enormous!” Jack exclaims, holding her at arm’s length.
Gwen pats her bump and smiles. “Twins. Real human ones. Not aliens.”
~ Dear work, Please to be feeling the urge to give layoffs this weekend. I hate you and would really prefer not to be anywhere near you right now. Dear body, No, you don’t want a nap. Well, you do, but you don’t need one. Dear uterus, Dude! What the hell was that? What are you doing, juggling chainsaws in there? OW.
~ When his mentor gets captured by the bad guys, Neo responds by arming himself with an arsenal larger than that of most developing nations, slaughtering a cluster of security guards before they can even draw their guns, before dropping a bomb on the ground floor of the building just in case there were a few errant cockroaches that weren’t killed in the earlier carnage. Yet, for some reason it’s played so that Neo is totally free from any guilt over killing a bunch of people, instead of just generating a helicopter and grabbing Morpheus from the top floor. You know, like they wind up doing anyway.
~
This also results in a huge explosion. Why? Because it’s a Bond movie, that’s why.
~
It demonstrates that there is no profession more dangerous than being a background character in a Wachowski brothers movie.
~
“Elle, shooting me is her favourite activity—I doubt she has any interest in me otherwise.” When she spoke again, he could hear the teasing in her voice, and the grin was all to evident. “My favourite activity was electrocuting you—and we all know where that led.”
~
“And I appreciate that you’re trying to look out for me.” “I don’t need your father attacking me from beyond the grave, Claire.”
~
“Well, why not? If a werewolf bit a vampire, or a vampire turned a werewolf…” Stanford had given Sam the perspective to appreciate the absurdity of discussing vampires versus werewolves in a cheerful red-vinyl diner’s booth, over pancakes and coffee. He wondered sometimes if Dean ever saw it. 
~
“There better be a really good party at the other end of this hangover.”
~ “Behold the cavalry,” was all Rupert said. “That’s... really not an answer.”
~ “Are you over -- “ Rupert stopped. “What is the legal age in this backwater country? I can never remember.”
~
“Did she just—”
“Don’t ask,” Rupert said absently, paging through the book.
~
“I don’t disbelieve anything at this point. ‘Cause I just know I’m gonna end up being wrong.”
~ Gabriel stood. “Hey, you know, as baffled as I am by your cunning secret code, maybe I should just let you talk alone—”
~ He exuded nothing so much as sheer competence, a kind of calm inner stillness that could only mean nerves of steel.
~
“You’re not helpless, Gabriel. You’re in danger. There is a difference.”
~ “Defile. That’s not a good word--”
~
“Possible, could, may.” Gabriel took a deep breath. “You’re not convincing me here, brain trust.”
~ “She’s joking, right?” “I certainly hope it’s not important,” Rupert replied. “I haven’t the faintest idea what she just said.”
~ Spike looked at him for another moment, then said conversationally, “You’ll let me know if you need me to kill this guy, right?”
~ “Where’s the beer?” He was being stared at, expectantly.  “At the beer store?”
~ “Look, kid—” “Don’t call me that!” “Look, you virile specimen of manly adulthood,” she amended without missing a beat.
~
“What can you see?” he shouted and Dean’s head popped back through the hole.
“I see a lift shaft. What the hell did you think I would see?”
~ “Yeah, it looks safe.” he said, deciding one of them at least might as well be in blissful ignorance.
~
The fish doesn’t reply. Donna rolls her eyes. “Tell it, Donna. It won’t talk to me.” Donna does no such thing and instead takes to perusing the other random objects scattered about the console room. This had all started when he’d sat down a little too enthusiastically and something inside his coat had made a rather ominous crunching noise. They’d spent half an hour emptying his seemingly never-ending pockets trying to find the offending item (it eventually turned out to be a green umbrella complete with frog’s eyes and a smiley face. The Doctor had been distraught to find it snapped in half until Donna pointed out he could mend it with the sonic screwdriver) and another half an hour digging through his remaining pockets for a laugh. The funfair fish in a bag was the most recent discovery, hot on the heels of seven yo-yos, the Complete Works of Shakespeare, one trainer and several mouldy jelly babies.
“Aha!” he cries, triumphantly pulling out what is unmistakably, despite the alien markings, a box of fish food. “Must have been intending to keep Mr Fishy at some point, then…”
“Look,” says Donna, watching him pull a candlestick and a toothbrush out of his inner jacket pocket, “if we’re gonna keep that thing, we’ve gotta give it a proper name. I’m not goin’ round calling it Mr Fishy.”
The Doctor looks up at her, bemused. “You won’t have to go around calling him anything. He hasn’t got legs.”
~
“Time Lords,” says the Doctor, drawing himself up to his full, sulky height, “do not pout. Ooh, look, a paperclip.”
~
“So, you’re familiar with his medical history then?”
Dean grinned. “I was responsible for most of his medical history.”
~
“Superman’s alive huh?” Spider-man said as Batman entered the room. “That’s good. His last funeral was a real downer.”
~ “Maybe,” Maggie allowed, looking away.
“I’ll take that as a ‘maybe’,” Ethan said, he snapped his fingers in her direction, for a purpose Harry couldn’t determine.
~ “I don’t know, I thought I heard something.”
Dean snorted. “Lame. You should’ve gone with, ‘I had a cramp,’ or ‘I was distracted by how buff you were’ or something.”
~ Dean waited a few beats. “Is there a verb in there somewhere?”
~
“How you feeling?”
“Remember that Halloween party in high school?” he finally asked.
Dean’s mouth twitched. “That good, huh?”
~ Or maybe he’s discovered the joys of Satanic worship. I called him up yesterday to ask if I could borrow some shit and he started speaking in tongues, next thing I know my phone had turned into a swarm of locusts.
~
“Never take advice from your white friends.”
~
“You may look at my sister, but if you touch her, I will kill you.”
~ He realized Rodney was staring at him. “What?” “We are trapped,” Rodney said pointedly. “We are being held prisoner in a dungeon by an insane sorcerer who plans to torture us all for information. We are approximately one-fourth our normal size and we are fairies. And you’re fixated on what color your wings are?”
~ It took him a moment to realize who exactly they were, long enough for Ronon to step out of the shadows and pull another knife, this time from his hair. When the guard opened his mouth to shout the alarm, Ronon threw, and the guard went down clutching his throat and gagging. John and Teyla ran forward to drag the crossbows well out the injured guards’ reach while Ronon gave each man’s head a hard thump on the flagstones to knock them out. Rodney followed them out. “Have I mentioned lately how glad I am that you’re on our side?” he said to Ronon.
~ “You know what, just be glad I’m too traumatized to tell you exactly what I think of your horrible, idiotic, bone-headed, kamikaze plans.” He sank to the ground beside the tree stump. “God. I’m too exhausted to do anything right now. Even my rash is too tired to itch.”  The dragon had apparently had enough, too. It huffed a smoky breath and threw itself to the ground, making irritated clucking noises. Rodney pointed at it. “What he said.”
~ “Do you think you can make the Staff undo this fairy spell? Or are we really going to be stuck like this for the next two days?” Shooting him a withering look, Rodney said, “Amazingly enough, that is in fact just the sort of thing the Staff of Undoing is meant to do. And I refuse to spend another hour in this toxic form, so yes, I most definitely will figure out how to make it undo the spell.”
~ “And you,” he said. “Not that I don’t appreciate the proactive attitude, but since when do you attack when the odds suck like that?” She lifted a bloody, bruised face and smiled around a split lip. “Since more than one of the soldiers who entered had a key to this cell.” John blinked at her, and she pointed at Ronon, who grinned and pulled a small ring of keys from behind his back.  ~ Ronon shot him what was probably supposed to be a withering glare, but as pale and sweaty as he was thanks to the bullet wound he mostly looked like he was about to throw up. ~ John grimaced. More than he was already grimacing from the pain, anyway. “Having team colors is supposed to boost morale. I don’t think ‘our team color is red because we always get our asses kicked and bleed all over the place’ would be good for morale.” ~ As they started out Ronon whispered, “I’m not wearing team colors.” John rolled his eyes. “It was a joke. What I was trying to say was – I just meant… You know. Our team is really fucking awesome.” “You couldn’t have just said that?” Teyla glanced over her shoulder and smirked.  “It’s not that hard,” Ronon said as they stepped over two unconscious Genii in the hallway. “All you have to do is say – “ “Oh, for – never mind,” John hissed. “I take it back. You guys suck.”  A couple of months later, a red t-shirt showed up in his quarters; TEAM AWESOME was printed on the back. 
~
“Nice to meet you,” Ronon said with a distinct lack of sincerity.  Aunt Denise didn’t notice. She didn’t even look at him; she just continued to glower at John. “He looks like a terrorist. Is that what he is, a terrorist?” Okay. Unexpected. John turned and squinted at Ronon, who raised an eyebrow. Ronon had left all visible weapons in the car and was wearing a fairly nice suit and the least threatening expression he was capable of.  “Er,” John said.
“Is that what you’ve been getting up to, John Sheppard? Nobody knows where the hell you’ve been for the past four years, wouldn’t surprise me one bit to find out you’ve been AWOL overseas, probably going native. I can see that tattoo on his neck -- is that some kind of terrorist propaganda? Did you bring him here so he can steal your father’s money for his terrorist plots?” Ronon said, “She knows I can hear her, right?”
~
Rodney had, possibly somewhat hysterically, suggested breaking the guy’s legs to make him talk. It worked in those mafia movies, didn’t it? But Teyla had left him to guard the door and had sat down beside the bound man. Her tightly controlled expression of calm hadn’t wavered as she spoke softly to him, but after not very long at all, the color had drained from the man’s face and the defiant fanaticism had faded from his eyes. He had started sobbing quietly, and then told them where to find their friends. “You know,” Rodney said. “You’re probably right. I don’t want to know.”
~
“Those people wanted to eat us.” That had to be the twelfth time Sheppard had said that since their escape. 
Rodney glared at him. “Would you stop saying that? I know! We all know!”
~ “Yep,” John said. “We fell. And fell. And, you know, fell some more.”
~
Teyla turned her head and tried not to laugh through her nose. Or possibly she was clearing her throat. Teyla didn’t normally make sounds like that, so Elizabeth couldn’t really tell.
~ “Ah,” Elizabeth said. This wasn’t exactly what she had been expecting. “Well, I guess...congratulations?”  It was apparently the right thing to say, because Rodney clasped his hands behind his back and puffed out his chest. “Thank you.”
~ On the other side of Sheppard, Teyla had her face in her hands and her shoulders were shaking. Sheppard noticed, and nudged her, clearing his throat pointedly. She straightened to attention, but her mouth quivered alarmingly and tears left glistening tracks down her face. Stifling a sigh, Sheppard leaned his head down to her and said, “You may be excused, Teyla.” She turned on her heel and walked quickly away down the hall without saying a word. As soon as she turned the corner, an unsuccessfully muffled shriek of laughter drifted back to them.
~ “Are you kidding me? You actually survived going over the side of a mountain? I can’t believe you.” 
“Gee, thanks McKay. If you give me a minute, I could maybe plummet to my death instead.” 
“I just mean, you survive circumstances on a regular basis that would generally kill ninety-eight percent of the rest of humanity – hang on. Were you being serious when you said that thing about plummeting to your death?” 
~
“Give you a – okay, sure, I’ll just lie here and wait for you to maybe fall. Because writhing in the anticipation of possibly being left alone on the steeply angled side of a mountain with only the echo of your dying screams to keep me company sounds like a really fun way to spend the next several minutes.”
“Rodney, if you –” He broke off with an ‘oof,’ which was followed by a ripping sound. “ – don’t have a rope to throw to me? Then just – shut the fuck up.” 
“No. I can’t shut up. Seriously, how long have you known me?” Rodney took the risk of raising his head slightly. Encouraged by the lack of sliding, he raised it further and looked up the mountain for something more solid to hold onto than the shifting, slate-like rock beneath his body. “When I’m freaking out, I talk. When I’m angry, I talk. I’m told I talk in my sleep. I pretty much just talk, all the time, and this is absolutely not going to be the day I change my modus operandi.” Around him he saw rocks, rocks, more rocks – good god, was there anything on this stupid mountain besides rocks? “Besides, you’re the one with the rope. How stupid is that, that you have rope and I don’t? And don’t try to blame that on me – just because I refused to add an enormous coil of rope to my already copious supply of mountain survival gear does not mean this is my fault. You’re the one in charge, you’re the expert, you should have made me bring rope! Not –” he trailed off. “Not that I could do anything with it at the moment.” 
Sheppard didn’t answer, just continued doing things that involved a great deal of grunting, thumping, and dislodging of stones.
~ A ledge. Thank god for ledges, always there when you need them. Or, always there when the hero in the movie needs them, and since Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard was apparently the hero of this action flick - “A ledge. And let me guess, you survived the fall due to a handy sort of vine growing out of the side of the mountain?” 
“No.” Sheppard still sounded distant, and a little weary, but he wasn’t exerting himself any more, and the scrabbling sounds had stopped.  Rodney guessed he had made it to his ledge. Rodney let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding and let his forehead thump back onto the ground. “No,” John said. “Actually it’s more of a…shrubby thing. With a couple poofy little, I guess, flowers on it.” 
Not a vine. A shrubby thing, growing out of the side of what was probably an otherwise sheer, empty rock face. He asked, “So, how big is that ledge, anyway?” 
“Oh…you know. Big enough.” 
“For what? A jumper? A camel? A can of Coke?” 
“I’d say somewhere between the camel and the Coke. Leaning heavily toward the Coke.” 
“How much Coke? A truckload? A case?” Rodney wondered if he had a concussion. Or maybe it just easier thinking in metaphors at the moment. Or were they similes? He’d never really bothered to memorize the intricacies of literary terminology. 
“Uh, maybe a six pack. Set on its side.” 
Oh. “Oh.” 
~ Rodney’s stomach flip-flopped at the very thought of unlocking his fingers from their death grip on the crumbly incline. “That would be a no. Both of my hands are busy hanging onto the side of the mountain at the moment.” 
~ “Well,” he said. “Teyla and Ronon, they’ll find us. Soon. I’m sure they will. I mean, it’s you and me. They probably don’t even wait for us to miss a check in before launching a rescue mission any more.” 
He heard John chuckle. “Point.” 
~
“It’s right above us. I think it is, anyway. I thought it was a cloud, but it moved.” 
Giant bird. Giant man-eating bird. Wraith. No: poisonous gas creature! “What? What is it?” 
“It – well, it looks like…I guess it’s just a cloud. But it looks kind of swirly. And…like…fish.”  Silence. 
“Fish,” Rodney said. 
“A bunch of fish. Actually.” 
“Fish.” Rodney resisted the urge to gnaw on the chunk of rock jutting out in front of his nose. “We’re both one stray hiccup from death and you’re playing ‘pictures in the clouds?’ Have you completely lost your mind?” 
~ He just hoped neither Teyla nor Ronon would ask any inane questions like ‘what happened?’ or ‘why didn’t Colonel Sheppard contact us?’ or ‘alien PCP?” or anything else that indicated they were not running as fast as humanly possible in this direction, because if they did he was sure he would have to kill them. 
“We’re on our way,” was all Ronon said. Rodney slumped a little against the tree stump. Teyla and Ronon had rope. They both had rope, and they knew which direction Rodney and Sheppard had gone, and they would get here soon and rescue them. It would be better if one of them had the Ancient gene and could fly the jumper here, but Rodney was satisfied at the moment with ‘rope’ and ‘rescue soon.’ 
~ “That was,” he said weakly as he collapsed into a seat, “Obscenely good timing.”
~ Sam raised his voice. “I said you’re insane.”
Dean looked deeply offended. “What about my brain?”
~ Sam pulls at him. “You can’t hug cars, Dean.”
“‘S’like finding a long lost brother.”
“I’m your brother. You don’t even hug me.”
~
He’d heard Dean praying lots of times before, mostly when they were kids, mostly when something big and scary was on their tail. Those times, Dean had prayed very loudly and punctuated his words with very colorful, four-letter interjections.
~ “I’m sorry, maybe you didn’t hear me. Ghost in CAR, Sam! Ghost in MY car!”
Sam ducks his head. “Do you always speak with one-syllable words when you’re angry?”
~ Big thoughts. Really big thoughts. Wide open prairie. Football fields. Mountains. Endless desert. Empty highway. Cars. Trunks. Coffins.
“Shit.” Dean breathes. There’s no distracting himself from this.
~ “They used to burn hunchbacks as witches,” Sam said.  “Along with unmarried women, redheads and left-handed people,” Dean said. “One thing you can say for the human race, everybody who’s not up to standards is fair game,” Sam said.
~
“Let’s see,” Sam says mulishly, holding up a hand. “Exactly how many times have I told you not to read aloud from books that are a, old, b, in a language you don’t understand and c, in a witch’s house?”  “I thought it was a spell to make naked chicks rain from the sky.”  Sam drops his head into his hands. “Your Latin sucks,” he complains.
~
“With your grasp of Spanish? We’ll end up in some Mexican jail, repeatedly asking the warden if his wife’s tits taste like beer.”
~ “I’m the WHAT?!” Sam exploded, even as, on the other side of Dad, Dean dropped his fork and asked, “You’re making him bait?”  The silverware clattered on the countertop and Dad waited till that noise was over before saying anything. “If you’ve ever been with a girl, you better tell me now.” Sam’s mouth dropped open. He actually felt a little dizzy, his heart was beating so fast. Over by the fridge, Dean was grinning like a fool, because he liked to watch Sam humiliated or he found virginity funny or maybe he was just looking to get beat up by a very angry younger brother. Sam flopped down on the couch and crossed his arms again. “Dad,” he mumbled miserably. “I’m fifteen.” Dad was implacable: “I haul your ass five miles into the woods and find out you’re lying, you’ll be sorry.” The grin on Dean’s face was turning into a chuckle. Sam shouted, “God! Can we stop talking about this?” “What young Sammy is trying to say is,” Dean volunteered, “his innocence in matters like these is a great burden to him. And I know just the girl who can help him lift that burden --” Dad twisted up to glare at Dean, “--right after we get done with this hunt.”
~ Normally, this would be where a good brother would call the nearest shrink for an emergency appointment. Considering they weren’t even on speaking terms with normal, Dean instead started automatically flipping through possibilities: shapeshifter-Sam, possessed-Sam, haunted-Sam, influenced-Sam…
~ “Dude—” They couldn’t use names if there was any hope still of getting out of this.
“Shut up, Dean.” And…so much for that rule. 
~
“Moreover,” continued James earnestly, “Let’s assume that Padfoot, there, gave you a rather eloquent explanation of why we’ve invaded your spot of Death for a while rather than giving you that rather dull and dreadful explanation of precisely why he was not, in fact, giving you an explanation of why we are here.”
~ Walking in, he happened upon a tall, gangly man with a bright shock of red hair and a shabby looking graying man seated in his office with the impertinence and lack of decorum that the Prime Minister had come to associate with the magical community.
~ “And who is Harry Potter – an all powerful wizard that can beat this man-whose-name-never-gets-mentioned-so-I-forget? A saviour? A military mastermind? Precisely what is he doing right now?” The guests exchanged another look.
“Harry is none of those things,” Lupin wore a vaguely embarrassed expression. “He is a 17-year old boy.”
~
“No, I pulled it out of my ass. Of course, Bobby gave me the whiskey. Did we stop anywhere between Bobby’s place and this...” One hand gestured as though trying and failing to scoop a description out of the air. “...place? Bobby thinks we should talk. We owe Bobby and because we owe Bobby, we’re going to get drunk, get maudlin, and then, before your pansy ass passes out and I finish the bottle on my own, we’re going to talk. “I don’t care what you want,” Dean snarled, turning just enough to fix Sam with a glare from his one good eye. “Bobby has saved our collective asses on more than one occasion so if he wanted us to dance the Macarena in the parking lot wearing Carmen Miranda hats, we’d be out there shaking it.”“
~ “Okay.” It was a little hard to breathe crushed up against the broad expanse of Sam’s chest. “No more booze for you.” Sam tightened his grip. “Sammy... Ow! Bullet hole!” Sam switched his grip to Dean’s biceps and said slowly, distinctly, carefully forming each word: “We need to hug more.” He looked so serious about it, him and the whiskey together so sure a few more hugs would solve everything, Dean snickered.
~
“Was that tree always there?” Dean says.  Sam gives Dean a look. The tree towers over the roof, older than the school, and probably older than the neighbourhood. “Yes, Dean,” Sam says. “That tree was always there.”
~
“Maybe she doesn’t speak English.” Standing up and tossing the EMF meter back onto the bed, Dean approached warily. “No more kissy, kissy. Oh-kayee?”
Sam put his arm down and looked at his brother in disgust. “Oh, that’s brilliant.”
~
“Where the hell did you learn Spanish?” Dean demanded.
“This place with big buildings and people with books and stuff, and some of the people, like, are called professors who teach other people how to, like, speak other languages and stuff...”
~ “No reason,” Dean said, and Sam looked at him, disbelieving. “Really, I swear. Pinkie swear. I was in the neighborhood, okay? You live fifty miles from a nest of sheep demons. I figured I’d stop by first, mooch some free food and beer. And hey,” he said, holding up the beer bottle to complete his point.
~ “You know some guy in Texas died from having too many mirrors in the house.” Sam glanced up from his menu, eyes narrowing in a silent what the fuck. “What are you talking about?” “Too many mirrors. All the reflections in the house bounced off one another, turned into some kind of refracting spirit that started slicing chunks out of the dry wall. One day he got in the way, cut right through his intestines.”
~ The heater in the room was dead when they returned, so Dean attacked it with a screwdriver and a few descriptive words of its mother. 
~ “It’s just flushing the toilet. If it even is a ghost. Besides, how the hell are we supposed to un-haunt a toilet, anyway?” Dean turns around, searching for something in his duffel, and comes out again with a lighter in one hand and a brand new container of rock salt in the other. “The answer to everything can’t always be ‘burning it,’ Dean,” Sam says. Dean cocks an eyebrow. “Why the hell not?”
~
“So we’re burning the toilet,” Dean says, and waits for it. Sam sighs. “So we’re burning the toilet,” he agrees.  “See?” Dean says. “Works every time.” “You know,” Sam says, “some families, they have Christmas trees and Christmas dinners and, and presents. They don’t break into diners in the middle of nowhere on Christmas Eve and set toilets on fire. Just something you should think about.”
~
“You, uh, ever set a toilet bowl on fire before?” “We’re not setting it on fire,” Dean says. “We can’t set it on fire.” “I thought—” “We’re blowing it up,” Dean explains. “Then it’ll be on fire.”
~ Jim is a pretty fast guy. It helps that he lives upstairs from the diner, but he’s pretty spry for a man who’s got to be pushing sixty-five, and he’s pretty swift to respond when the bathroom explodes.
~ “We’re actually getting run out of town,” Sam says as Dean makes a sharp turn around an icy corner. “I can’t believe we’re actually getting run out of town. On Christmas. We blew up their bathroom on Christmas!” “I know that, Sammy,” Dean says. “I was there. They following us?”
~ “Get whatever you want. Most expensive thing on the menu, go.”  “Dean, the most expensive thing on the menu is, like, fries with extra ketchup,” says Sam, still intent on the screen.
~ “I feel like our division of labor here could have been more efficient, judging from the fact that we just both spent the whole day finding the same story.”
~ Of course, by “Metro expert” Dean means that he once rode the tourist-heavy route from Metro Center to the Smithsonian and managed to only fall into one man’s lap. So they spend about half an hour driving around just trying to find the sign for Navy Yard, and by the time they finally figure out where the entrance is, Sam’s making little huffing noises of irritation. “That’s some kinda lame-ass train imitation?” Dean asks with a smirk as he pulls into the drugstore parking lot across the street.
~ “You were all smashed against the glass,” he says. “You looked deformed. You probably traumatized children.”
~
“Because it’s interesting.” Another fast glance. “And it’s on the way.” “Way to where?” Dean’s mouth moved for a moment, trying out various lies, then grinned as he settled on the most obnoxious. “...Disneyland?” “Right. Whatever. Yeah, you know what, we do this and then we’re going to freaking Disneyland.”
~ “What did you give your niece for her ninth birthday?” His assistant asked. The Prime Minister wasn’t exactly certain why the devil this was at all pertinent in the grand scheme of things. However, he didn’t see the wisdom in arguing with someone who had a stick that could shoot things that the Prime Minister didn’t in the least understand….and considering the situation to himself, he never thought he would miss guns.
~
“Yeah well, people kept asking you how you were. Didn’t they? And it seemed a bit cruel to just tell them “Oh, he’s dead”, and I kept thinking “Well, maybe I should just work up to it, like – tell them you’d got yourself injured, and then add that it was quite badly injured, and then just say “Well, actually, he’s dead” so it wasn’t so much of a shock…”
~ “Sir, your cat – is it a familiar? Or an animagus? Or a kneazle?”
The Guard gazed at him blankly for a moment or two – he was good at blank looks – before glancing down at the cat in his arms. NO. He said carefully, in a voice usually used for speaking to the very slow and very stupid. IT’S A CAT. I LIKE CATS.
~ “I don’t get how you’ve got your hands though.” Dora squinted at them critically, “Why don’t the little bones fall off without bits to stick them together?”
The Guard looked down at his hands as though he had never seen them before, wiggling skeletal fingers for a moment before he found his voice again. I THINK PERHAPS WE NEED TO GET YOU BACK TO YOUR PARENTS.
~
“What’s that?” It is perhaps a sign you have spent too long in rat form when the object of terror you gesture to first is the cat, rather then the very small animated skeleton.
IT’S A CAT. Something in the Guard’s tone said that nothing good was coming from criticising the black and white tom who was currently eying the man as though trying to weigh up whether or not he was now too big to pounce. I LIKE CATS.
~ SOMEBODY HAS BEEN IN THE LOST PROPERTY BOX AGAIN, ALBERT.
“I blame that bloody raven, Master. It’s always hanging about. You know what they’re like for shiny objects. ‘You can always trust a raven to go thieving,’ that’s what my old aunt used to say.” Albert sniffed hard, and gave this a moment’s thought, “Mind, that was before we found the box of jewellery the cunning old biddy was hiding under her bed. Turned out she’d been swiping it for years and blaming the birds.”
It could sometimes take a few minutes to digest what Albert had said and work out what the old man had actually been talking about. IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT YOUR AUNT HAS BEEN IN MY OFFICE, ALBERT, he pointed out reasonably, AND THE DEATH OF RATS ASSURES ME THAT QUOTH IS MOST RELIABLE, IF POSSESSED OF AN UNFORTUNATE LIKING OF EYEBALLS.
~ “We old people have earned the right to be nosy by living for long enough to run out of interesting things of our own. Tell me.”
~ “You want to loose poisonous ducks on Hogwarts…Explain it again, and try to make it make sense this time.”
~
It was true. Nobody would expect trouble from a duck. But that, Atherton reflected, was because ducks were a bloody stupid idea.
~ Atherton rested his head in his hands for a moment, and tried to work out whether there was a nice way to tell your friend he had gone completely insane.
~ “Look,” he said finally. “Even supposing this could work – and I’m not saying it could – since when did this become our job? We’re Experimental Charms not Magical Weapons. We work on spells grow a better crop of wheat, or stop objects getting lost – helpful things. If suddenly we’re meant to be researching New And Exciting Ways To Kill People then I think I missed a departmental memo somewhere.”
~ “But I didn’t mean it to mock anybody.” Reynard seemed genuinely surprised that it might be taken that way, his features settling into a slight frown. “I know it’s only a duck, but I thought she might take it as a compliment.”
~
“Not even in an emergency? What if Harry calls with an international incident…again. I mean just because he’s saved the world once doesn’t mean he can tie up his own shoelaces and not trip into the Head of the American Wizengamot’s breasts.”
“We’ll discuss what constitutes an emergency afterwards. And you know perfectly well that was due to an injury and the Head of the American Wizengamot was thrilled to cushion his fall.”
~
“How is it possible,” Dean drawled, “that you can’t learn our new phone number, but you remember a tiny detail like that from a week ago? You’re such a geekasaur.” Sam gave his brother a look that would not have been out of place on a teenage girl experiencing hormonal shift. “The geekasaur was the smartest of all the dinosaurs,” he claimed, “and could hunt other, much larger creatures with the power of its amazing brain.”
~ “Well,” James observed lightly, dodging the next waves of whizzing flames easily, “Stage two has gone off without a hitch, it seems.”
“Pity stage one was unsalvageable,” growled Sirius, who was now attempting to regain the feeling in one of his legs by squirming awkwardly about.
~ “No doubt on his way to nick some mulled mead,” stated James with far less concern than Remus evidently thought such news should be received with.
~ Somehow, he also managed to free his wand arm just enough to mumble “Disobedience done!” leaving, for no perceptible reason, a dot labeled “Snivellus Snape is an oily prat” where the Slytherin dungeons had previously been displayed.
~ “Reckon we might be able to try a bit of a memory charm on them?” James whispered without much hope.
Peter’s eyes flickered for a moment contemplating this and he was about to voice his approval when Remus responded with a glance that meant he thoroughly thought he should have remained studying back in the common room this evening.
~ The great, ebony bird alighted on the table, hooted disdainfully as if it found the very wood to be offensive, and then handed Sirius the letter while nipping his finger maliciously. He swore and hissed that if his mother was capable of teaching the owl to say something like “dirty blood traitor” he was sure she would have by now.
~ As Sirius lacked the convenient excuse of Quidditch practice that James exercised regularly, he had been forced to do everything from joining the Gobstones Club for three separate intervals (After each of which he declared that he didn’t appear to have talent for the game, but might return if the need for novelty compelled him to) to scheduling impromptu dates with girls who had been quite obviously fawning over him (as he categorically avoided these girls after the fact, Lily Evans had dismissively called his behavior “disgusting and opportunistic” on more than one occasion). Detention, particularly during the last few years when their more ambitious efforts more often went awry, also afforded them quite an air tight alibi.
~ “You do that, and you’ll regret it,” she says, staring at Dean’s hand. Dean grins, because he doesn’t remember ever regretting setting fire to something, and lets the match drop.
~
So Dean’s day is going from bad to worse, and considering the bad was more like really fucking atrocious, that’s not a good sign.
~
He’s ready to start shooting some people to find out what the hell is going on. The doctors are about as helpful as a set of skis in Hell, and the nurses are shooting him looks like they’re gonna kick him out if he doesn’t stop pacing and growling (and if they try, some serious shit is gonna go down, Dean’s not fucking kidding around here), and the walls are the colour of freakin guacamole, who in God’s name thought that was a good idea, it makes Dean want to start punching holes in them.
~
“Well, you know that part they always say about not operating heavy machinery?” Sam says. “Turns out cars are heavy.”
~
Dean runs through his entire inventory of curses, invents a couple of new ones, vaguely recalls from six months spent in Texas that chinga tu madre means something obscene in Spanish, and hauls ass outside to find out where the hell he is.
~
“Dude,” says Sam, staring into the ambulance. “You kidnapped a paramedic?” Dean peers in at Manny, who’s looking a little freaked out over the top of the gag. It occurs to him that probably, faced with the same problem, Sam wouldn’t have tied up a health worker and taken him over state lines. On the other hand, he’s already pretty much established that Sam’s an idiot, so. “Yeah,” he says. “A little.” “A little?” Sam says, and he’s practically squeaking now. “How do you kidnap someone a little?”
~
“She’s got a few... parking tickets,” Sam says solemnly, like he’s just announced that she’s committed high treason.  “Parking...” Dean looks over. Sam’s watching him, his face unreadable. “Dude. I don’t think she even had a car.” Sam shrugs. “The DMV database doesn’t lie,” he says, and grins so quick it would be almost like it never happened if it wasn’t so huge.  “Huh,” says Dean, and remembers wondering what exactly Sam was doing tapping away at the laptop when he was meant to be convalescing. “Parking tickets, huh?” he says, starting the engine. “How many?” Sam shrugs. “Seventy-four,” he says.
~
“There was some sort of creep trying to take advantage of you. Fortunately, I specialize in conflict resolution,” he happily assured her, “so I didn’t feel conflicted at all about beating his ass to resolve the issue. How you feelin’?”
~
With a slow blink, Dean scratched his chest and asked around a yawn, “So, were there actually two sets of twins last night or just some really, really good tequila?” “Yes,” Sam said emphatically in answer to both questions.
~
“Always the tourist office,” James said, opening the map and then rotating it, all the while, looking at the street corner attempting to find a street sign.
“Why yes,” said Sirius irritably, walking down a cobblestone street that he swore they must’ve been down at least three times already in the last half-hour. “Let’s stroll into it and go ‘Cheers! We’re from that country over there that subjugated you for a tiny duration because some crazy Muggle had a mind to and we’re looking to get pissed in one of your fine establishments. Do you want to blow us up now or later after we’ve had a bit of a row over politics?’ Moreover, you are going in dressed like you should have been placed on a respirator four decades ago and I – well, let’s just say they might just blow us up to remove the blemish of re-introducing such Muggle clothing into the outside world again.”
James frowned, looking down at something of Lily’s father’s that he was wearing and over at Sirius’ own catastrophe of argyle and oddly colored slacks that he was now picking at, as if he half could not believe he was actually wearing it.
“We look like we’re intentionally trying to be suspicious.”
~
“Summer, Luke! A time during which jackets have no meaning! A time during which you – you banish them to the deepest recesses of your closet, never to be thought of again!”
“Which is why you’re cold.”
~ But . . . you know how normally we live in an obnoxious fantasy novel? Alec is from the science fiction version. He’s a government built weapon. Winchester DNA. But we didn’t know about him until recently.
~
“S’nice.” He blinked slowly. It was about the only movement that didn’t hurt like a bitch. “Sam?” His brain was starting to rev into gear, even if it felt like he had lead in his veins.
“Behind you.” He heard the slight squeak of Sam’s sneakers.
He tried to roll onto his back so he could see them both, but it was one of the stupider ideas he had had lately. He knew for a fact that the pathetic little noise he heard had come out of his mouth. He chose not to acknowledge the few tears that escaped his eyes. He swore. Creatively. In several languages. He ended with, “Shit, okay, so moving is out.” He watched his fingers twitch a little.
~ “You’re from America,” she commented, vaguely surprised.
Chris, however, spewed his coffee right back out and stared at her in utter astonishment. He choked, “No shit, is that what that huge land mass is called?”
~ “Looks like you’re not the slowest conveyor belt in the lunchbox factory after all, Mr. Edgeworth.” ~ Daaamn. That is just ... that’s pretty much ALL of the fail. Nobody gets any more fail for the next week and a half. We’re all out. We’re going to have to ship in fail from Asia or borrow a cup of fail from Canada or something.
~ “That’s an armadillo,” Meneas corrects.  “I thought that was a fancy wardrobe.”  “That’s an armoire.”  “Then what am I sitting on?”  “An armchair.”
~ Sam makes a face as he says, “Well done? How about we skip the whole production of you torturing poor innocent steaks to death and just eat the charcoal out of the bottom? Tastes about the same.”
~ “They’re looking forward to being grandparents, even though your father insists on referring to me as ‘The dishonorable man who refuses to marry my daughter but will sire her children’ to his friends and family.”
~
“I just need some time to sort things out, okay?”
Back to the sideways glances. “Last time I agreed to that, you almost bled out through your eyes, Sam.”
~ Peyton looked like the kind of guy who played quarterback in college and then married the homecoming queen -- blond, blue-eyed, and as wholesome as a man could possibly look in wrinkled sweats and a day’s worth of stubble.
~
Winchester proceeded to make a complete wreck of all his rock-n-roll rebel pretensions by quietly saying grace over his bacon cheeseburger with extra pickle and a side of onion rings. “Son of a preacher man,” he muttered, looking faintly defensive, and proceeded to drown his onion rings in half a bottle of A1 sauce.
~
“I’d like to say I’m sorry for you,” Reidy told him, “but seeing as how I’m stuck here wearing paper jammies and eating beige food, that would pretty much be a lie. Let me know if you come up with anything exciting, will you?”
~ Normally, his breakfast would’ve looked a lot like Winchester’s, but hearing Reidy wheeze over the phone made words like “cholesterol” and “sodium” suddenly loom large in his mind. Victor cast a longing look at the mounds of crisp bacon and freshly scrambled eggs warming in their chafing dishes, and went for the oatmeal and the whole-wheat toast.
~
“Huh? Grand Rapids, what does that have to do with any—Yes, I’m sure, you moron. You think I don’t know what city I’m in?”
~ Victor went back to his reading, but he was left with a nagging suspicion -- suspicion, dammit, not a gut feeling -- that Winchester was holding something back. Which is why he felt even less compunction that usual about searching the car the next time he was alone in it. They’d stopped for gas at a service station off I-69, and Winchester had proclaimed a life-and-death need for peanut M&Ms and ducked inside the little convenience store. Victor watched him get in line behind five other people, observed the glacial rate at which the kid behind the register rang up each purchase, and figured he had at least seven minutes to snoop to his heart’s content.
~ Victor shook his head. “You do realize he’ll never know if you don’t do it, right?” “Dude.” Winchester blinked at him with affronted incomprehension. “I promised.”
~ “All right,” Reidy said, “I’ll see what I can do. You just watch your back, all right? My doctor tells me I’m supposed to be lowering my stress levels, and let me tell you, this is not helping.” “Try getting laid once in a while,” Victor told him, and hung up.
~ “I don’t want to hurt anyone,” he insisted again. Victor thought it sounded kind of unconvincing coming from a guy who was waving a gun at two unarmed people, but he plastered on a friendly smile anyhow.
~ “Regna terrae, cantate Deo, psallite Domino,” Winchester gritted out through clenched teeth. “Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus...” Max looked as if he was entertaining serious doubts about Winchester’s sanity. Victor was inclined to agree, but at the moment he didn’t really care. If he was going to be stuck in a room with two lunatics, it was at least useful to have one of them distracting the other.
~ “Cover story. Right.” Victor gazed from side to side, trying to imagine how the scene would look to an outside observer. “I suppose ‘he tried to kill us with his brain’ isn’t going to work.”
~ “Who are you? Where’s Dean?” Apparently, the inability to hold a civil conversation when upset was a Winchester family trait.
~ “Can she really turn people into frogs?” She didn’t seem like the sort of woman who turned people into frogs, but then again Victor didn’t really know what that sort of woman would look like. Winchester smirked at him. “I dare you to ask her.” Victor decided he could live with not knowing.
~ Winchester rolled his eyes. “Yeah, you’re fantastic. That’s why you’re holding up the wall and making grinding noises with your teeth.”
~ ‘Psychic,’ Dean jumped in quickly, before Jacob could say something like ‘infected with a demonic parasite’, because really? There was no way to make that sound good.
~
“—didn’t know better I’d say you planned this,” Lee is saying, and Sally snorts at him, rolling her eyes. “Yeah, because I control the snow, Lee. I’m a weather witch.”
~
“You think I’m going to just sit here while you go up against that thing alone?” “I think you’re the last line of defence for our kids.” That stops her and she blinks at him, serious and wide-eyed.
~ The air was still humid, but the temperature had dropped from “hotter than hell” to “manageable, if you don’t move around a lot.”
~ “You’re a Neanderthal.” Sam rolled his eyes.
“Me like big tits,” Dean agreed mildly.
~ “Has anyone bothered to inform UNIT about what we’re doing?” Ianto asked. “I only ask because that gentleman over there, with all those bars on his uniform, doesn’t look very happy.”
~ “Is he regenerating for real or do I have to get the hand for him?” Before Ianto could ask what in the world that meant, the Doctor shouted a response. “Of course it’s for bloody real! Just…have to let it run its…wait,” he amended. “If the regeneration goes wrong, I’ll need some tea. Do you have that?” Gwen exchanged identical looks with Ianto, both wondering if they’d heard wrong.
“Yes, we have tea back at the Hub,” Ianto affirmed, deciding to roll with the punches. “Erm…what sort of tea would you like?” asked Ianto. “English breakfast? Earl Grey? Chamomile? Green? Barley?”
“It doesn’t matter!” the Doctor yelled, half from the pain along with irritation. “Wait…English Breakfast,” he decided after a brief thought.
~
“Should I be insulted the coffee machine leaving is getting you more upset?” Jack asked, good naturedly.
“I’m transferring the grief,” Gwen insisted.
~ Possibly it was the biased coverage, but it looked to Sam like the Fischers had owned Chapel Hill during the 19th century. Literally, if the store names in the advertisements were any indication: Fischer’s Foods, Fischer’s Fine Fashions, Fischer’s Feed Supply. Sam had never realized the alliterative possibilities of the letter F.
~
“It’s fine. I don’t need a doctor.” It was on the tip of Dean’s tongue to argue, but Sam was a stubborn bastard—wonder where he got that from?—and show was definitely more effective than tell under these circumstances.
“Catch these, would you?” Dean barely waited for Sam to look up before lobbing over a set of car keys. He almost—almost—felt guilty when Sam instinctively grabbed for them and then curled up, barely muting a yelp of pain. The nearly gray tinge to his skin when he finally glared up at Dean tipped the scales even further toward sympathy. But at least the point had been made.
“So, hospital?” Dean asked cheerfully, already slinging an arm around Sam’s waist and gently tugging him upright.
~
“Dad, can I puh-lease get a diamond-plated knife like Nina’s? I could like, totes kick ass with a diamond-plated knife. And I swear I won’t ever complain about hunting again because, I mean, I’ll have this x-core bitchin’ weap that I could carry around with me, and I would name it Diana after the huntress but give it the nick ‘Di’ like ‘diamond’ which is so perf, I mean, don’t you think? I know, I’m like a total—”
John Winchester has discovered where words go when they die. He thrust the phone at Dean. “Talk to your sister,” he ordered, “Before I go in there and beat her to death with that diamond-plated knife that we’re never going to hear the end of.”
~ He kept on polishing snowman-patterned china with total nonchalance, because obviously Kathleen Doolittle’s opinion of him was number 9,867,543 on his list of things he cared about.  Right behind gee, I wonder whether Zac Efron is single.
~ “Don’t shoot people, asshole.”
“When they stab you?  The hell I won’t.”
~ “This thing is a night demon, with claws that are all poisonous and… well, specialized.  No ER was gonna listen when I said, ‘No, don’t take the barb out.  Pour salt over it and set it on fire.  Then we can wash it right out with some holy water.’”
“You set me on fire?” I said in sudden panic, hand going instinctively to the bandage.
“Of course not,” Ben scoffed.  Then he scratched the back of his neck and said, “Maria did.”
~ “But Daddy, I want to hear,” Becky wheedled.
“I know, babe.  But what do the Stones say?”
She folded her arms and pouted like a champ.  “Can’t always get whatcha want,” she muttered crossly.
“Smart dudes.  Now come on.”
~
“Anyway.  It wasn’t a succubus,” Ben went on.  “It was a mora, which is more like a…  Like an anorexic hag who feels people up while they’re—”
“Mora are Slavic she-demons,” Sam cut in smoothly, leaning his chair back on two legs.  He continued with a professor’s comfortable erudition.  “They crouch on people’s chests while they sleep and feed on the energy generated by their dreams.  They’re similar to succubi, but mora aren’t interested in the sexual aspect.  The German incarnation—the mara or mahr—is where we get our English word ‘nightmare.’”
~ “You built a blanket fort?” Nod. “Dean, you’re thirty-seven.” Shrug. “Don’t you think you should’ve maybe found a grown-up hobby by now?” Dean thinks it over.  “There’s the naked woman in the blanket fort.”
~ Sam’s already moving, a snarl lifting his upper lip, but it’s nothing to the liquid scary speed of his father. The patient smile vanishing as if it had never been, and a fucking .357 Magnum out of nowhere, kissing the guy’s flushed cheek. “I’m pretty tired,” Dad says conversationally. “And I’m awful scared for my boy. So I’m gonna offer you a word of advice, friend. Don’t. FUCK with me.”
~ “He didn’t do anything,” Chloe responded quickly, before Lois could finish the story. She shot Lois a warning look. “Lois is done with the story. All stories related to my childhood, in fact.”
Clark had kept silent, for the most part, but now he couldn’t resist. “Really? Because I could I jump in where Lois left off -- where’d we end?” He turned to Lois as though seeking clarification. “Age nine, right? Well, I’ve got a story from when Chloe was ten –.”
~
“Counteroffer. You drop me on some random planet at some random time. ANY planet but Earth.” The Doctor looked completely baffled. “Why would you want that?” Rose lifted her chin. “Because you’d lie to me if you felt you really, really had to. If you leave me stranded somewhere, I know you’ll come back for me. If you think I’m safe with my family, you won’t. And I *won’t* spend the rest of my bloody life staring up and waiting for you.”
~ Another weird little giggle that was quickly stifled. “Sorry,” the boy murmured, stepping into the dim light. “I may have a concussion. Or I may have breathed in more of that gas than I thought...I’m not sure.”
~ “Yes, Jim, we’re serious,” the older man said at last. “We really did get married. ‘Til death do us part.”
The comment reminded her of what started this in the first place. Still a little irked, Lois growled under her breath, “You keep stealing my coffee, it will be ‘til death do us part.” The look of her face wasn’t exactly a cease-fire.
“It was my coffee, Lois, stealing it from me didn’t make it yours.”
That exchange seemed to convince Jimmy where nothing else could. Beaming, he threw his arms around both of them like a proud father. “Congratulations!”
Lois was startled into laughter before she hugged him back, glaring at Clark for the comment about the coffee. The next thing they knew, Jimmy had run out into the hallway and yelled at the top of his lungs, “Lois and Clark got married!”
“Oh, shit,” Lois chuckled, one hand on her hip as she rolled her eyes to Clark. “Well, there goes any possibility of keeping any of my credibility. Wonderful. You know what this means, right?” As if in answer, they heard Jimmy proclaim their marriage to the City room.
“We don’t have to send out announcements?” he ventured, pulling her back to him to give her another quick hug.
~ “Your sister,” he replied, shaking his head. “I think she’s been secretly hoping we’d get together.”
“Secretly, hell,” Lois snorted. “I’ve been hearing about it for the last six months.”
~
“Lucky for me I had a receipt in my wallet. With a staple. It’s a real bitch picking handcuffs with a staple, let me tell you.”
~ Dean’s reaction to that said, he hadn’t taken the time to look.  And that if he did look, and found something missing, the resulting explosion would likely be visible from space. 
~
“That’d be like summoning you by saying ‘human.’  I don’t know its actual name.”
“Rumplestiltskin,” Sam suggested.
~
“You can’t come because it’s raining? You a pussy, now?”
That made Sam flinch.  “Look, man – when they say ‘torrential downpour’?  They mean this.”
~ “Well,” said Rose, pointing outside as the Doctor came and looked out of the door, “unless when you said ‘beaches as far as the eye can see, turquoise seas and mermaids’, you actually mean ‘spooky cemetery in the dark’, this ain’t it.”
~
“A gift-wrap demon?” Dean echoed incredulously, his tone making the sentence come out sounding more like ‘Oh yeah, you’re crazy.’
Xander rolled his eyes and waved his hands wildly in front of him. “Okay, not gift-wrap, it was gurgle-rock or grilled-frog, or – something I can’t pronounce.”
~ “Mucoid,” says Dean, because awesome, and also, who the hell knew the internet was good for things other than porn?
~ He smirks, and Dean thinks about shooting the fucker anyway, but Sam’s doing that pouty-face thing, and he shoves the gun back in his pants and settles for smacking the guy in the mouth. Fucking witches.
~ He immediately felt a slight sinking feeling. “Where is it?” His tone said what did you do with it?
~ Sam stared. “Shut up,” Dean said without taking his eyes off the TV. “We came to an understanding.”
“Uh...”
“And he’s not an ‘it’,” Dean said. “His name is Tucker.”
Sam kept staring. He was at a loss. “Uh...”
“He likes to tuck his face into things to hide, ‘cause he thinks if he can’t see you, you can’t see him,” Dean said. “And it rhymes with the other thing I was calling him. So...shut up.”
~ They just looked at things very differently from people who were living a life that involved permanent residences and bills and schedules. And...laws.
~ “It’s a muffin , Sam. A common breakfast item.” 
Sam picked a large chocolate muffin-shaped item out and pointed at the frosting on top. “Muffins are garnished with, like, fruit and nuts or something. Maybe even cream cheese or just chocolate chips. Not frosting. That’s a cupcake.” 
“I don’t eat cupcakes,” Dean said with finality. “Leave it alone.” 
~ “I have a lot I’d like to say, starting with ‘what the’ and ending with fuck.”
~ “So how do we use the symbol to get us back?” 
“You were making fun of it a second ago,” Sam said. 
“I’m open to anything that gets us out of here,” Dean said. “Seriously. I’ve had fun before, and this is not it.” 
~ “That’s it,” Dean said, starting down the ladder. “Go set something on fire from the kitchen and bring it to me.” 
~ “No, I’m not high. Why would you think I was high?”
“Because the last four times you proposed to me, you were either drunk or high, and since you’ve had nothing but Perrier tonight, I went with high.” She squinted some more and reached to check his pupils. “Are you on coke? Speed? E? Something I don’t know how to pronounce?” She grabbed his wrist and went for the pulse point. “I’m not really up on the designer stuff, but if you’re going to take it, could you please let me know what it is so that I can let the EMT know what you OD’d on?”
~
“Yes. Marriage. Rings, cake, and humiliating photos. There’ll be an open bar.” He brightened at that, just a little. This was definitely not going the way he’d planned. “Me in a tuxedo and you in completely lying white? What could be more fun?” She was staring at him again. In that ‘No, seriously what kind of drug?’ way. “Oh, for... I am not on drugs!”
“You just said a wedding would be fun. Do you remember the last wedding we went to?”
He thought about it. “No.”
“Yeah, exactly.” Pepper crossed her arms and tapped her foot. “I’m still sending apology cards out for that. So, no, you and a wedding does not equate to fun in my head.”
~ “You’re not hitting him again.” Dean’s voice was low and horrible, and the sweetest thing Sam had ever heard.
~ “Dude, it’s a quick B&E, and you can’t even climb stairs. I’ll be fine.” Dean’s eyes narrowed as they looked at him. “You gonna be okay until I get back?”
He sighed. “Yes, Dean, I think the gun and shotgun and hunting knife and mace you left me will be enough to handle one guy if he comes after me again.” Dean gave him that don’t get yourself killed while I’m gone look and slipped across the street, a silent ghost dressed all in black.
~ “Well,” explained Sirius, turning a corner with a screech! and making Remus strangely glad that his negligible driving skills had managed to hold at least two wheels on the ground, “Uncle Alphard has escaped the family genes that make him an unsalvageable nutter, apparently, and has inherited some mutant strain that makes him a bit of a Muggle artifect fancier – that is a bit of a welcome obsession, howev – Damn!” He swerved to avoid a tree, proclaiming that it was one of the ones he had studied in Herbology that roams around at will in order to confuse lost witches and wizards and, in the midst of the modern metropolis, had gotten lost itself. Now, it had wandered into the car’s way just out of spite.
“‘Specially,” said James, grimacing a bit as Sirius narrowly avoided hitting a couple strolling on the sidewalk that was now shouting back several fairly unsavory, but very accurate, appraisals of Sirius’ future as a motorist, “When he had a good deal of Fire Whiskey and could no longer tell the difference between me and a Lethifold when I came through the Floo.”
~
Sirius looked back and saw that his friend’s face had now turned a dangerous grade of sea foam and, not thinking very much before doing so, yelled, “STOP!” Not one to ignore such commands, James ground the entire black mass to a stop, sending up the smell of acrid rubber as he did so. Showing an impressive display of speed, Peter managed to vault over the side of the car and vomit heartily into an available flowerpot. Sirius was laughing so hard at this that Remus was glad that no lights flickered on in the house they had so noisily come to a stop in front of to see how much their begonias were being…uniquely fertilized.
~ “It’s taken quite a battering,” said Huw. “Were you wearing this in a pub brawl?” he couldn’t help asking. Possibly one involving lions?
He looked up in time to see an amused, almost proud expression. “Something like that,” the customer answered.
~ Ianto grimaces. He hates surprises. Surprises are bastards, dressed up in ribbons, insisting they’re presents when really they’re...well, bastards. Ianto looks up from his resentful stare of Owen’s coffee table to find the doctor giving him an amused look. It’s then Ianto realizes he might have done his rant against surprises out loud.
~ “When we get out of here,” Ron said, breaking the silence, “I am going to kick Malfoy’s arse first.”
“That’s the first thing you’re going to do?” Hermione said in a half-interested voice. “Why?”
“I have a theory,” Ron said.
“Here we go,” Harry said, a faint smile tickling the corner of his mouth.
“Hear me out! You can’t shoot me down before I’ve even bloody said anything!”
~ Briefly, he cut his eyes over to Dean.  Eyebrows rose, shoulders shifted, and mouths twitched minutely.  They had a whole conversation right there in front of me, and I didn’t catch a word.  I glanced at Ben for a clue, but he looked equally baffled.
~
I made a face.  “How did you—”
“You talk in your sleep,” he said apologetically.
“That movie was fuckin’ scary,” Ben added sagely.
~ I blinked the world into focus, and with it came a lot of concerned background noise.
“Did you just faint?”
“Ben.  Not helpful.”
~ Ben froze, taking cover behind the door.  “Are you going to throw something at me?”  I shook my head, but he didn’t seem convinced.
~
“Um.”  He was fighting the instinct to mock me.  “You do realize they’re not fairytales.”
~ “So I guess this means you’re Robin. Sam and Dean must have taught you to hunt, right?”  He nodded steadily despite his skepticism.  “And now you hang out in the Bat-cave, guarding their secret identities and drinking all the beer.  And together, you fight crime.”
There was a moment of silent incredulity in which Ben struggled for words.  “Let’s back off on the painkillers, okay?”
~
“She’s like, three feet tall, and she has you both so whipped, people could dip strawberries in you.”
“You’re mixing your metaphors,” I said with a frown.  “Badly.”
“Point stands.”
“Says the guy who buys her love with Hot Wheels cars,” Dean said, scooting his queen across the board with one finger.
~
“Agh! God in heaven, do you smell bad!” The monster roared an angry response. “No, I’m pretty sure it’s you.”
~
“If I wasn’t on fire right now, I’d be genuinely impressed by that.”
~
“Shoot, I screamed like a girl.” Sue said. “I screamed like a girl. That’s so disappointing.”
~
“How about you shut up and do as I say and no one puts invisible poisonous snakes in your clothes at night.”
“You wouldn’t.”
“Invisible snakes, trained to go for your eyes. You’ll never know how many or where they are.”
~
“It’s containment protocol, Sue.”
“Don’t tell her. Tell me. My high school didn’t have blast doors or robot death bugs.”
~
“We’re ready to go. I loaded some food in there earlier.”
“Real food, or Twinkies and junk?”
“Okay, I need to lead it with some food and then we’re ready to go.”
~
“Reed, he’s sending, like, hippie zombies at us, man.”
“Yeah, and I know how. Buy me two minutes.”
“Death from above! Or, you know, mild scalding and making hippie zombies run away.”
“Reed, what the hell kind of two minutes do you call this? I’m getting overrun by hippiebots here.”
“You’ve got maybe thirty seconds before the weight of their numbers smashes the field and crushes us to death…if you needed extra incentive to stop faffing around and do whatever it is you’re doing.”
~
“I could snap your neck with my eyelid, so why don’t you explain it to me slowly or I might decide that I need some practice with that.”
~
“You’re blowing yourself up with C-4 now? Without telling me?”
“I should tell you when I want to blow myself up with C-4?”
“You-you, I’m not saying the word with my dad here.”
“I was behind the shield in there. It’s not like I was sitting on top of a stack of the stuff when I set it off.”
“Don’t you try and be logical with me and twist my words like that.”
“But…I needed to test my tile for heat and impact tolerance…”
“Johnny, will you beat my boyfriend up for me?”
~
“Are there, like, invisible daggers hanging over my head right now?”
~
“Young man, I am going to drag your scrawny little body and experiment on you until I figure out how to make you die. I am a scientist. I can do that.”
~
“I can ground you until you’re thirty and keep you in the basement away from boys. It’s the law.”
“No, it’s not.”
“How would you know? I’m a very important scientist and I know everything. Now go to your room.”
~ “I turn invisible and I have a bulletproof force field. I’m Ninja-Girl now.”
“That should be your superhero name. Invisible Ninja- Girl and the Human Lighter. Plus, Mr. Candy Floss and The Rockpile that Smells Like a Sick Buffalo.”
~
“So, what’s your insane plan?”
“My Insane Plan: We have one of the space shuttle decommissioned early…”
~
“What is that thing?”
“It fired plasma at you. Soft mass of superheated gas. You can’t use bullets in space stations. And, honestly, physics are so weird here that a bullet might go too slow to hurt you anyway.”
“What is that thing?”
“It shoots hot stuff.”
~
“We have their trajectory! You will do as I say or I will come to your house in the night and steal your heart, lungs and children for the War on Terror. You will fire the nuclear air raid siren in Las Vegas now!”
~
“What’s all the noise for? I wake up on my butt, Ben’s taken my clothes off and painted me with soot, we’ve landed and no one’s—huh. Fight scene. Okay…I’m nuking alien guys with big guns. I don’t know who they are or where they came from or why I’m in Las Vegas. This rocks!”
~
“I agree to One. Simple. Test. And you trash a space shuttle, wreck Vegas and reveal yourselves to the public in a way we cannot hide or go back from—and for what? For what, Mr. Richards?”
“A hand-held death ray, General. From the aliens. Pretty easy to reverse engineer and produce.”
“I love you, boy.”
~
“Do you want a cup?” a chipper voice asked. “The pot is still fairly fresh.”
“You’re not going to suddenly materialise out of the walls, are you?” Martha asked, momentarily unsure.
“Does that have any bearing on the actual question?”
~ “Yes, yes, thank you!” Martha crowed, giving him an impulsive hug. “I knew you’d think of something!”
“Well, if this is the reaction I get every time I have an idea, no wonder I’m fond of you,” the Doctor said.
“Come on, let’s go!” Martha said tugging at his arm.
He raised a finger “Just one little point,” he said.
“What?” Martha asked impatiently
“You do realise you’re still in your night robe, don’t you?” Martha gave him a dirty look. “Straight ahead, third door on the left,” he said, with a smile. “And while I wait, I’ll see if I can’t come up with a better story for our return than and I decided to pop in to see my dear cousin Oscar, at four o’clock in the morning, and bring him back home with me.”
“If that was meant to be an impersonation of me, I wouldn’t give up the day job,” Martha carolled over her shoulder as she ran for the wardrobe.
~ The Doctor raised an eyebrow. “The cellar, you say?” he asked.
“That’s almost too obvious, isn’t it?” Martha asked.
“I’ve always found it best to never underestimate the obviousness of one’s opponent,” the Doctor said, as he produced a roll of velvet fabric.
“I thought that was, never underestimate the intelligence of your opponent,” Martha said dryly.
“That too, although you might be surprised at how rarely I get the opportunity to use that adage,” he muttered, as he bent down in front of the lock.
~ “Martha, I think the situation might be a bit more dangerous than I originally envisaged.”
“And this would be news?” Martha asked rhetorically.
“Well, alright, when I say a bit more, I really mean a lot more. I think you should stay here and–”
~ Martha stood on her toes. “What? What do you see?”
“Danger and derring-do,” he said lightly. “Tell me, have I mentioned the chronon levels yet?”
“The what?”
“And I suppose that answers that question,” he said. “Well, you see, a chronon is a quantum unit of time, approximately two by ten to the power of minus twenty three seconds and–”
“Uh, Doctor, danger and derring-do, remember? Cliff notes version, please.”
He looked at her, puzzled. “But that was the cliff notes version,” he protested.
“Well, stick to the Oxford dictionary,” Martha said, impatiently.
“Concise or abridged? Well, I’m only asking because the concise version doesn’t actually have a definition–”
“Abridged, then.”
“Ah...”
“That doesn’t have a definition either, does it?”
“No, I’m afraid not - tell you what, why don’t I just tell you I’ll explain later, and we’ll skip onto the next part?”
“Which is?”
“The part where I tell you to look behind you.”
~
“Yes, I know, it’s a bit of a cliché, but I usually find that these matters boil down to one of two things — world domination or…or where is my mummy?”
Martha stared at him. “You’re cracked in the head, you do know that?” she said.
“You don’t believe me?” he asked. “I’ll wager a fiver I’m right.”
“Let me get this straight,” Martha said. “Not only is your future self being held hostage by the HAL from hell, but he also has a great, big, ruddy metal rod thing sticking out of his head... and you want to lay bets on the robot’s motives?”
~ Raph huffed. “You’ve made things difficult for me. You have to understand, my mission is more important than the lives of two people.”
“Not to me.” Gibbs cocked the gun and leveled it at the back of Raphael’s head.
The spy might not have seen the gun, but he definitely heard it. His hands froze on the keyboard. “You would shoot me?”
“I will. And I’m only counting to three.”
“Jethro,” Fornell warned nervously as he entered the room. “do the words ‘international incident’ mean anything to you?”
“One...” Gibbs counted.
“This is important! I have to...”
“Two...”
“Fine. Look in the wine cellar, there is a rack across the door at the end of the room, now please!” He turned to offer Gibbs the key but he was already disappearing out the broken door.
“Hey Raphael?” Fornell moved forward with a mischievous grin. “Gibbs’ people back-doored that system two days ago. They broke the code last night.”
Raphael sputtered in disbelief. “What did they find?”
“Oddly enough they foiled a plan to blow up the J. Edgar Hoover Building. But thanks for all your help. I’m sure you would have found it. Eventually.”
~
“Laying down on the job, DiNozzo?”
“Hey boss,” Tony greeted without opening his eyes, hoping his voice was falling somewhere in the range of human hearing. He was almost sure his lips were moving. “Can I go home now?”
“Hospital first,” Gibbs told him as hands gently began to check him out. So either Gibbs really could read minds or the words were actually coming out of his mouth.
“I can work with that,” Tony muttered. At least he thought it really, really hard.
~
“Come in! Please, dear God, come in,” Tony answered the knock on his door as he raised the bed to its fully upright position.
“Hey, look at you,” Kate greeted as she entered. “It’s about time they moved you out of ICU. They wouldn’t let anyone but Ducky and Gibbs in to see you.”
Tony laughed and hid the particularly racy skin mag he was perusing under the blanket. Kate didn’t need to see it or he’d never hear the end of it. “That’s only because ‘Doctor Mallard’ claimed he was my private physician and Gibbs flashed his badge and threatened people.”
~
“I thought I’d lost you forever,” he cooed to the toiletry bag as he cuddled it.
“I thought his head injury was better?” Gibbs asked McGee who merely shrugged.
~
“Yeah. And you know... they’re really mean in the hospital. This blows all my nurse fantasies right out of the water.”
~
“Since you are being stalked we thought it prudent to provide an around the clock guard for the rest of your hospital stay.”
Tony sighed and leaned back against his pillows. “So who’s really being punished here, him or me?”
“You’re right, he is quick,” Fornell said to Gibbs. “Come on, DiNutso, I understand you are uniquely qualified for this mission.”
Sipping his milkshake, Tony took a moment to contemplate. He was bored after all. A project might be just the thing to keep him occupied. “So do you want him to quit or just burst into tears every time somebody mentions NCIS?”
~
The door burst open and a dozen black balloons were shoved through it. “I can’t stay long, I think Gibbs might be on to my little hospital excursions...” Abby started before the balloons drifted to the ends of their strings, high enough for her to see her audience. “Hi, Gibbs.”
~ “No, I enjoy meditating in her nest holding this meat stick,” Gwen snapped. “Of course I’m trying to feed her. Ianto’s not here to do it.”
~ “We should name a building after her,” Jack announced halfway through the dinner. “We could do that. It’d take just a phone call.”
“That would be a gross misuse of power,” said Ianto.
“Hi, have you met us? We’re Torchwood.”
~
“You bought my aunt’s house?” Ianto gaped at him.
“Yup. But now I’m having some intense buyer’s remorse.” Jack strode across the street to the front of the house and turned, spreading his arms. “I mean, look at it. It’s a great house, but what am I going to do with it? When am I actually going to live here? So I was hoping to fob it off on you,” he finished, holding out the keys.
Ianto stared, not taking them. “You bought me a house?”
“I was always a sucker for old houses. Real estate agent told me two generations of a family grew up here.”
“You bought my aunt’s house…”
Jack chuckled. “Yeah, I think we established that.”
~
Dean cocked his head to one side. “I always kinda liked the word ‘foreboding’. Has a cool we’re-all-gonna-die sound to it.”
~ Reed may look conflicted in the picture, but you just know that in the back of his mind he’s going “Excellent! My calculations regarding the Vegetomatic Tranfusor were spot on! Truly, this a glorious day for science!”
~ Roy smiled. “I’ll keep my com-link open. Listen, learn… and get ready to move in if I have to switch to Plan B.”
So saying, he exited the car and slammed the door shut on Tim’s plaintive, “you haven’t even told me Plan A, yet!”
~
“Dangerous in the wrong hands?” Stark glanced coolly over before returning to the imagery only he and Allison were cleared to see. “Okay, so just an all-around kinda dangerous, great.”
~
Once upon a time, there was an episode of Justice League where we discovered the League consisted of seven people who kinda hated each other a lot, and kinda wanted to shag one another, and were generally not pleased to be together. There was a telepathic ape involved. Really.
~
“But I was sitting at home the other morning ... doing the same thing I do every week ... which is watch my shirtless neighbor mow his lawn ... with binoculars ... and it suddenly struck me that it was kind of gay.” Kon rubbed the bridge of his nose. “Probably, yeah.”
“So, I kind of decided to try gay sex ...” “Please, Lord, I don’t need to hear this ...”
~ Aunt Rachel sent a giant box of comic books. When Jeffrey came home on vacation from the military school that was an attempt to iron the burgeoning criminal element out of him, he was absolutely furious to discover that his mother had given away his really quite valuable collection. He smashed four windows and robbed the corner newsstand to express his displeasure, and ended up spending the next eight to ten months in juvenile detention.
~ Henry shrugged in response. “Sure.” He looked at Jack. “Just... try not to touch anything.” “Hey!” Jack said, affronted. “That accidental satellite launch? So not my fault.”
~ Scenario: Two-Face has taken Fire Chief Anderson hostage at a Thursday matinee at the Princess Theatre. Two-Face has three male accomplices, all unknown. Anderson and Two-Face are on the stage, accomplices are blocking exits. Describe how you will achieve the following: a) ensure safety of Chief Anderson and theatre-goers, b) apprehend Two-Face and accomplices, c) minimize property damage, d) remain uninjured. Prioritize in order given. List materials used, describe deployment, estimate worst and best case scenarios, and develop contingencies. Use essay format. “Assume success,” says Bruce unencouragingly. “Describe how it’s achieved.”
~
Most of the time the villains in Gotham are scary. Real scary. But sometimes they’re morons. Like sticking your feet on the floor of a theatre. Sure that’s poetic in ways, I appreciate the irony, but come on – all I have to do is take my feet out of my stuck-to-the-floor shoes and jump over the rest of the gunk. Presto. Doesn’t take too long for people who actually know what they’re doing to figure it out too and join me. And hey, while the Royal Flush Gang has their moments, it’s not that scary when it’s five to eighty. Even if we all are barefoot. I could swear Batman snorts when he finally shows up and I’m beating Ace with a chair (along with six other people, but still).
~ After the Clench I carried a gas mask. After the Earthquake I stored away bottled water and preserved food. After No Man’s Land. I took a few self defence classes. Make that a lot. I didn’t used to have to worry, after all Gotham’s scary, but so are my six older brothers. After the Clench there were four. After the Quake three. After No Man’s Land, Rico’s all I got left and he’s still in a coma. So I don’t understand why someone would try to mug me. In Gotham. On the way back to the hospital and not expect a taser in the ass. What I didn’t know was that the guy had already mugged three people on the way to mugging me. They were pretty pissed off too. I let them borrow the taser.
~ When the Bat appears, it’s the little one, the girl, and she takes one look at them and laughs so hard she falls off the building. “I think I just sent a minor plummeting to her death,” says Gordon. He sounds grimly resigned to this, but the Batgirl crawls back up, hiccuping with laughter, and wordlessly accepts the files Gordon hands over. 
~ “It appears to be a police box from the 1950’s. Why on Earth did you summon a 1950’s police box?” He asked me. “I didn’t,” I said. “Are you sure? Remember that grandfather clock you accidently - “ “I was twelve,” I objected. “And I sent it back.”
~ “Are you here to hire me?” I asked. “Because I have a door.” I pointed to it. “You didn’t have to bring your own.”
~ “This is my office,” I said, feeling the need to put that out there. “You’re in my office.”
~ “Time travel is illegal,” I said. I needed an argument and that seemed a good one. “It’s against the Seventh Law of Magic. ‘Thou shalt not...’ something something to do with not time traveling.” “Swim against the Currents of Time,” Bob filled in. “Right.” “I have a license,” The Doctor said. He flipped open a wallet and showed me a blank piece of paper. “See, Licence to Swim Against the Currents of Time, assigned to the Doctor, plus one, signed by the High Council of Wizards, 1312 AD.”
~ Lois then responded with solicitous concern as to whether the woman had been able to find good child care again after that unfortunate incident with her husband and the Slovenian au pair. Honestly, why anyone thought they could win a bitchy-remark contest with Lois Lane was beyond her.
~ “Now how do you like that? I ask about your wife, you ask about my assistant?” Tony deflected the question. “Oh, I’m sorry. Should I have inquired after the latest string of one night stands whose names you can’t remember instead?” Nathan asked a little too sweetly. “Based on the cattiness of that remark, I have to assume you’re still estranged.”
~ “What’re you doing?” he asked, because maybe the obvious was too obvious to be true.
“Planning a heist,” Zoe replied. “I’m thinking of using a giant robot as a getaway car.”
Jack thought that over for a second. “Okay, I don’t know if that’s actually possible or not, so—”
“Calculus, Dad,” Zoe said, looking up from her books with a frown. “I’m catching up for midterms next week.”
“Ah.” Jack nodded, and strolled back to the table and peered at her books. He chuckled. “Looks like—”
“It is Greek.”
~
“He blew up half of the second wing and transported the lab’s rat specimens half an hour into the past.”
“Cool.”
“Except for the part where it created a weird kind of loop, so that eventually we were overrun with rats from the past and rats from the present and we made Fargo dismantle the machine before he even made it,” Nathan said, even as he started to laugh.
~ They turned to face Henry Deacon, physicist, engineer, current head of Global Dynamics, and officially ordained Internet minister, who began with “Dearly beloved...” and went on to say what Jack was sure were a lot of wise and insightful things about love, marriage, the universe and everything which Jack completely missed because he was too busy getting over the realization that he really was about to marry the smartest and most beautiful woman in the world. He tuned back in for the vows, though, so he caught the “I, Allison, take thee, Carter...I mean, Jack...I mean, take thee, Jack Carter...” which he never let her forget about until the literal end of time. It was also the very last part of a wedding ceremony that was months in the planning, because the split second after she said it, Jack’s phone rang. And Allison’s phone rang. And Henry’s phone rang. And several phones in the audience rang. And the church began to fill with a low rumble of panic and muttered cries of “Fargo!”
~ According to legend he didn’t realize he had run aground until his supply of Chianti ran out. Reportedly it was another few months before it dawned on him that the island might not be India.
~ Dean didn’t move. “Is this because I wouldn’t let you visit the Grand Canyon? We have to sightsee in Death Valley to make up for it?” “Oh, we’ll visit the Grand Canyon someday. You’re not getting out of that.” “I’ll push you into the Grand Canyon some—” Dean’s grumbling was cut off by the sound of Sam’s phone ringing. “Whoa. You get service here?”
~ “I feel like I’ve been eaten by a field of dandelions,” he said, shaking his head and looking around. The elk above the fireplace did not respond.
~ Sam let out a high-pitched noise that pretty much proved Dean’s my-brother-is-a-big-girl theory and began to flail wildly in the drifts. Dean flinched away from the flying arms and legs, shoved Sam back down as he tried to sit up, and sat heavily on his chest.
~ When David started to speak again, Sam held up his hand. “I know you don’t believe it. I know you think we’re crazy. And you know what? I don’t fucking care. I have no idea what’s going on, but I do know that it’ll be a lot easier and everybody will be a lot safer if you just shut the hell up and do as I say, because no matter what’s happening, you are way out of your league here, okay?”
~
“This sucks out loud,” Dean said. He punched the mattress. The elk was unimpressed. “Yeah, easy for you to say,” he went on. “You’re already dead and stuffed.” Stubbornly, the elk refused to blink or look away. Dean added, “I like venison.”
“Who are you talking to?”
~
“Meat is murder,” she said, wrinkling her nose. Gary sucked air between his teeth. “Tarah. Do you or do you not have hamburgers here?” “Yeah,” she sighed. “Then get me a murdered cow on a bun, okay?”
~ “That’s what I said. A dilly-taunt. Is that a bad thing?” She wrinkled her nose in a thoughtful manner.
Bruce laughed. “Not exactly. It means I play when I should work.”
“Oh.” Her tone made it clear that she thought this was a completely logical thing to do.
~
“I do have twice the grey you do. But unlike you, I embrace artifice without reservation. Next week I think I’ll be a redhead.” Sophie made a noise deep in her throat. “Glad you approve,” he said.
~
“In the beginning,” Aziraphale intoned, “there were probably ducks.”
~ He tried to remember Adam naming ducks ducks, but couldn’t do it. He remembered a finger pointed in his direction and a shrill voice shouting “Snake! Snake! It’s a snake!” and he remembered thinking alright, so I’m a bloody snake already, we get it, move on, but that was about the limit of his recollection.
“That’s precisely what I mean, dear boy, don’t you see? We don’t remember ducks, they’re far too ubiq...unbin...ubink...common, aren’t they? But there were probably ducks. Ducks are always probable. They’re dependable that way.”
~ “What I mean to say,” Aziraphale continued, “is that ducks don’t need to have always existed in order to give the impression that they have always existed. That is the genius of ducks.”
~ Due to a series of events that was abnormal even by wizardly standards, Sophie had given birth to her son while transformed into a cat.
~ “How do you know I made it up?” he said defensively. “Pendragon might well be my middle name!” 
She gave him a look that said no one who knew Howl at all would ever have any doubts that he had personally selected the name Pendragon for himself. (Michael had pretty much the same look, though he was obviously trying to levitate himself invisibly back up the stairs.) “No person in their right mind would ever name their child Pendragon.”  “We’re naming our first son Uther!” Howl informed them all spectacularly, which was probably very close to the worst possible time to announce this.
~ The next day all the fancy papers were gone, and Howl ate the pear, saying with manful enthusiasm, “We will not have roaches.”
~ She had a horrible, growing fear that he was ordering an elephant from the desert countries to the south and she was going to be expected to ride up to the altar on its back and stand before a holy man in a chapel made entirely of gold-plated milk chocolate.
~ ‘Now, are you all feeling a bit better?’ Aziraphale asked solicitously. 
The shepherds clung together and made noises that he thought he should interpret as assent, given that time was getting on. 
‘Good, good,’ he said cheerfully. ‘Ahem. Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.’ 
They gibbered a little at him, and he gave them an encouraging smile. 
‘It’s an angel!’ Ya’akov shrieked, and fainted again. 
~
“Have another drink, then,” Aziraphale said. “And then we’ll put on some cheering music and call out for -- what will they deliver, here? “Pizza,” Crowley said. “And also pizza. And Chinese, but you have to put up with it tasting a bit like pizza.” The young man who delivered roast duck, risotto, and slices of chocolate torte an hour later looked a bit confused, and as though he couldn’t quite understand why he’d left the restaurant, piled hastily wrapped boxes in his car, and driven across town in the rain. Aziraphale gave him a nice tip.
~
“You bastard!” he shrieked. “You tricked me into celebrating Hanukkah!”
~ “And we do Christmas too, and to my specifications.” “Which are?” “Unabashedly pagan,” Crowley said with satisfaction.
~
His microwave, like his fridge, had never been plugged in. This didn’t prevent it from heating food perfectly in just under a second. As Crowley had never bothered reading the box past “oven” it also browned, crisped and baked to perfection. In the mornings, if he wasn’t paying attention to what he was doing, it sometimes also found itself making toast of a perfect golden-brown colour.
~
“First, buy a stepladder.” From his unstable roost atop a stool, atop a chair, atop a table, Linus glared down at him and leveled the pliers in a menacing gesture, or an attempt at one. The entire rickety structure rocked as he did so, and he regained his balance with a faint yelp.
~
Carolina pauses. “Oh, fuck no.” She’s met John Winchester a grand total of two times. Two times too many. The first, she helped him. The second, she punched him. Should’ve just punched him the first time. It’s one of the great regrets of her life. Right up there with not investing in Yahoo and that tattoo on her back.
~ Jess smirks. “Just wait until they get probed.” He makes a face. “You had to say that.”  Her smirk widens and leaves her studying behind, pushing up out of the chair. “Sam, my boyfriend chases little green men for a living. If I didn’t make that joke at least once a month, I’d never forgive myself.”
~ Nathan groaned. “Aliens caused that?” “Uh, sort of,” Chloe agreed. “There might have been a little attempt at world domination.”
~ “Have you ever done a lap-dance in a seedy bar in the back streets of San Francisco?” Jo’s head tilted slightly to the right, she leaned back on her heels, and crossed her arms across her chest. “No, I haven’t. And, neither have you. Because, if you had, then your father would have tracked down the lap in question, and removed the owner’s chances of siring any children for a decade or more, and you would’ve told me about it before this.”
~
After two hours of maintaining his careless sprawl across the couch, Crowley abandoned it and sat up, scowling. No fruit seemed to be forthcoming. Aziraphale was undoubtedly attempting to spite him. He was probably waiting for Crowley to bring the books back, operating under the assumption that Crowley had a shred of decency buried somewhere deep inside him and would begin to regret his actions sooner or later.  Which Crowley did not and would not, of course.
~
“Do these blasted birds never die?” Crowley snapped as he thumped down onto the bench that Aziraphale had claimed. It had been several years since the last time they’d sat together on this bench, but it might as well have been the previous afternoon for all that things had changed. An elderly drake who looked exactly like the elderly drake that Crowley had been attempting to drown for what seemed like centuries floated placidly near the shore, belly suspiciously round. He was undoubtedly full of pastry, as Aziraphale had a shredded danish on a napkin spread across his knee.
~
They listened to Crowley’s favourite mixed CD on the ride to his flat (a soundtrack of insanely rich artists all singing about their childhoods in poverty, illegally downloaded off the internet) which was one of the few things that could be left in the car without becoming a Queen album. This, Crowley felt, was due to the fact that the music currently playing was far far worse than anything Queen had ever manifested, and therefore it needed no alteration.
~
“You,” Crowley said, pointing to a place where the angel wasn’t, quite. “You. You.” Aziraphale blinked at him, then looked around. When he met Crowley’s gaze again--well, when he looked at his own reflection in the dark shades--he seemed surprised to be the center of attention. Who else would I be looking at? Crowley tried to ask. What came out was, “Mphgumph.”
~
“If he does remember us, he’ll probably try to smite us. Probably got a sword. A good sword. Real Toledo steel. Dipped in holy water and. And.” He tried to remember something that the angel really hated. “And raspberry vinaigrette,” he said triumphantly. “Positively dripping with raspberry vinaigrette!”
“He’ll remember,” Aziraphale said, tranquil as a summer day.  Tranquil summer days always made Crowley want to kick things. He scowled and the car, now painted in a glossy, blood red, the kind of blood red that suggested an artery bleeding itself out, shuddered around them and went faster. Much faster and it’d break the sound barrier, Crowley thought, and he pushed a little more. There was a satisfying BANG and the angel looked at him with disapproval. The angel always looked disapproving when Crowley drove. Sometimes, he even looked disapproving when Crowley was stopped.
~ CAN I HAVE THEM? Death asked. If a being such as himself could be said to sound hopeful, he would have. Instead he mostly sounded rattly. Adam looked at the angel and the demon, his head cocked. “They’re your cousins and therefore out of your league, I’m afraid.” DAMNATION. “Out of that league, too,” Adam said.
~
They’d flipped for whether this room would be his studio or her bedroom, and he’d lost because she’d taken Judo for seven years and he didn’t like to get beat up by girls, and then he’d moved his art supplies in anyway.
~
Nathan was going to kill someone when this was all over. He didn’t know who just yet, but he knew it would be someone. Maybe General Landry, for agreeing to this stupid mission in the first place, maybe Colonel Mitchell, for insisting that they split up, or maybe just Fargo, since he was the best kind of scapegoat.
~
“We call it a demolecularizing multiphasic teleportation beam,” said Zoe, glaring as she imitated Rodney’s snide tones. “Especially when we get stuck writing book reports on it. God, I’d better get a late pass for being beamed to wherever I am.”
~ “A misspent youth, sir,” said Alfred. He held the gun carefully, still pointing it downrange. “In which there was a surfeit of free time and an excess of available ammunition.”
~
“Good morning, sir. I have brought your breakfast. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and you are tasked with running a multinational corporation on only two and a half hours’ sleep. I don’t mean to cast aspersions on your job performance, but I have instructed my broker to sell Wayne Enterprises short.” ~ “No, Master Dick, I’m quite certain she does care, and -- oh, excuse me, sir. I believe that you instructed me to warn you on those occasions of your becoming, as you say, ‘emo.’”
~ Another paper, another screaming headline. They were using their two-inch, apocalypse-caliber typeface, Sam noted with a sigh.
~ This had been followed by the usual inane – at least, in Dean’s considered opinion – round of “I can’t believe it!”, “What are the odds?”, “You look great!” and the ever-popular, “What have you been doing with yourself?” Of course, the correct answer for Janet Thurman would have been, “I’ve been getting turned as a vampire and I’m busy setting you both up now to get captured by Luther, tortured and then eaten.” Had she said that, Dean was pretty damn sure neither he nor Sam would have taken her up on her offer to use her family’s cabin, just one town over.
~
“Geez, Dean, what happened to you?” Sam knelt by the two-seater, giving Dean a critical once over, checking for other possible injuries.
“Before or after the edge of the ravine turned into a mudslide, I ended up in a river of mud and a tree fell on me?” Dean asked testily.
Sam’s lips twitched but he was pretty sure outright laughing would result in more than just the glare he was receiving now. Sam decided Dean could not be too badly injured if annoyance at his younger brother was his predominant emotion.
He changed tack. “Dean, a golem? How?”
Dean rolled his eyes and huffed exasperatedly. “Weren’t you listening just now? I landed in a ravine full of mud!”
~ The Doctor looked at her meekly. “Well, I mean…. maybe…. possibly…. Oh look! The elevator!”
~ “Probably kicked me when I was out,” he said ruefully. Then, wincing at the sharp pain, added, “Several times.”
~ “Bruce happened,” Lois said. “He stole my tape recorder.”
“Actually,” Clark motioned at the pile of knick-knacks that had been in Lois’s purse. “He bought it. There’s five hundred dollars there that wasn’t before.”
~
After what he remembered as “The-Day-He-First-Got-Really-Really-Bad-Cooties”, Harry was seemingly very nervous around girls.
~ “Big experiment, I’m assuming. Something hopefully disfiguring...”
~ Five seconds later, he was banging the bathroom door open. “You jerk! You sewed my bag shut?” Dean started laughing behind the shower curtain. Sam glared at the opaque barrier, then slowly smiled. He reached over and flushed the toilet before backing out of the room. Dean’s yelp was very satisfying.
~
Sam looked into the pond. There was a….a fish talking to him. This was the most interesting head injury he’d ever had, that’s for sure.
“My name’s Harvey.” Oh good, my delusion has a name. Dean’s gonna love this.
~ “No,” Jack said firmly, waving a hand.
“You’re gonna have to be more specific,” the young man said. “No sparkles? No sequins? Gimme something to work with here.”
“No, you do not have wings.”
“I’m pretty sure he does,” Stark said.
“Not helping!”
“Do I ever?” Stark asked.
“Point.”
~ “I was deep undercover for the NIA,” Dean lied easily, sitting on the nearest bed and picking up a pair of worn socks from the floor. “By ‘killing’ me they were able to pull me out without blowing my cover.”
“Bullshit,” Morgan scoffed.
“Alrighty then,” Dean said with a smile. “You explain it.”
Morgan turned to Gideon who took a deep breath. “As near as I can tell Dean died and went to Hell where Sam here,” Gideon said with a gesture to the younger Winchester, “Who has abilities yet to be disclosed, brought him back to life through some sort of incantation.”
Sam shrugged sheepishly as Morgan turned to glare at him.
“So nobody is going to tell me,” Morgan complained as he pulled out his phone. “I guess we can hash this out in interrogation.”
~ With a small squawk of surprise that he would later deny, Harry ducked and spun to see the incoming opponent.
~ Madam Fatal was Murder She Wrote in the 1940s if Murder She Wrote involved more criminals getting punched in the face by an octogenarian lady. So it’s more like that episode of The Golden Girls where Bea Arthur has to rescue Sofia from the Mafia using only her muscular, mannish body and her experience as a female wrestler (it is entirely possible we dreamed this episode).
~
I hate the gymnastics commentators as much as I love Michael Phelps’ shoulders. The only thing I hate more than the gymnastics commentators are the diving commentators. The only thing greater than my hate of the diving commentators is my love of Michael Phelps’ hipbones.
~ “What the hell kind of word is ‘erosion’? You just don’t use words like that in I Spy!” “It’s a word and I can see it. It’s happening all over this graveyard.”
~
“I’ve got an entire room with no defined purpose. I could fill it will cornflakes if I wanted.”
“I’m not sure this neighborhood is zoned for cornflakes,  but an intriguing notion nonetheless.”
“Okay, then sand. I could fill it with sand. Better yet, bullets. You can never have too many bullets. That’s my bullet room. I have a bullet room.”
“Well, as long as it’s something practical. Oh, I brought you coffee and a bagel.”
~
For example, the fact that I spilled twelve tea bags in my purse this morning took me immediately from mostly asleep to HULK SMASH.
~
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell us. I tell you guys everything. I tell you things I don’t tell my dermatologist.”
“You still haven’t gotten that looked at?”
~ “We can’t take him to the emergency room! What is the first thing they ask you when you show up?” “I don’t know!” Sam elbows him. “Unlike some people, I’ve never jumped out of a tree and broken my arm.”
~
“Stop being such a man about it and take some Midol.”
~ “Seriously, who decides to design a space ship you can’t see out of? What about a helpful message: Warning! You are about to rematerialise your passengers on the edge of a cliff or up to their necks in water or in any manner of other uncomfortable positions, not to mention fatal ones. It’s a ridiculous design flaw. Give me five minutes with a dart and I’d fix that.”
~
“Oh. Dungeons,” Rodney said miserably. “Why can’t it even be nice spacious apartments with dancing girls and grapes?”
~
“He is no threat to your land or your people.”
Unless we don’t get him back, in which case we will destroy you, Ronon’s posture said. And – would you look at that?– Rodney expression conveyed exactly the same, and it was there, too, underneath the woman’s carefully-constructed mask.
~ “Hey, why wasn’t J’onn changed with the rest of us?” “You are apparently missing a fundamental concept of the word ‘shapeshifter,’”
~
At some point, people were going to understand the whole “deflecting bullets with bracelets” thing, but apparently tonight was not that night. Roberts emptied his clip, then stood there slack jawed as Diana flew towards him.
~ She decked him. “I am rapidly losing faith in the penal system in this state.” 
~ He stood outside and listened for the sound of Ronon being bloodily torn to pieces, but there was nothing.
~
Since his oldest sisters had gone away to school in a distant town, they had taken to wearing drab and mannish clothes, and talked loudly and frequently about the iniquity of a patriarchal society. Cedric had no idea what that meant, but he did understand that it meant that he got hit whenever he said something about girls not being as good as boys.
~
The prisoners stumbled in last, each one with their wrists lashed to a rider’s saddle. “Do you have any idea what would have happened to me if I’d fallen over?” one of them was saying, his voice audible even over all the other people in the yard. “I would have been flayed to death, because that ground was not smooth, I’ll have you know. I think you should consider this next time you capture people and drag them to your lair for the hideous death thing.”
~ “Uh, just so you know?” Rodney raised his hand. “You should search Kit for valuables before he leaves, and if you find anything… He’s not with us. I’m just saying.”
~
“For the last time, I am not-- No. Dignity. See how I respond with dignity to your childish assertions.”
~
“I’ll speak with the dog,” she promised before turning away.
~
“This reality?” Dean set his beer back down. “You’re messing with me, aren’t you? You know I like those movies and now you’re messing with me. What is this? I know Jess doesn’t want me in the wedding, but you’re inviting us, right?”
~
“Some of us have knives to our throats.” Rodney’s voice was strained. “Talking… moves things, you know?”
~ If you’re seeing this, then I’m dead. If I’m not, I need to encrypt my personal files better.
~ “The Malevolent Association of Malicious Antagonists has been around for centuries and is a very well established criminal syndicate—”
“Destro, their acronym is MAMA! How tough could they be?” Cobra Commander snapped.
~
“WATCH OUT FOR THAT ACID!” Someone screamed. “AAAAAAH!”
“Ouch! That’s never a good thing to hear,” Zartan winced. BOOOOOOOOOOOM! “Or that,” Zartan winced again. FLOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! “Floom?” Zartan blinked. “What the hell goes ‘floom’?”
~
“Like I told you before, he remembers the facts, but, not the context for them,” Barbara finished. “Except for what was starting to come back.” She frowned. “So, semantic memory is there, and procedural—that’s why he still remembered the door codes—but his episodic memory is,” she bit her lip, “more affected.”
~ Dick had struggled to explain that he wasn’t this ‘Lunaire’ person, but whatever they’d shot him with had made his tongue swell up so badly that he hadn’t been able to do anything but drool.
~ “Hey!” Tim put on an injured air. “I do know a little something about computer hacking. I don’t have to depend on her for everything, you know.”
“She punched through their security while you were still trying to decipher the preliminary coding.”
~
He’d scared her off. Right, because there was nothing like being totally inept at the most basic social interactions to set off a girl’s internal alarms. God only knew what she thought of him now: raised without a woman’s touch, never dated much, grew up without friends… oh. Yeah, okay, so maybe she wasn’t too far off the mark.
~
“This happens to us with frightening regularity.”  “What?” Dean blinks at Sam for a moment before he lets out a frustrated huff and then flails his hand between them, making the universal sign for we’re naked and I’m a little flummoxed about it. 
“Well, I didn’t know if you were referring to the being cursed part or the being naked part of our current situation,” Sam says with a completely deadpan expression.
~ “Isn’t someone going to complain about this?” Sam asks, indicating himself and Dean and their state of undress with a complicated nod-shake of his head because he can’t currently free a hand.  “All my neighbours think I’m some kind of whacky artist. Anyone calls the cops, I’ll tell them you’re an installation.”
~ The Big Bossman? Should be VERY glad he is on vacation. He’d be a dead bossman if he were handy. (They’d never be able to convict. Bossman is not well liked. We’d all be “Seriously, officer, his head just spontaneously flew off and landed over there. It was amazing. Really!” *innocent faces*)
~ “I seriously will shoot you in the face,” he says, and he’s reasonably sure he means it.
~ “You went to buy beer, Dean,” Sam says, looking at the two horses standing behind his brother. The horses look at each other and then back at Sam, like they’re both saying, Yeah, we couldn’t believe it either.
~ I’d add “died of boredom” to my headstone but that wouldn’t make sense. I’m dying because I’m a dumbass. I’m only bored because I’m dying.
~ “Your spawn is evil and must die. Drown it before it turns on us all with destructive, murderous rage.”
“Be nice,” Harry admonished absently.
~ “Hell,” James said, fully equipped with a toddler’s unerring instinct for picking out the worst possible word in a sentence to repeat.
~ “You need to stop talking rude about me,” she says, pointing at his forehead, “even up there. Maybe I can’t hear it, but I know you’re thinking it.” He thought a particularly horrifying string of words forcefully at her and she frowned. “You’re doing it again.”
~ He thinks about dropping her into a star. Yay. She’d make ridiculous faces as she died. It cheers him up, a little.
~ He held her hostage with a butter knife, the first time; it was a tense moment, the Doctor alternately pleading and threatening, Rose kicking him in the shins and dumping a pot of cream over his head when she wiggled away. His defence at the time had been it was worth a shot.
~ I will kill you, he thinks experimentally. Kill you kill you kill you and dump cream on your head. I heard that, the Doctor thinks in response, snottily, from the console room. Don’t be an ass.  “I can tell you’re thinking to him, with your mouth all screwed up like that,” Rose says, dunking her last biscuit into her tea. He makes a face. “Tell him we’re out of crackers, while you’re at it.” I hate you and I wish you’d burned to a crisp with all the rest of our people and I hope I get the chance to set you on fire myself one day, soon, the Master thinks, pointedly. Also, we’re out of crackers.
~ “There’s probably something here we can feed him to,” Rose says, looking at the Doctor hopefully. “Not a thing.” “Pessimist,” Rose frowns, and stomps down the hill. After that, it’s laughably simple to guide them into life-threatening danger. He drops a suggestion to just one bright fellow in overalls; one thing leads to another and she’s accused of witchcraft and dragged away by a party of crazed, chanting townfolk. The Doctor’s attempts to free her get him carted off to jail; and the Master is left to shop leisurely and have a delightful lunch served by brunettes. Nice brunettes.
~ “I think I’ll keep her. I could shrink her. Put her in a snowglobe and shake it when she’s rude. Oh, I like that.”
~ “Kaylee--” he begins, his voice low and deadly serious.
“He didn’t touch me,” she says quickly. “I mean, ‘cept for tying me up.”
~ “Again,” Wash says, with a weary sigh, “married.” Jayne grunts. “Married ain’t dead, little man.” Zoe straightens, slides the panel closed. “Who said anything about little?” she remarks. Jayne sputters, and over his shoulder, Wash mouths I love you.
~
“I,” she says happily, “have discovered something !” “I can explain the burn in the carpet,” he says. “But the one on the wall wasn’t me. It sounds unlikely, I know, but there it is.” She looks as if she’s thinking of commenting, but then waves it away.
~
“Peter Petrelli!” Hiro’s chair topples over onto the floor when he jumps up, and just like that Peter goes from irritated to confused to encased by five-foot-six of excited Japanese man.
~ “You’re the perfect woman,” Harry added as she tugged away from her husband and moved around to the other side of the bar.
“You say that to everyone when you’re drunk, Harry,” Hannah said with a tolerant smile as she poured two more shots.
“And Nev,” Harry said mistily. “Nev, you’re the perfect woman, too.” Neville’s eyes welled up.
“You really think so, Harry? Really?” Harry nodded solemnly, and Neville sniffled. “You’re--you’re a damn fine one yourself,” the Herbology professor asserted proudly.
“Oh dear God,” Hannah sighed.
~
And we begin with an exhibition dance that has vaguely Native American cliche costumes (she’s in a bikini of feathers with a corn husk leg warmer; he’s got a weird chest medallion and head band) to Brazilian music. I...have no idea what to say. Egregious abuse of self-tanner on all parts. And Many women appear to have forgotten the left side of their costume. Most of the men are showing me their navels.
~ Pros: Finally, a film that understands the watchability of any of any musical is directly proportionate to the number of giant shark attacks it features.  Cons: It’s still a musical, and the female lead’s performance of “Cats Being Strangled in E Flat” goes on for way too long before she does her best chum impression. 
~
“You,” he heard Rodney call. “Whoever you are. Angry man in robes. You really don’t want to stand there.”
~ “I’ll give you a signal if you should call... who are you going to call?”
“Nine one one. Or Hotch. Or nine one one and then Hotch.”
“At least you’ve thought this though.”
~
Gutteriez: “Alas, the parrot stood mute.”
~ But, dude. Seriously. All musical geekery aside, Mama Mia! is Chicago level good. It is Moulin Rouge! level good. And neither my movie nor my muscial scale goes any higher than either Chicago or Moulin Rouge!.
~ The Doctor stays where he is, aware of Donna’s accusing eyes and Martha’s not-particularly-silent silence. He groans and scrubs a hand through his hair. “Well, how was I to know?” A few bloody wires and a zombie apocalypse sweeps the globe? It is actually new. He’s not had that one yet. Though, yes, a number of times he has come surprisingly close. Zombies are far easier to accidentally create than one would think. Not that he created this lot, of course, they already existed. He just, well, accidentally let them loose. Donna looks at Martha. Martha looks back. The Doctor groans. He knows that look. He hates that look. “I’ll make tea,” he says. Running away, he maintains, is a wise course of action.
~ He stops at the door, ducking back for a sandwich. Stopping an apocalypse is best done on a full stomach. One never knows when one will have a chance to eat. He puts on another pot of tea. Just in case, one can never have too much tea.
~ Dean took the check said thank you and managed to work Christo into the conversation six times before being satisfied that this was real.
~
The stranger ducks the hex again and pulls a short metal wand from his trench coat. “Teddy, what d’you suppose would happen if, hypothetically, someone hit a wand with a sonic device tuned to the exact right frequency?” Teddy blinks at him. “Um…” “Yeah, me either.” The stranger points the metal wand at the hag, its tip flaring blue, and a high-pitched buzzing tickles Teddy’s ears.
~ Dumbledore looked at the doctor and smiled. At the same time each pulled out a paper bag from his pocket and offered the other a candy. Both nearly collapsed in a giggling fit.
~
‘Gah!’ Tony exclaimed, as the stranger was suddenly and quite inexplicably far too close, staring down his nose at him. ‘Are you drunk?’ The stranger’s voice seemed to soar upwards by several octaves, and he peered at Tony like he was a particularly shocking insect.
~ Eventually McKay came up to him, with Stark furiously prodding at something in the background with a tool that was, no doubt, highly complex and exotic, but looked to John suspiciously like a glorified prodding stick, which was apparently causing the lights of the entire area flicker.
~ “Why are you shouting?” He asked her, enjoying the commentary all the same. “No real need to shout.” She waved the recorder a little, “It’s voice activated and it’s got this buggy on/off thing so if I talk normal it just shuts off.” “Why don’t you get a new one?” She looked offended, “This is my lucky tape recorder.” “How lucky?” She shrugged, “Well, I’m not dead.”
~ She huffed, still indignant at the memory. “Long story. Well, we had a mixer at work, he was somebody’s guest, he touched my boob and I shoved the brie up his nose.” She frowned, “. . . short story, I guess.”
~
“So, he plans on rectifying the present situation by glaring at us through binoculars from half a street and twelve stories?”
~ With one look at it, Perry had a visible moment of realization, “Papadakis?!” Lois confirmed, “Papadakis!”  “Papadakis!” John said, mainly because it seemed fun to say.
~
“So, you’re satisfied he’s not some random axe murder I picked up off the street.” “I’m inclined to believe you’ve done that before,” John said. She shrugged, “He wasn’t an axe murderer.” Perry was still huffed up, “Why use an axe when ice picks are so handy?”
~ “Do you think they’ll give us more if I mention the fire-breathing demon-bear?” “They might think you’re insane.” “And no one pays the mad. Good point. Best not to mention it, then.”
~ The gunfire was getting louder, closer. “Can you hear that?”
“That’ll be the war,” the Doctor answered nonchalantly, shoving his hands in his pockets.
~ “Yeah,” Wash said, grinning like a fool. “It was a shotgun wedding, she had the shotgun, not me. I don’t like shotguns.”
~ “Enormously helpful,” he snaps. “Was there any other plagiarised wisdom you wanted to impart?”
~ “I thought human weddings involved a lot of chocolate and rope?” “That was the Aztecs,” said the Doctor, crouching at her feet. 
~ She didn’t even mind -- much -- that the Doctor had left her alone while he ran off to gawk at a computer or something.  “Try not to get kidnapped,” he’d called as he disappeared into the crowd, “I’ll be back to rescue you later.” So far she’d gone two hours without being kidnapped, and the little pickpocket had gotten a clout around the ear when he went for her purse.
~ Bambera decided not to ask how he knew about that, but decency and a couple of mutual intelligence treaties probably required her to let the Americans know their cover was blown
~
“And Dorothy, please check the dimensional stabiliser, if it still exists, and let me know if we’re about to explode.”
~
“Well,” said the Doctor, “I guess this means we need to overthrow the government.” “I think you’ve had enough, mate,” said the passing barman.
~ “Does that happen a lot?” Martha asked when she’d caught her breath. “Finding out that your future self has become the sworn enemy of someone powerful, I mean.” “No,” said the Doctor. “Well, almost never. Not frequently...” “So that’s a yes, then.” “I’ve come to the inescapable conclusion that one of my future selves is just a little bit obnoxious. Actually, that occurred to me a couple of bodies ago. I’m starting to think I might be the obnoxious one.”
~ Batman looked at the underpants, looked at Jack, looked at the underpants again, and turned his head to look at Gordon. Gordon looked somewhat embarrassed and held up his hands in a what-can-you-say gesture.
~
“... You aren’t joking. God, you are so sappy,” Adam grumbled. “I’m going have to eat puppies just to cancel out your sappiness.”
~
“Ooooh!” Elle said excitedly, clapping her hands. “I know what we can do with him!” “You have a solution?” Mohinder asked, looking surprised. “Oh,” Elle said, “were we trying to think up solutions? I just thought it’d be funny to put him in embarrassing poses and take pictures.”
~ “Stop looking so horrified,” Mohinder snapped at him. “We have no way of knowing where or not the virus is spread through their bites. We have no way of knowing if there even is a virus.”
“I don’t know Mohinder,” Matt replied, detached. “All the zombie movies I’ve ever seen are pretty clear on this point.”
“Yes,” Mohinder sneered. “Because zombie movies are clearly such wonderful places to obtain information about whether or not to end your life.”
“Well the certainly got the ‘destroy the brain’ part down pat,” Matt retorted.
~ “Um,” he said, trying not to sound like a complete uncultured idiot, and likely failing miserably. “I’m not sure if you got the memo, but there’s a chance that I might turn into a zombie, so-”
“Mohinder’s concerned that you would kill yourself,” she interrupted without preamble. “In order to prevent you from becoming a danger to the rest of us.”
“Well, that was my first instinct,” Matt admitted. “But, I don’t know. Maybe Mohinder’s right, maybe it’s not in the bite. Of course, he dumped so much alcohol on it that whatever caused it is probably dead by now, so...”
“But would you?” she pressed.
“Yeah, of course,” Matt answered.
~
“Well, give me a heart attack, why don’t you?” Matt yelled, annoyed.
“Didn’t you hear me? My mother’s missing in the midst of a- of a zombie apocalypse!”

“Mohinder?” she began slowly. “What are the chances your mother has an ability?” The chances are, apparently, very good.
~ He raises an eyebrow, swallowing a meatball whole. “I’ve not giving you the sex talk. That’s what the internet’s there for.”
~ They do their best to pretend that they aren’t crying. (Matt’s allergies are acting up; Mohinder thinks maybe he got something in his eye).
~
“Good. Feel free to use that when you’re angry, but I’ve got to warn you to never, ever say that around a Tamil Nadu woman. At the very least, she will think that you’re a vulgar man and will never date you. At the worst, her brothers will beat you up.” “Jeez, Mo. What the hell did you just teach me to say?” “Fuck,” Mohinder replied. “But it’s about a hundred times more offensive in my language than it is in yours.” “Huh. Otha.,” Matt muttered under his breath. He put his beer down on the table, rubbed his forehead and then suddenly did a double-take. “Wait a second! You think that one a lot!” He pointed his finger at Mohinder accusingly.
~ “It’s redundant to say the ‘Dr.’ AND the ‘Ph.D,’ you know.”
~
“HEY!” Molly protested. “I wasn’t the one who started the fire, Detective If-We-Turn-Up-The-Heat-It-Will-Cook-Faster!”
~ John blinks, his mind going briefly fuzzy as the words settle there. He doesn’t quite understand them. “Oh, okay,” he says, just before milk spews out his nose. “You WHAT?”
~ “It’s not food,” she argues. “Mom’s cooking is the worst in the world and since this is worse than that, it cannot therefore be food.”
~ “Why’s everyone up so early?” Dean asked peevishly, shuffling toward the coffee maker. He scowled unhappily when he found the carafe empty, giving it an annoyed, befuddled shake as if he expected more of the brown liquid to appear.
~ “Dude,” Sam started, but it was too late. At the word “bath” the dog had bolted. “Damn it,” sighed Sam. Left petting empty space, Dean stared. “I’m pretty sure he knows that word,” Sam said dryly.
~ But the move brought Dean that much closer to the flames, kick in his fight or flight reflex. Morgan suddenly doubted Dean had ever used the flight option in his life as he took a knee to the gut and a fist to the head.
~
Oops,” she says, which is sort of a stupid thing to say when you’ve just damaged the fabric of time with a paradox so massive you may as well have just sat down and begun to unravel the multiverse thread by thread and saved yourself the fuss, but she’s not feeling particularly urbane at the moment.  
~ “Oh, crumbs,” the Doctor mutters under his breath, which, she decides, is a very silly thing to say in any situation, but particularly silly when one is being glared at by a perturbed elderly woman in a green cardigan decorated with large felt cats.
~
“…who, you might recall, is extraordinarily fond of me and often says so without any provocation whatsoever.”  Mickey laughed. “Oh, you mean like this morning at breakfast when she called you a jam-obsessed maniac with the table manners of a particularly twitchy marmoset?”
~ Owen sighs. “I wish I knew more zombies. Then there could be a support group or something.”
~ She opens her bag and throws him the red beret she took. It’s kind of disturbing the way Jack’s whole face lights up, a wicked grin stealing across his lips. A few feet away, Ianto stops handing morning coffee to Mickey and Gwen, and stares in consternation at the beret. “Oh dear God,” he says. Martha thinks that she could quite enjoy working full-time for Torchwood.
~ “Yeah, you’re going to have to take that out.” He made a few frantic gestures he hoped would convey the message, How the hell do I do that?!
~ Luke pointed to a lurid pop-up picture of a creature that appeared to have had a large piece chewed out of its brain.
~
“Jacob something.” Dean clenched his jaw. “A guy harasses you for years and years and you don’t even know his name?”
 ~
“You… you shot Jacob at the shop, but he keeps coming back. Shouldn’t he be dead? More dead? Whatever you call it.”
 ~
It was a relatively fresh grave, which made for easier going. Digging graves was never easy work, but compared to a fifty year old, time-hardened and compacted grave in the dead of winter, this was child’s play. Not that children should be digging up bodies. Not normal children anyway. He’d had to help his dad a couple of times when he was a kid, but that had been the exception rather than the rule. 
 ~
“I’m not the one who told a paranoid schizophrenic I was the devil.” Sam glared.
“That was not my fault,” Dean said defensively. “He was a nutball. He took it totally out of context!”
 ~
“You said alien monster. You insinuated huge teeth and claws and the like,” he accused.
“It’s got teeth and claws,” Jack insisted.
“The size of salt grains, maybe,” Owen replied. “Tosh, I thought the scanners said at least 8 feet?”
“Am I the only one who’s glad it’s small enough to fit in a milk pitcher and not in need of a whale tank?” Ianto inquired.
 ~
“Come on, then, Vaughn. Attack the turtle! Attack! Kill!”
Now properly domesticated, Vaughn only swam around the turtle, disinterested.
 ~
“If you ever invite Joanna Hickman to another one of these parties, you will be demoted, Alfred.” He said to his butler without a trace of humor in his voice and he smiled and nodded politely to a guest that waved at him.
“To what position, if I may be so bold to ask, sir?”
“Janitor.” Bruce said simply.
“I already am the janitor, sir.”
“That’s beside the point.”
~ “There is enough tape in there to feed a small island population for a year,” he said. “Provided I had a small island and they could eat tape. Do I have an island?”
“No,” she said.
“Are you sure? I seem like someone who should own an island,” he said. “I should buy one. Look into islands for sale. I could use a secret base. Maybe in a volcano.” He held up a hand as though she had objected. “I know, a bit impractical.”
“The air conditioning bill alone...” she said.
“But think of the money saved in the winter,” he interjected.
~ Tony looked up. “Hey, don’t eavesdrop.”
“You would like me to engage my privacy function?” the AI asked, sounding somewhat affronted.
Pepper often remembered the days when she didn’t know AIs could be affronted.
“No, that’s all right,” Tony said. “If Miss Potts tries to kill me, I want witnesses.”
~
“It seemed illogical,” Tony interrupted. “The book. I mean, all someone had to do at any point was say ‘listen, you know that thing that you think I said or did or wanted to say or do? Totally did not happen. P.S, I dig you, let’s get married and spend our 10,000 a year.’ By the way, how does that work? Does some guy from the bank just show up on New Year’s Day and say ‘here is your 10,000 pounds, sir, don’t spend it all in one place?’”
“I...don’t know,” Pepper said, thoughtfully. “I hadn’t really thought about it.” Tony made a disbelieving note in his throat at her lack of curiosity. “I didn’t consider it vital to enjoying the story, Tony. And some people, they have this quality called ‘shyness’. I know it’s a foreign concept. Some people don’t spill everything in their heads out in a Shakespearean monologue as soon as it occurs to them.”
Tony furrowed his brow, as though trying to wrap his head around the concept. “The sister was an idiot, too,” he said, after a moment.
~
Dean met his gaze warily. “What sort of a plan?” Sam looked sheepish, and Dean already knew he was going to regret this. His brother’s, “You’re not gonna like it,” pretty much confirmed it.
~ Oh god, he was going to antagonize the fanatic in defiance of every single hostage situation, in any movie ever.
~ He wasn’t supposed to have it, of course, but being the retired director of the SGC had its perks, including no one looking at his briefcase when he left. And obviously, this was entirely justified, since he’d now found himself in need of one.
~
“Ghosts.”
“That’s the one.” “Are real.”
“You got it.”
~ “Hey, look at you, all gaga over the idea of talking bunnies!” His face went earnest again. “I’ll introduce you, man. His name is Cinderfluff.” Sam frowned, suddenly suspicious. “You’re pulling my leg.” “No, man, I swear. Cinderfluff. He’s awesome.”
~ “FOR NARNIA!” roared the crowd around them, unaware of the conversation but perfectly happy to take part in some gratuitous cheering.
~ “Oh, we gotta make sure you’re dead.” When Dean stared at him, he added. “Sir.”
Finding no help, he turned to Stanson, who explained. “Each reality can only have one physical manifestation of each subconscious entity at a given time, otherwise entropic cascade failure occurs in attempt to rectify the situation; effectively removing the doppelganger from existence.”
Dean folded and sent a glare his way. “Pauuul...”
“Only one you per reality. More than one and the universe tries to get rid of you. Apparently it’s painful.”
~ “Well, if you already are a fugitive...” He trailed off, and they followed his gaze to a car parked on the street. Dean turned his incredulous look onto Jake, who merely shrugged. Their silent banter was interrupted by a gasp from Paul, who had doubled over and was clutching his stomach. People stopped to stare as he flickered in and out of existence.
~
“Easy there, sweetie. You’re not quite out of the woods yet.” “But these aren’t woods,” she frowned, slightly confused. “It’s a room.” “And you’re on a good amount of morphine,” the nurse chuckled.
~ “Robots,” Dean said, arching an eyebrow. Connor nodded. “Robots possessed by demons?” There was hope in Dean’s voice. Connor shook his head. “Robots created by man,” he said. “Then they take over.” “Do they work for the Devil?” Dean asked, looking askance at Sam. Now the kid’s eyebrows knotted and he leaned forward, looking Dean square in the eye. “They’re evil all on their own.” 
Sam kicked Dean under the table, meaning for Dean to leave the kid alone, but Dean just shook his head, as if coming out of deep thought. “I think it’s fucked up, Sammy. We’re spending all this time and energy fighting demons and trying to keep hellmouths shut, and the world ends up getting taken over by robots? What are we wasting our time for?”
~ In the morning, Dean found John Connor curled up on the floor of the closet, hair flopping over his eyes, Emily Dickinson’s book of poems clutched against his chest. He rolled his eyes and sighed dramatically. “This is the future savior of mankind?” He looked seriously over at Sam. “Well, I guess I know how it ends. The machines win.”
~ “I think he’s hurt.” Before Charlie could process that perhaps it was not a good idea to draw the attention of shouting, gun-wielding men to himself, the words were out.
~ In two pages of fic summaries, I have seen him go through multiple brain tumors, hypothermia, the exact plot from the season 5 finale of CSI, three sniper attacks, and a fall through a third story building into the basement where he then got hypothermia.
~
The guy met his gaze and then looked around behind him as though he expected there to be someone else. His hand rose to his chest like he was pointing at himself and said, “That’s not me.” “But ... not the weirdest thing so far,” Sheppard muttered.
~ “Find another seat. Ninety minutes late and no excuse? I start kicking your ass in 10, 9, 8 …”
“I was saving kittens. And orphans.” He pointed to his cheek. “See this cut? Line of fire.”
~
“Whoa, don’t do that, hurts m’head,” Shawn mumbled drowsily. After a moment of rubbing his temples, he looked up at Lassiter. “Oh, I think one of the guys hit me with a needle.” “You don’t say,” Lassiter said, biting the inside of his cheeks. “Do you know what it was?”
~ His heart was in the right place, but he took to fatherhood like a ostrich to surfing, and was at best, hopelessly awkward with the children in a way Anathema had learned to find endearing.
~
“Adam’s not a Muggle,” said Aziraphale. “He’s the Antichrist.” The woman blinked.
~
“Will your car fit all of us?” asked Anathema.  “It’s my car,” said Crowley darkly. “It will do what I tell it, if it knows what’s best for it.”
~
It occurred to Morgan it was a good thing Dean really wasn’t a serial killer because he would have been very, very proficient at it.
~
“I am not always blowing things up.”
“Right, sometimes you set things on fire.”
~ “He has a good poi—”Harry began to say, but then swallowed his words as Ginny sent him a warning look.
“I have a good what?” Arthur wanted to know.
“A good poinsetta,” Harry finished jovially. “Lovely flowers, I’ll send you a bouquet.”
~
“It’s like swimming!” Prince was shouting. “You throw them in at the deep end! Because if their feet can touch, they’ll never swim! Right?”
“I didn’t learn to swim like that!” said Albus, horrified at the idea and even more at the implication. “Did you learn to swim like that?”
Prince stopped on the stairs and spun to face him. “No,” he said. There was a tension in his face, as if his intellect was fighting a terrible war with his enthusiasm. It cleared up suddenly. “Eagles!” he shouted, and charged back up the steps. “Eagles!” Yorick repeated excitedly. Apparently he had caught on. “Eagles don’t get taken down to the ground and kicked back up,” Prince was shouting. “Their mum kicks them off a cliff or a tree branch, the higher the better! You see? Speed’s not the answer. We didn’t start high enough!” “You’re cracked,” said Albus. He looked over the edge to the ground below. Far below.
~
“No, you can’t ask your friends for help. What part of the ‘one’ in ‘chosen one’ don’t you understand?”
~
“Don’t take it personally. If you were named after You Know-Who, I’m sure you wouldn’t want to be seen sitting with a lot of Slytherins.” “I was named after two headmasters, and I’m not afraid of being seen with teachers,” Albus insisted.
~ The ghost held up a hand, and Albus fell silent. “I do not understand what you are talking about,” said the ghost. “And for that I am deeply, distinctly, profoundly grateful. Let me get something straight at once. I am neither a guidance counselor nor an agony aunt nor a divorce lawyer. You think I have a sympathetic face? Look again. I do not wish to hear your problems. Even if I had solutions to offer, I would withhold them in favor of watching your very entertaining and amusing social disasters. I have no interest in your family squabbles, and I am certainly not going to give you tips on how to be popular, impress your friends, or understand feminine logic for fun and profit. Do I make myself crystal clear?” “It’s clear you’re a right berk.”
~ “You type very loudly,” Angela enlightens him, straining for patience. “I would appreciate it if you attempted to check that habit in the future.” And then, because the look on his face hasn’t changed— “It’s very disruptive.”
“The way I type is disruptive,” Oscar says flatly, as though it’s ludicrous.
“Very,” Angela sniffs.
“It negatively affects your job performance,” he carries on, still with that terse, slightly incredulous note in his voice. Count on him to make this even more difficult than it needs to be.
“Yes,” Angela says firmly.
~ "Why didn't you tell us?" asked Hermione.
Hugo stared at her for a moment. Then he said, "Hi, Mum! Hi, Dad! I know I'm almost your age and you've never seen me before in your lives, but I'm your son, on a secret mission from the future. You won't conceive me for another ten years, but I thought I'd drop by and chat."
Hermione huffed. "Point taken."
~
“Eggnog!” Murphy exclaimed, from the kitchen. “California!” I called back. “Pineapple!” Kincaid chimed in.
~ “Ivey says Merry Christmas.” “Thanks,” I said. “To your cat,” he finished, with a smirk. I switched my view to Mister on the fireplace. He looked suitably smug. “I am too tired to be insulted.”
~ “We can ride around in the Batmobile!” Clark chirped.  Bruce sighed. “What happens if I refuse?”  “I will find a group of Christmas carolers and we will sing outside your, I must admit, very stately manor.”  “For how long?” Superman just smiled.
~
“These?” Cass asked, holding up the woolen gloves that covered her hands and, incidentally, completed the fashionable ensemble that Alfred and Superman had assembled for her while Bruce slowly went out of his mind.
~
Clark, why are you putting your orange peel in your pocket?" And wow, if there's some kind of Super reason ("there's a little girl in Bolivia who needs orange peels to live, Kon") or Kryptonian reason, ("All Kryptonians require the scent of orange peels to reach normal REM sleep, Kon. Why, don't you?") then he'll feel Super-Dumb.
~
"If he’s Zuperman, you must be the sidestick, Batman. Sidekick. Kick." In the backseat, Tim makes a sound like he's aspirated jello.
~ "Not a chance in hell," Tony says bluntly. He considers. "Well. Maybe one chance in hell."
"That's all I need," Martha answers. Her tone is matter-of-fact and her face calm and poised, without so much as the faintest flicker of doubt in her eyes. Tony looks at her and mentally upgrades the odds to two chances in hell.
~ I sniffed derisively. “It wasn’t a guess. When you opened the door, you never took your hand off the knob. You were putting weight on it, since your knuckles were turning white. So, you need support of some type. Obviously a cane, since you only braced yourself with one hand, and also, a cane would be the only thing that would fit behind the door, which was the only reasonable place that it would be. Therefore…” I let my voice trail off.
Babs grinned. “Oh, very good, Holmes.”
I shot a hurt look at Cass. “She impugned my deductive abilities.”
Cass didn’t look very apologetic. She pointed a finger at me. “You the one…” She adopted a shocked look and sputtered in mockery of me. “She’s standing?”
~
“Uh huh. Do you not remember the last time we investigated some mystical retreat? Getting chained in the basement, me nearly drowning – this ringing any bells with you?”
“Of course I remember but there’s no reason it would be the same. This sounds like a creature, not some human psycho looking to live forever.”
“I don’t care, we are not going to another retreat. End of story. I’m still trying to get over the whole incense and tofu thing.” said Dean, shuddering.
Sam gave him an incredulous look. “Right, ‘cause that’s the bit that bothers you most. Not that you nearly died, but that you accidentally ate tofu.”
~ She waved a hand and rolled her eyes again. “Don’t ask me why, I swear, every time I talk to that guy my vocabulary tries to grow by five percent.
~ “Of course not.” he said, as if genuinely puzzled that anyone should want to lock a door.
~ “You’re gonna walk around the place and go into a church armed?”
“No, Sam, I’m gonna walk around the creepy retreat looking for a murderous creature with just my sharp wit to attack it with.”
~ HA! Those cowboys boots Niki was wearing in the flashback are the best. It's like somebody in the costume department went, "Oh, shit, she's supposed to be trashy!" and managed to cram six months worth of accumulated trash into one cheap pair of footwear.
~ “All right, as annoying as the advertising bonanza that preceded her entrance was, Elle's growing on me. You know, like mold. Silly sociopathic mold. Which is possibly pink.”
~ “I've almost come to cherish and adore the fact that in any given situation Mohinder will somehow manage to have the best intentions possible and yet outrageously fail. And perhaps in the middle just trip over the rug and faceplant into the floor ... you know, as a tension breaker.”
~ “Oh, man, how much smarter does Mohinder look when Maya is in the same room? Then again, I think everybody's IQ skyrockets when she's around to compensate, like she's shooting spare brain cells out of her ears and people kind of have to pick them up like lint on a black coat.”
~
“I am now going to completely undermine my other intelligent points to say that Claire's coat is fifteen shades of pretty and I'd kill Sylar myself for it.”
~ I can't remember who was calling him the Restorationist, but YES. I call him that now if only because that sounds like a Bond villain and that might actually make the whole storyline interesting.
~ I don't want to like West, and that trick was really kind of very, VERY mean. And yet at the same time, I may never stop laughing. Quietly, and while holding gigantic invisible buckets of shame, but STILL.
~ Okay, I could seriously watch Nathan and Matt together all damn day. Let's just do an entire episode where Nathan and Matt chase down the people in the photo, and Matt spends a lot of time trying to be cop-intimidating and failing just a smidge, and Nathan makes up for that smidge by unloading shotguns and punching things and making snarky commentary about Matt and his hot Indian domestic partner.  Speaking of Mohinder, YOU IDIOT. Okay, make up your mind. The Company is bad. The Company is good. The Company shouldn't be allowed to touch Molly with a ten-foot pole. The Company can totally take care of Molly, and fix everything that Matt's dad broke, and Bob can dress up like a clown and make balloon animals for her. You're going to help Niki escape because the Company does awful things to heroes. You're going to go down to New Orleans and poke Monica with needles full of So Not The Legacy Virus because the Company is awesome and throws birthday parties for its employees and gives you free movie tickets and a cape if you work on Christm-- NO, SERIOUSLY, MOHINDER, IS YOUR BRAIN DRIBBLING OUT OF YOUR EARS?!
~ On some level I'm very much concerned by the fact that he is very skeevy and more than a little creepy, and on a more superficial level I'm blown away by the fact that he leaves his house dressed that badly in California and is allowed to live. Never have I seen a teenage boy who more silently screams that he's wearing tighty-whities, tube socks, and a V-neck undershirt under every outfit he wears, and all of them were bought by his mom.
~ Sirius pressed his lips together, desperately trying to recall the Muggle nomenclature. He remembered a recent Tube strike, and some choice words Remus had muttered over the morning papers. "Transport. The Ministry for Transport."  "You were in a battle for your life, in the Ministry for Transport?" The Doctor was nonplussed. "In nine hundred years, I have never yet been able to fathom British bureaucracy."
~
Sirius took the chance to slip out his wand and transfigure the twiggy garnish into a macaroon, then he popped it into his mouth with a satisfying crunch. "I saw that!" The Doctor pointed an accusatory finger at Sirius, then used it to dab up some crumbs from the table top. He touched his finger to the tip of his tongue, and his eyebrows shot into his hair. The waiter, startled, scurried away as fast as its pseudopodia could carry it. "Coconut! There isn't a coconut in this galaxy. You'd have to travel ninety-seven million light years just to reach the closest thing to a palm tree, and even then, they're a carnivorous race." He stood up, and pressed both his palms on the table menacingly. "Where did you get that macaroon, Sirius Black?"
~ "What would you wand-wielding types do?" The Doctor waved a hand. "Assuming that we're talking about advanced physics here, and acknowledging that there is, in fact, no such thing as magic. Hypothetically speaking."
~ Donna realized she was pouring into an ashtray, and redirected the flow into the last shot-glass."I'm sorry, couldn't they have found an acronym that was just a tiny bit more sinister?"
~ "Doctor," said Rose. "Why is there an astronaut in here?" "Is this some kind of riddle? Like, why did the Sontaran throw the clock out of the window? Because I'm a bit busy right now. In case you didn't notice, we came too bloody close to colliding with that space shuttle." He thwacked a control on the console. "I think her spatial calibrators need readjusting. Again."
"Obviously something needs readjusting. If you've got a 'make some bloke in a spacesuit appear out of nowhere' button on there, that's probably it." "Rose, what are you...?" The Doctor's annoyed response trailed off as he turned around. "Oh. It's a bloke in a spacesuit. That shouldn't have happened." He smiled, running a hand over his close-cropped hair. "Well, at least we materialized around him, instead of hitting him. Could have been messy, otherwise." The man in the spacesuit slowly took off his helmet and looked at them, wide-eyed. "Hello," he said. He swallowed. "Either my life support is failing and this is an extremely detailed anoxic hallucination, or else this is the single most profound moment of my entire life."
~ The door opened to admit the craggy, red-bearded face of Thomas Escher: former grade-school gym teacher, expert fisherman and reluctant statesman for the newly formed and post-apocalyptic settlement of Plymouth.
~ "But wouldn’t you rather find out how the constellation of Orion got inside Mrs Higgins' chest?" He held the flashlight up to his own face. "We can do no more for Mrs Higgins, my children. But rejoice, for we have a new patient, one that not even you can kill." All three of them looked at him expectantly, and he scowled into the beam of light, a gruesomely illuminated expression. "The MRI! The MRI is sick. Go, fix it."
~
“Wanna procreate?” His accompanying grin was wide and devoid of anything resembling innocence.
~
“But he rose from the dead. Other than Lazarus and Jesus Christ himself, and a few reports of zombies in Haiti...It doesn’t happen every day,” Reid cut to the chase. “And never has it been so well documented.”
~ “Spies,” Moody said again, a little forlornly. “Even just one spy. It’s been so long…”
~ And then something astonishing happened, something unforgettable. For once, the Order actually listened to him when he made an obviously intelligent suggestion, and then, miraculously, did not go ahead and do something stupid anyway. The foundations of Severus’ very world were rocked. Rocked, as if by a hurricane.
~ “So,” Lily said slowly, with a wide, toothy grin. “We’re in an alternate universe. This is, like…well, it’s totes rad.”
“Is that French?” Snape asked suspiciously. 
Victoire flinched violently, as if she’d been struck, and then unleashed upon the Potions Master a deadly glower with the force of a thousand furious French ancestors behind it. “‘Totes rad’ is, I assure you, very definitely not French,” Victoire said frostily, veritable icicles hanging from each word. Sharp icicles. Sharp icicles dripping blood.
“It’s German,” Teddy added helpfully.
“I hate everything,” Harry sighed.
“Excellent,” Snape replied dourly. “That makes two of us.”
~ He’d seen it happen before, someone catching sight of Harry or Mrs. Potter and completely losing their sanity over them. What with the saving-the-world-thing and the retired-Quidditch-star-thing, respectively, it wasn’t really all that uncommon a reaction. And Mrs. Potter, at least, knew how to deal with the obsessive adoration of the crazed masses. Harry just hexed people and swore a lot, but Mrs. Potter had her stalkers fetch her sandwiches and buy her expensive jewelry.
~
“…And then we were all on the floor and you were poking me with your wand.” Scorpius caught Al’s eye. As they were boys and thirteen years old, it was their job--nay, their sworn duty--to snicker. Harry flushed and rolled his eyes.
~ The shopkeeper sneered. Scorpius sneered. GreaseFace hadn’t stopped sneering for the last ten minutes, but now turned it up a few notches, getting into the spirit of things. James, evidently feeling left out, shrugged and sneered as well. It was a veritable sneerfest.
Harry simply shot them all a Look (Scorpius was impressed, it reached at least a 9.8 on the Granger-Percy Disapproval Scale) that wiped the sneers off all their faces. Even GreaseFace’s faltered briefly, before coming back better than ever.
~ “If all else fails, bribe them,” Scorpius offered helpfully, and Harry entertained briefly the possibility of offering Draco a three-for-one child exchange, one-time-only, come on, it’s a great deal with low, low interest and an offspring-back guarantee if your eardrums aren’t completely ruptured within a fortnight, plus we’ll throw in this free toaster oven and it really, really works.
~ He was mildly impressed by how quickly his darlings lost their venomous glares when they realized they were no longer alone. Sneers were replaced by long-suffering shiny-eyed stares meant to communicate how, in general, each of them was oppressed unfairly by the others, how they were martyrs foiled by their siblings in their altruistic quests for peace and justice, how oh, they tried to speak sense, but the others were just beyond reason and logic, and really, wouldn’t it be kinder in the end just to put the others out of their misery…For a moment, they all tried to out-innocent each other, but gave up after unblemished virtue in the face of impossible odds began to look distinctly like constipation.
~ “I’m calling up your Aunt Hermione,” he said, each word quiet and precise and dramatically over-enunciated. Harry took a rather shameful satisfaction in the way their faces drained of color and their eyes went wide and terrified. “I’m telling her precisely what your behavior has been like recently, and how you’ve driven your mother to spending a weekend helping Uncle George at the shop, for Merlin’s sake, to finish her article and get away from the noise and chaos here. And then I am leaving you with her in a small, dim, windowless and sound-proofed room while Scorpius and I meet Teddy and Victoire for ice cream—and no, I will not be bringing any home for you.” Unless, he added silently, he could find anchovy-flavored ice cream. Or, even better, anchovy-flavored sorbet.
“Downstairs, all of you. And if I hear one raised voice, one single shout, I’ll see to it that your Uncle Percy has a talk with you too. A long talk.” There. That had them looking appropriately horrified—because Hermione at least recognized (and rejoiced in) the effect her lectures had, and everyone knew it. Percy, though, Percy was earnest. Percy used words like ‘edification’ and ‘youngsters’ without irony, and meant them, really meant them.
~ The last three words had precisely the same intonations Harry had once heard from a vampire purring happily about “oh, fresh meat, all that tasty nutritious blood to be spilled, with its yummy nutritious platelets” before he and Ron quite surprised it by ensuring that all of its dubiously nummy blood was spilled, delicious nutritious platelets and all.
“You’re a bit scary,” he observed admiringly.
“Yes,” Hermione agreed with a self-satisfied Mona Lisa-type smile. “I know.”
~ “Ah, Gran wanted me to tell you to tell Aunt Andromeda,” he began, but Victoire began tapping their table slowly with very long, excessively manicured fingernails, and it sounded like the distant beat of the drums of war. Scorpius wisely fell silent. Harry resolved to buy Victoire something truly amazing for her next birthday. Like a pony. Girls liked ponies, right? Lily was always going on about flesh-eating thestral foals and how cute they were and how she wanted one, Dad, please, how come he never let her have anything she wanted, he was totally unchill, like, Sahara-desert-in-midday unchill.
~ “If I ever marry into your family,” Scorpius informed them, “And it would be hard not to, given that it makes up about half the Wizarding World these days… Well, I shall take my spouse far, far away, where the rest of your kind cannot hope follow. And if you do try to find us, I will not be merciful.”
“Fair enough,” Harry allowed.

“Lils. Today is a very special day, the start of your journey as a young witch, etcetera and so forth. The point is, you will be getting your first wand. And if I so much as suspect you of using it at any point during our trip, I will take it away and break it into tiny little peaces which I will then, and don’t think I won’t, feed to Pigwidgeon Hedwig the Second. Not a word about animal cruelty, Rose, not a word.”
~ Ginny made a suspiciously snort-like sound, but when he glanced over, she looked deeply absorbed in the paper. Spongefully absorbed. Staring at it like it was the most fascinating thing she’d ever seen, in fact, which was a sure sign that she was inwardly cracking the hell up.
~ "Sometimes, words can't describe it," Duncan pronounced. "You have to experience it firsthand."
"Well, personally I don't see why we couldn't have skipped this part and gone straight to the carousing and women. An up close and personal demonstration of how you used to catch your own breakfast before dawn isn’t exactly the stuff of legends."
~ “Guess weird stuff happens here a lot,” Sam answers. That’s the same kind of understatement as “succubae are ok-looking”.
~ She shrugged. "I don't know. I could listen in but it's all Greek to me. I quite cheerfully skipped all my science classes."
He let himself smile. "Not something I want to hear when you're supposed to be the one in charge of the wires stuck to my head."
"Oh, those. They gave me a list of button colours that I shouldn't touch."
~ Michael hummed a familiar tune. Amused, Sam watched Dean's face change from interested to horrified disbelief.
"You have got to be kidding me!" he snapped.
Michael shrugged, turning away. "You asked."
Dean ran both hands over his head before sighing heavily. "Great. This is just freaking perfect." He groaned again before shaking out his shoulders and setting his attention on the task at hand. In a singsong voice, Dean repeated an ancient exorcism ritual to the tune 'Twinkle, twinkle, little star.' Sam couldn't help the grin covering his face, but he made damn sure to cover it up when Dean turned around.
~
“Large? He has green skin! And horns! What did he give as his name?” Sybil looked at the register. “Olaf, king of the Trolls,” she said.
~ “Well, that’s a relief,” Basil said. He wiped his brow. “I doubt if Terry could have cooked babies. Pork and ale we can manage.”
~ "A hart is a deer," General Landry explained unexpectedly, shaking his head. "A gazelle is a member of the antelope family, and usually a lot smaller." At the surprised glances of the others around the table, he shrugged his shoulders expressively. "What? I hunt."
~ “No,” Dean said, at the same time Sam said “Yes.”
“Well, which is it?” “No,” Dean repeated, and Sam again said “Yes.”
~ "We generally do not use the honourific," he says. "Too many doctorals in one room makes it inconvenient."
~ “Yes,” Buffy agreed, “I would place this firmly in the 'of the bad' category.”  “No,” Xander quipped, “This is exactly where we wanted to end up. This is Africa, just less jungley than the last time we were here. And without the giraffes. Unless there are giraffes, and they're just very small.” He brought his forefinger and thumb about two centimeters apart to demonstrate just how small the giraffes would be.
~
"Dangerous?" He waves his hand dismissively. "No, no. Not at all."  Rose waits for it, counting the seconds, and when she reaches twelve, he glances at her and adds, "Well. Dangerous-ish. You could say that. Radiation, eyes, brain, long periods of exposure, yes, I'd say it's dangerous. Maybe."
~ Turning a corner, Peter came face to chest with a seven-foot-fucking-tall bear of a man. He heard a metallic noise and saw Colossus’ skin become a lot shinier. “I should’ve punched you before you did that, right?” Peter asked.
~ “Santa?” one, a little boy, asked. “Nailed it!” “Where’s your beard?” a small girl with braces asked. “I shaved it. Those things’re itchy.” “Why are you so skinny?” a glasses-wearing boy asked. “I’ve been on the Subway diet.” “Why are you here? It’s not Christmas for months.” Peter rubbed his chin. “Quality assurance! You see, we’ve been getting complaints about kids receiving things they haven’t asked for… underwear, socks, fruitcake. I’m here to confirm your order. You, sir!” He pointed to a child. “We have you down for socks! Big long socks! Is that what you wanted?”
“No, I wanted an X-Box!” “Good, then I’m glad we caught that little error in time! Anyone else want something for Christmas?”
~ “Felicia Hardy, a jewel thief. I was trying to capture her before the cataclysm; now she works for me.” “Works with him,” Felicia insisted to Mystique. “Any more of that backtalk and I’ll make you give that fancy diamond necklace back.”
“To which pile of ash?” Peter turned back to Mystique. “You’ll have to forgive Felicia, she was tragically born without a sense of tact.”
~ Eight hours in, Elektra turned to Frank. “You know, anyone else would have tried to fill last night with a bunch of meaningless small talk.” “I know.” “I appreciate that you didn’t.” “I appreciate that you didn’t either.”
“Let’s never partner up with anyone else.” “Okay.”
~ “Frank, you’re in charge for the day by virtue of having the twin qualifications of being the most qualified and the least crazy. Remember, no cruel and unusual punishments.” “Define cruel and unusual.” “Castration.”
“There goes my entire rape discouragement plan.”
~
“Oh yes, the portal!” Forge cried. “I guess everyone will want to hear about the portal now! No one ever asks about little ol’ me. No one’s even mentioned my new cybernetic leg!” Peter and Jean took a look at one of his legs, which proved to be metal.  “Wow,” Jean said. “Nice workmanship. What is that, your fourth?” “My third, actually. I added a gyroscope so I can…” “Yes, yes, we’re all very excited about your third leg,” Peter cut in. “Now can we bottom line this? I’ve got a civilization to rebuild.”
~ “Now, the distance is too great to traverse by foot, so we’ll be using the horses. Any questions?” Peter’s hand shot up. Jean gestured for him to go. “Yes. Why are we using a holographic map instead of a regular old Rand McNally map? I mean, how much did that little holo-projector run you, anyway?” Jean smiled despite herself. “Any intelligent questions?”
“Just sayin’, maybe you could’ve spent the money on getting better costumes. Because seriously, guys? I can’t believe you actually go outside in those things.”
~ “Actually, I haven’t given you much thought one way or the other,” Peter quipped. Or he would have quipped if Sabretooth’s baseball-glove-sized hand wasn’t covering his mouth. As it was, his droll witticism came out as a series of vowels.
~ “No more Mr. Ice Guy,” Bobby said as a white beam burst loose from his palm, coating Sabretooth with ice before the man-animal bounded away.  Peter jumped to his feet, freed from Sabretooth’s clutches. “What took you so long?” “Had to think up that Ice Guy line.” “What is going on and why is it so loud?” Jean asked as she pulled her sleeping mask off. “Sabretooth tried to kill me or have sex with me or both, but Bobby sent him packing.” “While making a wry quip,” Bobby clarified.
~ He had thought that the woman was carrying some sort of rifle, but upon closer examination it appeared to be a… “Are you threatening me with a bow and arrow? Honestly, it’s the 21st century. He has a gun, I can respect that. Who do you think you are? Hawkeye?”
~ “Name’s Hannibal King,” the man said, still exerting himself against the telekinetic grip. “The hellcat over there is Abigail Whistler. We’re fearless vampire hunters.”
“I’ve told you not to introduce us that way,” Abigail interjected. “You hunt… vampires?” Peter asked dubiously.  “Yeah. There’s a great deal of job satisfaction, but no dental plan.” “These people are crazy, Jean. It’s obvious the cataclysm drove them insane.”
“I’m not sure,” Jean said. “The X-Men fought Dracula once… he was trying to make Storm his bride. That happens a lot with us.” “You can’t have fought Dracula!” Hannibal protested. “We killed him!” “King…” Abigail said warningly. “Alright, we may have had a little help.” “Come to think of it,” Peter said, reminiscing. “I did fight this guy called Morbius once. He was kinda vampire-ish. I just assumed it was a goth thing.”
~ That happy feeling he got in the pit of his stomach when he was pretty sure he wasn’t going to die melted away the second Abigail got back and he saw she was out of arrows. Abby never ran out of arrows. Ever. “How many are there?” he asked. “How many does it take before you can call it a horde?” She replied.
~ “I’m fine.” “Albeit suddenly out a perfectly good mirror.”
~ Bobby woke slowly. His first instinct wasn't to check the manacles chained to his wrists and feet. It was to roll out of bed, grab a danish, take a shower... the chains came as quite a surprise and for a moment he wondered if he had taken someone particularly kinky home last night instead of… Oh. The room was some kind of cell, a police cell.
~ Peter was just congratulating himself on disarming the man when the gunman headbutted him, then fully kicked him away. Trained in close-combat. Why were they always trained in close-combat?
~
“Timothy. Augustus. Drake!” Tim hated hearing his middle name. And not just because it was Augustus. “Hey dad.” “On a school night!” Livid with rage, Jack Drake sometimes forgot good grammar. “I went to bed early.” “Baseball bat!”
“I’m fine, though.” “On my way there!”
“See you then.” “Go nowhere!” “Righto.”
He toggled. “You’ve got Drake.” “A !@%$!* baseball bat?” “Hey Slobo.”
“That’s fraggin’ hardcore!”  “I think so too.” “Chicks dig scars! Did you get a good scar?” 
There was a zoom and Bart was there, holding quite possibly the entire Library of Congress in his arms. “I brought reading material.” “I’ll have to call you back,” Tim told Slobo.
~ “What do you think I ought to do with the sword?” Luna looked at it. “You don’t want to keep it?” “I imagine I’d look right odd, carrying a sword around everywhere. Besides, I don’t think I’d have much use for it!” “Have you tried putting it back in the Sorting Hat?” “It doesn’t fit. And the Hat yelled at me.”
~ “Gotta run. Call you back.” Jack turned to the control board. “Where’s the button for get us the hell out of here?”
~ “I know we don’t kill, but would it be wrong to reposition an Army firing range over their parking lot?”
~ "I think you might have a concussion," Scott helped his brother into the passenger seat.  Alex leaned back against the headrest and winced. "If I have to hurl, can I throw up in your hat?"  Scott laughed, and put the key in the ignition. "Sure. As long as you wear it all the way home."
~ “Sam, they sneezed on us. And are excited to be on this planet. I have no interest in surviving a pack of hell hounds just to be killed by a pair of lunatics and their…” “Our dog. He was the runt of the litter and deformed at birth. A real mutt. But the wife and I, we’re suckers for the underdog,” Crichton explains. “Dog? What’s a dog? I demand to know what a dog is! A mutt better be a euphemism for emperor, Crichton,” Rygel shouts. Aeryn picks him up and slaps a hand over his mouth.
~
Rodney raised an eyebrow and stared at Fargo with his patented “don’t mess with me, I know one hundred sneaky and untraceable ways of turning your skin blue” look.
~
“Attractive little thing,” I thought, dazedly, before my sense of self-preservation roared into life. “Attractive little thing with a weapon. Shit.”
~ After a slightly hysterical exchange of, "Drop it!" "No, you drop it!", Angel had intervened by placing himself between the two women. Which had promptly gotten him shot, the moron.
~ “I got my period,” Becky murmurs at last.
Dean’s face is blank.  Very carefully blank.  “Oh.”
“So.  Um.  You wanna help me out here?”
Really, he’s the image of chill right now.  “Sure.  I’ll run to Walgreens.  You just… hang in there.” Her left eyebrow is eloquent.  Hang in there? it says.  Wow, thanks, Dad.
~
This is not a big deal.  Really, it’s not.  Dean has learned the female body very thoroughly, thanks, and he knows how uteruses work (especially since Becky’s birth—beautiful natural process, his fine ass).  It’s not like his wife has never sent him on a supply run before. But she always gives him a little Post-It with specific brand and product names, and usually a detailed description of what the box is supposed to look like.  Thank God for her OCD. Except not right now, since she’s being useless.
“You suck, Mia,” he tells her voicemail, and flips the phone closed. Hoo, boy.  Plan B.  He’s not thrilled about it, but at least on the third ring, he gets a businesslike: “Hello?”
“Sam, we’ve got a bit of a situation here.”
Sam just groans and says, “I leave you alone for a couple hours...”
“Do you remember what kind of pads Maria buys?  ‘Cause the drawer’s empty and—“
“Why the hell would I know that?” Sam says, deeply unimpressed by this conversation already.
“Well, I know how you two have little pajama parties with ice cream and old movies,” Dean bites back in appreciation for the attitude.  “Forgive me, I just assumed.”
“And why do you need to know?  This isn’t some creepy science project like that thing with the—“
“No, no,” Dean mutters quickly.  “Never again.”
“Then what?” Sam says, and now there’s honest curiosity in his voice.
“I’m picking some up at Walgreens.”
“Dean, Maria’s out of town,” Sam reminds him.
“Yeah, thank you, Anderson Cooper,” Dean snaps.  “They’re for Becky.”
There’s a long pause.  “Oh.”
“Yeah.”
“So…”
“Yeah.”
“Dude.”
“I know, man.” Dean is about to hang up in frustration, because wow, this whole exchange is going nowhere.  But right then, there’s a funny scratching noise on Sam’s end, followed by a mumble of voices.
“Hang on a second, Dean, I’m giving you to—“ mumble mumble scratch mumble.
“Hello?” a very puzzled voice says.
Dean sighs.  “Hi, Jo.”
Her voice warms considerably.  “Hey, how are you—“
Best get this over with.  “You’re a girl, right?”
Pause.  He can imagine the line drawn between her eyebrows.  “The hell kind of question is that?”
“Because I’m at the drug store, and—“
“Dean, what’s going on?”
Go for it, man.  Like ripping off a band-aid.  “Canyoujusttellmewhatpadstobuy?” Blank silence.  This might require some clarification. “Becca needs, um, feminine products.” This time the silence is not so blank. “Are you—?”  Yeah, she is.  “Jo, this is not funny.”
“Sorry, I’m sorry,” she lies gleefully.  “It’s just, where’s Maria?”
“Drunk off her ass in New Orleans with her sister,” Dean says.  “Not helpful.”
“Oh, you poor man.”  And she’s still laughing at him.
“That’s it, give me your mother,” he grumps.
~ "I don't belong here," Draco sneered. "So you're not the prefect of me. And I am only slightly below average height for an eleven year old!"
~ He sat at the window with his arms locked around his knees, trying to tell the world how very displeased he was through the medium of icy, disdainful silence.
~ "Nose in a book like a good little Ravenclaw?" Zabini inquired. "If I had a mother like yours," Draco remarked sweetly, "I wouldn't talk about where anyone put any of their body parts. Those in glass houses, you know..."
~
"He certainly did not see me! I was sneaking about. Sneakily."
~ Draco gave a cry of righteous outrage. "You sound like an enraged teakettle," Terry told him.
~ "I'm good to her, Terry. I offer her slaves. What more could a woman want?"
~ He was just evolving a cunning scheme which would mean he could catch Potter and Weasley in the act and have them disgraced and turned away like so many house elves who deserved clothes, when Hermione sent him an Owl telling him when and where they were planning to commit their heinous crime, and added that she trusted him. He was on his way to tell a teacher when Terry wrested the Owl from him and read it. "Draco! You don't want to get Hermione expelled, do you?" Draco took a deep breath. "No, no. Of course not, you're right, I'm weak, it's just that I want my revenge against Potter—I must be kept away from the outside world," Draco informed him. "Invoke the power of your amulet to bar the doors!" "It's an inhaler, Draco, for the last time." Draco didn't know why Anthony insisted on using fancy words for his demon of the air, but he had more important things on his mind. He clung to the arms of the chair and stared at the arms on their clock. Sweat was dripping down his face; he could taste Potter's expulsion.
~ The next day, everyone had cast 'Reparo' on Terry's glasses and they were still hopelessly crooked, and Draco's nose was still tender but not actually bleeding anymore. Hermione told him she was very, very proud, and Draco told her that the thought of seeing Potter for the next six years had drained away his will to live.
~
He had a plan to learn lots of really cool Dark Magic, challenge Potter to a duel and beat him so comprehensively that he moved to Bermuda in shame. He also had a plan to get Hermione transferred to Ravenclaw where she would not be lured away from the paths of virtue. These plans all had to be put on hold when he realised that the end of year exams were mere months away and Hermione looked likely to beat him in every subject. Draco could not imagine what his father would say if his son the Ravenclaw came in second-best.
~
Draco switched all of Michael Corner's book covers and it took Corner thirty minutes to realise and then thirty more minutes to tell Draco exactly what he thought of someone low enough to sabotage someone else's study. Draco nodded, triumphantly counted off the minutes as Corner talked, and congratulated himself on the entire hour of study Corner would never get back.
~
"I'm afraid someone's strained their eyes reading in the dark!" Draco looked around with the hopeless hope that the healer was speaking about someone else, and met his mother's raised eyebrows. "That happens?" he yelped. "Nobody ever told me that could happen!" "Well, Draco, to be fair, we never thought it was going to be an issue," Mother remarked dryly. She glanced at the healer and added graciously, "Surprise Sorting into Ravenclaw" as if she was giving an actual reason for Draco's horrible sickness, like: "Mice bit him in the eyes." The healer nodded. "Happens all the time." Then because she was talking to Draco, she switched back to her air of manic happiness and disconnection from reality. "Someone's going to need glasses!" Draco's mouth opened and closed soundlessly as he realised this devil woman was seriously proposing to disfigure his face with an unholy contraption.  He stared up into her merciless smile and croaked: "Can't I get a seeing eye dog?" "A seeing eye dog that reads for you?" Mother asked, sounding heartlessly amused. Draco curled up sulkily in his chair. "It could be a magic dog. Can't Father buy me a magic dog?"
~	
"No, I... why are you wearing glasses, Malfoy?"
"Why are you wearing what appears to the contents of the inside of a chimney? Do you roll in your own filth?"
~
Draco was going for his wand when Father strolled over to them, and interrupting Draco's plan of attack was a cruel deed that Draco was sure qualified as parent/child abuse. "What is that?" asked Father, lip curling.  "I can't tell you," Draco said. "You told me never to talk about him in your presence ever again."
~
When he looked back Potter was glowering. "You got those glasses just to mock me, didn't you." "You are so self-centred it makes my brain hurt," Draco told him. He felt almost fond of his disfiguring ocular device for a change.
~
"Letting him off his leash was a bad idea," Draco sniffed. "See how he rolls in nasty things when you're not there to tell him firmly to sit and play human?" She turned to him, glowing, and he stepped back sharply, aware of his father's eyes. "Not when you have Potter all over you, please."  "It was nice of you to bring Harry back," she said, looking mistily proud. "He didn't," Potter yelped over Draco's assertions that he had planned to drop Potter into the Thames.
~
“Our house doesn’t have any stupid Heirs in it. If we did," Anthony said, "they'd probably just wander about the place being really good-looking." Draco lowered his book interrogatively. "Oh, yeah," Anthony went on. "I've been looking at pictures of Rowena Ravenclaw, she was really fit. We're the house of attractiveness." "How on earth did you get in?"
~ "They're my friends," Hermione said from under her bedclothes, "and I love them." Draco made a truly terrible face that unfortunately she could not appreciate, and said, "I think you have Stockholm Syndrome."
~ From dawn to dusk of Valentine's Day, Potter was hounded by singing dwarves, singing pixies, and singing First Years Draco had ordered to fill in the gaps. Through a method of careful observation, Draco noted how Potter's face changed from bemusement to embarrassment to despair to weary annoyance, and cackled to himself as he went to and from class.
~ Draco wondered exactly how insensitive it would be to tell Hermione that emotional displays made him feel all panicky and dizzy. Hermione laughed, a sharp bark of a laugh, and began to ruffle through their notes. "I waited for them to get annoyed with me, and for you to - I know the way you were brought up. I know you're supposed to hate the Muggleborn." "Well, I do," Draco said automatically, and then was amazed and relieved when Hermione laughed a bit more normally. "I mean... I was just using you for your notes," he said, and it was all true but there were other things that were true as well, and Hermione laughed again and leaned against him and sniffled as if she'd heard them, too. Draco patted her on the back and said: "You're weeping onto our schoolwork, woman. If you were in Ravenclaw you would learn more respect for your studies than this." He gave her a very severe look over his glasses and she choked laughing. Madam Pince gave them that Mr. Malfoy You Are My Least Favourite Ravenclaw Ever look, but Draco accepted her undying librarianly hatred in a good cause.
~ "I am really hurt," Draco said piteously into his pillow. "I fear I may die." "Yes, yes, quite," said Terry, who never understood the gravity of Draco's many awful plights, nor appreciated the constant threats Hogwarts posed to his safety and wellbeing.  "Maybe it was because of your dad, but - he had no right. Maybe Professor McGonagall will talk to him..." 
"No m'gonngull..." Draco mumbled sleepily. "Leave it to me. 'm goin' to plan a hor'ble revenge. Hor'ble revenge!"  "Is that so?" Terry asked. "Muahahahahaha...mm," said Draco decisively, and drifted into sleep with happy, cosy thoughts of mayhem. Later, he was forced to tell Terry and Hermione that he would lock them in a dark, deep dungeon if they ever disclosed what he was like drugged to the community at large.
~ He gave Potter the Glasses Look, and Potter appeared unimpressed, so Draco gave it up and tried to focus his mind on Arithmancy. His mind was a clear, blank slate. His mind was a cool, serene ocean. Potter began to tap against his teeth with the nib of his quill. If Draco sharpened his ruler he could stab Potter with it repeatedly before anyone had a chance to summon medical assistance. He heard Azkaban was lovely and peaceful this time of year.
~ When Draco got back to the dormitories, Terry took one look at him and said: "Anthony, go down to the kitchens and get the house elves to raid Professor Trelawney's secret stash now. Draco, what happened?" "Trelawney has a secret stash and nobody told me?" Draco said wanly. "I can trust no-one. This world is an empty bitter place. I saw Cho kissing Potter and I would like to first go blind and then lose my memory and then die, thank you." "Get the Firewhisky," said Terry.
~ Draco could not understand why they thought they were in danger of lustful assaults when Hogwarts, no matter what its other failings, provided its students with ready access to several mirrors.
~ The next day Draco had to face Crabbe and Goyle, and in the midst of a horrifically convoluted sentence about the less lying lies that lying Hufflepuffs lied about, Crabbe put a kindly hand on Draco's shoulder and said: "It's okay. Hermione already told us." Draco almost collapsed with relief. "She gave us a pamphlet and told us to study it carefully," Goyle said, beaming proudly. "And we are here to tell you-" he fished around in his pocket and produced a crumpled pamphlet, and began to read out loud laboriously - "that we fully support you in what must doubtless be a trying time for you. We only want your happiness and of course an assurance that you and your life partner are engaging in safe-"  "Stop! Stop and never speak again!" Draco commanded.  "Okay," Goyle said amiably. "I like Boot, though. Good choice."
~ "Certainly not," Draco replied with hauteur. "Ravenclaws never get drunk. Ravenclaws become inebriated."
~ "In what way," Draco asked furiously, "do you want to make my life unbearable today?" "So you haven't cooled off, then," said Potter, at his most redundant.
~ He wondered whether 'Your Darkness, Sir' would be appropriate, and then wished his mind would not scatter into a dozen panicked fleeing pieces when he was scared.
~ "I'm afraid I do not quite understand you," said Narcissa's mouth, and her eyes said "you terrible, incomprehensible woman."
~ “That’s always the first thing I want to hear, especially from the expert on the topic of pregnancy. That I look like a cow.”
“Nah, cows are sweet-tempered,” Lucy replied, ignoring the implied insult and hugging her.
~
“Hey. Hey, man, you with me?”
“No. ‘M in Bermuda…wi’ Kirsten.” An arm crept across his middle, unresisting when Sam gently moved it back. Hazy eyes blinked at him. “Y’r not…Kirsten, S’mmy.”
He grinned, just a little. “Yeah, and you have no idea how glad I am you can tell the difference.”
~ "How did you get here?"
"Let me repeat: That's what I want to know."
~ “You’re too young to be Dean,” he finally muttered. “And you’re missing the scar he has at his hairline.” Alec sighed. “Stay with me – I. Am. Not. Your. Son. Don’t know where he is or what he’s doing. Does he have a phone you can call or something, just to get this paranoia out of your system?”
~ "I don't guess," said Suzie. "I deduce and estimate and occasionally extrapolate."
~ He looked up only when a voice said, "Young man, is this in fact Egypt?" Daniel had looked up then to see an English gentleman addressing him from the doorway of a blue phone booth, he stuttered his reply, "Yes, of course." "But not, I take it, as your general appearance and language would indicate, the reign of Pharaoh Nebkheperure Tutankhamun in the eighteenth dynasty of Egypt?" "No, afraid that was over three thousand years ago." "Drat, I overshot it again." The man reentered the blue box which then disappeared while making that strange grinding sound.
~ “I simply resent being relegated to a figment of your imagination every time your teeny brain doesn’t like what I’m telling you.”
~ "So what's up with Lizzie?" Crichton pushed his sunglasses down and peered over them at Sheppard. "I think it's that you keep calling her Lizzie," said Sheppard. They were stretched out in a pair of lawn chairs on one of Atlantis' balconies, and the sun was shining brightly. "She's really sensitive about that." "Huh." Crichton stared out at the waves for a long moment. "I suppose if I were a glamorous intergalactic diplomat, I'd hate for someone to call me Lizzie too." "You don't really look like a Lizzie to me," drawled Sheppard. "You have any plans for the day beyond sunbathing your lily-white ass?"
~ You're retired," said M, "and should the worst come to the worst, we've never heard of you. You were a naval officer then a minor cog in the Ministry of Defence procurements department until you retired, then invented a fantasy life as a secret agent and started to write about it. It's simple, and reasonably hard to disprove." "If I need any help..?" "Then I'm afraid you're on your own. But you might find this file interesting." She passed him another folder. "I can't let it leave the building, of course." "'Contraband Weapons Sources in the United States: Los Angeles Area.' Would there be any objection to taking a few notes?" "Of course not." "I think I'd better call my travel agent," said Bond. "You did," said M. "Three hours ago. The tickets should arrive by courier soon after you get home."
~ "What do the history books say?" "I haven't looked." Dean blinked. "If you looked, you'd know what happens." "Oh yes," the Doctor said cheerfully. "Which is why I haven't looked." Dean rolled his eyes. "I hate time travellers."
~
"How long has this statue of Horatio the Hideous been there?" "Three hundred years," said Snape. "It was a donation from the artist." "Oh, good. I wouldn't want to think anyone had paid for it.
~ “Besides, Aunt Ginny wasn’t exactly upset about the incident,” Teddy said, grinning. “If I’m remembering right, she went out and bought a cake. A giant chocolate cake. With ‘Good Work, Son’ spelled out in sprinkles on top.”
“That thing was amazing,” James reminisced with a happy sigh. “Not as good as your cakes, Dad, but there was something special about it anyway. I think because it tasted of Mister Malfoy’s pain. His sugary, delicious pain.”
~ “I hate this city!” Dean grumbled for the hundredth time in less than half an hour. “Who in hell designed this, Satan?! What moron makes a city with 50,000 people have only one road that leads in or out?”
“It’s Massachusetts. The whole north shore is designed like this,” Sam helpfully pointed out.
Dean glared at his brother who only smiled, pointing towards the bumper of the next car. “Traffic is moving.”
“Inches does not count as ‘moving’, Sammy. That’s called ‘crawling’, or ‘parking without leaving the e-brake on’.”
~
“Open-mindedness is sexy,” Victoire pronounced as Teddy’s bumbling, confused explanations finally ground to a halt. Teddy brightened tentatively. “And, it means you had the sense to recognize that I’m not only better than all the other girls you know, but every single person you know.”
“Uh. Yeah,” Teddy said, sounding confused and hesitantly relieved. “That’s it exactly.”
“And everyone you ever will know,” she added, her eyes narrowing suddenly to slits, her head tilted to an angle that should have been coy but instead chilled the blood and froze the marrow. “Am I correct?”
~ “Have I ever told you how much I admire your facility of expression and the erudition of your thoughts?” Scorpius asked innocently.
~ “Your father is paying for my therapy,” Harry told Scorpius. He wondered if commanding an Obliviator to erase the last five minutes of his life would constitute an abuse of his position and political power, and then he wondered if he really cared. “Just so you know.”
~
“Don’t you look at me in that tone of voice.”

“These men did not die of natural causes. Awesome…well, not for them.”
~
“Magic.” Alec ran through his mental index of street drugs and came up short. “What's that? Some kinda Benzo?”
~ “Yeah, yeah, sorry,” Dean got back to eating. “The following is the sound of me shutting up.” It also appeared that these guys were out of their fucking minds. “So... you lived here long, Alec?” Dean's vow of silence hadn't lasted too long. 
“For 297 days,” Alec wasn't sure why he told him. It might have been for the simple reason that no one had ever asked him before. “And 10 hours.” “Wow,” Dean nodded appreciatively. “That's extremely... exact.”
~ “I’ve got steel toed boots on,” Dean gladly informed him.
~ “Recite your ABCs. Maybe gimme a date and a year?” Alec felt his mouth move but no words came out. “How about a location?” Dean suggested. “Hell, I'll settle for the word 'floor' right now.”
~ “I thought it might be kinda weird ya know. Callin' you dad," Alec moved back into the living room. “I mean yer not that old or anything. Hell, you must have been a kid yourself when I came along-- yeah wait, was I planned? You know a mistake of passion? A happy accident?” Sam's face flushed red as he tried to look interested in the uneven planks of the floor. “I knew it!" Alec brightened despite himself. “I always wanted to be a mistake.” Sam looked at him sideways. “Being a fancy blueprint for death and destruction doesn't have all the perks one would imagine,” Alec mumbled. “Being born for no good reason is the best news I've heard in my whole life.”
~ “How long do ya think it will take them to figure out we're not coming? I like to panic on a schedule.”  “They'll be here in about fifteen,” Sam answered.  “Minutes or seconds?”
~ Alec stopped him with a raised hand. “I know what you’re gonna say,” he assured him. “Your death won’t stop a thing? Why waste a perfectly good mystical bullet? The gate will be opened regardless of your brain splatter and so on and so forth…?” White’s gaze narrowed. “But I’m okay with all that,” Alec told him. “See ya on the other side, Ames.”
~ “Thanks again for doing that. Our equipment was getting a little uh… what are the kids calling it these days?” “Out-dated and useless?”
“The kids sure are judgmental and harsh.”
~ “He has a phone,” he assured him. “And about a billion dollars worth of genetic enhancement in the off chance that he may need to defend himself. Honestly? I think it was a little cold of him to leave our sorry asses alone out here. If anyone is going to get hurt it’s probably going to be me. By the way he’s 21, dude. What do you want to do? Give him a curfew and an allowance?” “That sounds reasonable,” Sam nodded. “What like, midnight or something?” “Christ.” ~
A woman suddenly appeared in a flowered housecoat and holding a wrench. 
“Hi there,” Dean politely greeted her. “Do you happen to have any rooms available—“ “Only got one room and its twenty bucks cash,” she pointed at a tiny key attached to a rusted hubcap hanging on the wall. “Water is only on from 3am to 3:30. No fights. No parties. No pets.” “Sounds perfect,” Dean snagged the over sized key chain. “Can we get some extra towels?” “No towels.” “Right.”
~ “Look, all I’m saying is tone it down a little. Instead of ‘the drug dealer’, say ‘this guy I met’. And when you want to say ‘rob’, try saying ‘ran into’...”
~ “Does someone want to let me in on the whole basement thing?” Alec ventured. “’Cause I can pick those locks no problem.” Dean cleared his throat and sat back in his chair. When his uncle couldn’t seem to find the right words Alec thought he’d help him out by cutting to the chase.  “Are you keeping a dead guy down there?” “Dead is a strong word...” Alec felt his appetite waver.
~ “Don’t go looking at me like that,” Dean said. “Like what?” Alec readjusted his glare.  “Like you’re trying to make my head explode.” “But this isn’t fair.” “I’m glad you understand,” Dean said. “Another life lesson we can cross off the list.”
~ It was a perfect day for a raccoon hunt. Or violent death by tornado. Dean took a few steps backwards when the roof on the old tool shed floated onto its side for a second before crashing back down into place. Their house on the only hill in town gave a nice view of the thunderstorm hanging low across the shallow valley. Along with some light to moderately sized hail, the streaks of lightening were accompanied with a steady rain that soaked nice and slow through Dean’s jacket. “W-Why can’t we just shoot the raccoons?” Alec panted. “Why aren’t we doing that?” “I don’t know,” Dean replied miserably. “This way is just… better?” “Better for who?” Alec demanded. “The raccoons? That’s all this is better for. They rob the Twinkies of the damn traps and then they move back in. They’re mocking us!”
~
Shoving a stack of books off the bed, Dean wedged himself between the other piles and tried to get comfortable. “We got a perfectly good floor,” he said into the pillow. “And it’s great for storage.”
~ “Nothin’ is gonna happen to you,” Alec explained. “Because for something to happen to you means something has to kick my ass first and my ass is hard to kick. Is everyone listening?”
~ Conversation flowed a bit more freely without a five year old female civilian in the immediate vicinity. Or at least a lot of expletives they’d been storing away to maintain decency seemed to all be coming out all at once.
~ “Dude, it’s a park reserve filled with cute animals,” Dean said. “Killing every living thing for convenience doesn’t go over real well with basic karma.”
~ “Jesus Christ… you guys are the Winchesters.” “Could you say that again and a little louder?” Dean grinned. “My brother never believes me when I tell him we’re famous.”
~ Sam glanced down at his sticker name tag that read: Dean. His brother was wearing the one that read: Sam because his brother was just the kind of guy that found things like that hilarious.
~ Dean lost Sam exactly six times. He figured at least five of those times were because Sam hid, probably to pay him back for the first time. It wasn't exactly like he'd turned the garbage disposal on or anything and he totally denies knocking Sam into the sink in the first place. Sam returned to normal size with no warning. "Geroffme," Dean squeaked, head mashed into the mattress by one of Sam's elbows.
~ Mary made a small noise that John had come to recognise as her, ‘we’ll just see about that’ huff. Yeah, he was screwed.
~
I loved sucking-out-a-demon-with-nothing-but-my-manpaw!Sam. I wish to see more and possibly subscribe to a newsletter.
~ “I would call her a Mary Sue, but she lacks even the redeeming quality of being sunny and nice to everyone. She's merely egotism made flesh.”
~ “Serves you right if an undetected veterbral fracture paralyzes you, you enormous prat.”
~ Sam leaned over and attempted a whisper. "I am missing an internal organ right now. It's gone. They took it out of me." Yep, Sammy on drugs never failed to entertain. "Yeah. I remember." "It's an external organ now, Dean."
~ “Smarter than you,” Dean said, which was patently untrue, unless they were talking about werewolves.
~ “I love math,” he lied feebly.
~ “Dean,” Sam said quietly. Trying really hard not to reveal that he’d had similar suspicions, too. “If there’s a higher power or something responsible for this, man, it’ll hear you if you just say it in a normal tone of voice.”
~ “And so help me God, if you laugh, if you snicker, if you even BLINK wrong right now, I will eat the eyeballs right out of your skull.”
~
“This look like a dent to you?” Dean asked, running a hand over the spot as Morgan meandered past him.
“Nope,” Morgan said without even looking. “And for the record, I’m going to use all the hot water.”
~ The Winchesters didn’t say anything more. They just gave me steady looks and then settled into chairs at the foot of the bed. Machetes materialized in their laps.
~ “That would be me,” Gideon volunteered, using the smile he saved for traumatized victims and crazed lunatics alike.
~
She accidentally shrunk his sweatshirt the one time they mixed their laundry, and kept it to show her victory over unequal work and the patriarchy.
~ "Begging your pardon, Master Wayne, but when sensible people lose a fourth of their blood, they usually let their doctors give them more."
He scowls. "I didn't lose a fourth of my blood."
"Then the substance decorating your suit – that would be dried paint?"
~
"They injected him with kryptonite, I assume to keep him under control."
Superman looks at him over Jason's head. His face hardens. "They did." It's not quite a statement, not quite a question. It promises that a lot of people are going to be sorry.
~
"I heard Batman’s a robot," Bruce says, just for the hell of it. He takes a sip of his drink and grins at the discussion that starts.
~
"That would be me," Gideon volunteered, using the smile he saved for traumatised victims and crazed lunatics alike. 
~
"Man like that was born for this work. They should make him a saint." "I think you have to be dead first for that, Rod," Twins says, and Sam and Dean exchange looks. "He is dead," Dean finally says. "Died six months ago. Heart failure." Twins and Bob's Fish House give Dean a funny look, then look at each other the same way Sam and Dean look at each other. "That's impossible," they say at once. "He saved us last week," Twins says. "Smoked that demon like it was nothing," Bob's Fish House says, frowning. There's a moment of silence, and then Sam says, "Yeah, we're working on that."
~ “We barter,” Worcester explains. “You help me with my problem, I give you this.” Dean stared at the bright purple umbrella. “We risked our lives for an umbrella? You ever been attacked by a cholla cactus? Those needles break off if you just breathe on them! I’m not going to be able to walk right for a month.” “It’s valuable. Coveted,” Worcester insists, and Dean wonders if the man’s a swindler or just an idiot. Sam squints up at the clear blue sky and kicks up some dust. “You get a lot of rain around here?” he asks. “You daft, boy? Course not. But that makes umbrellas in these parts rare and rare means valuable.” “Can’t argue with the man’s logic, Sammy,” Dean says, and takes the umbrella. He flips it over and offers the handle to Sam. “Happy early birthday. A rare and valuable umbrella,” he says.
~ Sam starts gambling, and beats the house every time. He makes five grand in an hour. Dean has pretty much ignored Sam’s growing psychic powers, but he’s glad the kid finally has them under control. Sam says he doesn’t know what Dean’s talking about, but Dean saw that dice roll, and dice don’t move that way.
~
"Because we don't have a permit."
"A permit for a cake?"
"Yes. See the no persons beyond 21 past this point sign. That means no alcohol." "But we're not drinking?" "OH! Cake... I thought you said Keg! Sure cake is no problem!"
~ Even Bobby's shaking his head again, and Sam says, "I bet that sounded way more believable in your head."
~ “Yeah, I've got a plan. It involves guns.”
~
"You talk. You breathe. You exist. That's why I know you're up to mischief. Fire's hot, water's wet, and you turn people's lives ass over teakettle. That's how it is." The trickster lifted an eyebrow. The mints puffed out one cheek as he worked them against his gums. "You know, there so many possible jokes I could make right now about pots and kettles that I just can't decide."
~ "I swear to you, Sam, those sparkles were pink. What kind of demon gives off pink sparkles." Pause. "It would explain a lot about 'Hello Kitty,' though."
~ Crowley has met kings before, and emperors; men who quite literally held the power of life and death in their frequently unwashed hands.  Lex Luthor is significantly cleaner and far more impressive than almost all of them.  Caesar Augustus might have been able to hold his own against the man; Herod Basileus would have recognized a kindred spirit.  Alexander would have found his namesake incomprehensible.  All three would have been wise enough to try and have him killed, though Crowley finds it highly doubtful that they would have succeeded. 
~ Rather, Lex finds himself enjoying Crowley's increasingly cynical asides, his amused - and amusing - assessments of anyone unfortunate enough to come into view, and his shamelessly unapologetic lack of anything remotely resembling morals. 
~ "You were dead," Logan says flatly.  "Full marks for observation," Lyman murmurs.
~ "This is a bad idea," Spike says. The words are enough to make Alex pause.  Spike, after all, is the king, queen, and crown prince of bad ideas and half-cocked plans, and if he thinks they shouldn't be doing this, well, then, they probably shouldn't.  Come to think of it, this plan was originally one of Spike's, which probably means that they really shouldn't do it.  Unfortunately, Alex is trying to save the world.  He doesn't really have time for words like 'shouldn't.'
~ Bob silently cursed every word he could think of from the 13th century onward.
~
“You know Bobby’s going to attempt a full-on exorcism.”
“Then I guess it’s a good thing I’m not possessed.”
~ “Have you two hit the bottle already?”
“No,” they responded simultaneously, which Chloe took to mean yes. 
~ “Sorry for Jack, by the way,” the Doctor said. “Just in advance. We haven’t had a spare minute to get the ‘sorry about him’ t-shirts made up yet.”
~
“Uh,” she said, “I’m not totally sure - it’s my sister’s apartment - but I don’t think we have gas.” “Bet you’ve got electricity, though.” “But you said there was a leak?” He didn’t hesitate for more than maybe half a second; Dawn was impressed. “Very dangerous, electricity leaks. Won’t take half a mo to sort it out. Got two top-level electricity engineers with me and everything.”
~ "If I ask her to," John replied. "Cameron can beat up everybody in this bar if I asked." "Everybody in this bar right now watches Battlestar and owns ewok blankets. Beating them up is not that impressive."
~ And then Hot Guy’s fangs are going for Slightly Less Hot Guy’s neck and something like instinct takes over and she swings the machete and okay, okay, there is no way she should have a Beheading Hot Guys instinct.
~ “Is this... Ryan or Sharpay Evans?” her voice asks, and whoa, okay, that’s weird. Not that the rest of this day has been totally normal or anything, but that is really weird. “Because if it is, you need to know that having nametags sewn into your socks is not cool. It’s kind of helpful when other people get switched into your bodies and don’t know who the hell they are, but it’s not cool.”
~ As he watches Dean pirouette across the stage, Sam ponders how exactly his life has gotten to the level of weirdness where there’s room for phrases like ‘as he watches Dean pirouette across the stage’ in it. He thinks the fact that Dean’s in someone else’s body might actually make it less weird, because thinking about Dean’s body twirling away up there is just making his head hurt.
~ “Then what’s stopping you?”
Chloe shrugged, leaning her head on her hand as it grasped the chain of the swing. 
“That’s a great reason,” Dean commented sarcastically, folding his arms across his chest. She frowned at him, to which he smirked in reply. “You wanted honesty, princess.”
~ "C. J., oh, thank God you're in town," said a frantic female voice on the other end. "I don't know who else I would have called, but you've been through a Congressional investigation before –" C. J. looked up at Charlie, whose alarmed expression must have mirrored her own. 
"Ainsley," she interrupted, "this might be a good time for me to mention that you're on speakerphone."
~ “For anyone else, this would be a new low. Sadly, for you, it’s just a new middle.”
~
“It’s awesome times awesome. It’s awesome squared. It’s like: Hi. We’re the Awesomes. Have you met our children, Totally and Freaking?”
~ “If the Flintstones taught us anything, it’s that pelicans can be used to mix cement.”
~ “I’ve seen teams suck before, but they were just the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked.”
~ “I’m better than dirt. Well, most sorts of dirt. Not that fancy, store-bought stuff though. It’s hard to compete with that.”
~ “Me? Fail English? That’s unpossible.”
~
“Did you just ask if there’s a comic based on the X-men movie?!”
~ “Yes! Yes squared, in all caps with three exclamation points and a smiley-face emoticon.”
~ He winked at her, and she burst into tears. The look of petrified horror on Dean's face was the most hilarious thing Sam had ever, ever seen. Ever.
~ He fidgeted, which was usually Dean language for 'I'm about to say something touchy feely and then get embarrassed and punch you somewhere painful'.
~ He frowned, poking in annoyance at the lingering sunburn on his nose. "I never burned back then." "Freckled, though," Sam reminded him, helpfully.
~ “F'ckn hate fake chicken,” he mutters, and Sam feels himself grinning like a lunatic. “It was that or cream of mushroom,” he says happily. “No mushrooms,” Dean tells him, and opens his eyes. “Am I in the bathub?” When Sam nods, he looks thoughtful for a moment. “My head hurts,” he says finally, and yawns. “And these blankets smell like ass.” Discreetly, Sam moves a pair of dirty underwear away from Dean's ear. “I had to get you warm.” Dean scowls at him sleepily. “I'm still cold. And tired. And my head hurts. Go away.” Sam can't stop grinning at him. He tries, but it's just not working. “Okay, man. Go back to sleep.” Dean snorts faintly and does. After a few seconds a quiet snore is echoing in the weird bathroom acoustics.  Sam slithers off the side of the bathtub and sprawls back on the tiles, leaning against the toilet and staring at the ceiling. Tomorrow he's going to make fun of Dean until he cries.  “Gotta extrapolate the Zeppelin,” Dean murmurs, his eyes flickering under the lids.
~ “Who is this?” “Mo-om,” Rory groans. Lorelai has on the old, crabby-lady voice which means Rory is going to have to jump through hoops to actually start a conversation.  “This sounds vaguely like a daughter I once had but I have to dredge the memories up from the mists of time as it’s been so long.” “I’ve been-”
‘Busy? Ha! And you said that home teach-yourself-to-be-a-psychic kit was a waste of money! Or… are you becoming predictable in your twilight years?”
~ Lane answers the phone in the middle of telling someone no, don’t stick that in your mouth! “One of the twins?” Rory hazards.  “No, Zack,” Lane says, her voice a strange mix of resignation and affection. After Rory had described her predicament, Lane asks, “Are you requiring cheerleader-Lane or the you-don’t-want-to-hear-this Lane?” Rory knocks the phone in her hand against her temple a couple of times before answering. “Cautiously optimistic Lane?” Rory tries and hears a snort from the other side.
“Sorry, you only get wild enthusiasm with no regard for actual facts, or… the facts.”
~ Stupid ass, Dean gasped. Jumping in the way being all heroic and… stupid. Dean could never come up with the good insults when he was well and truly panicked.
~ Dear Olivia, It’s all very well laying a salt line between your two pillars, but you might want to think about the fact that those walls between you and the ghost only go halfway to the ceiling. What, you think a ghost couldn’t get over that or something? I have it on good authority that the ghost team wins the high jump every year at the supernatural Olympics. Hell, the demon team even spiked their water cooler with salt, once, and they still won. So, you know. You’re toast, and stuff.
~ Dear Dean, As awesome as it is having Meg back, given that you are currently fighting against the ghosts of people you failed to save, and that you know she’s dead because you saw her die, don’t you think you should, I don’t know, shoot her?  FOR GOD’S SAKE, MAN. STOP APOLOGISING TO THE ANGRY SPIRIT AND START FIGHTING BACK. WHAT THE EVERLOVING FUCK. Remember back when you used to make smart-ass remarks at ghosts who tried to engage you in conversation, and then figured out a way to get your gun back rather than just lying around on the floor looking pained? Those were the days, right? …
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP TALKING TO THE GHOSTS. THEY ARE DEAD. THEY DO NOT COMPREHEND REASON. THEY ARE ONLY THERE TO FURTHER LOWER YOUR SELF-ESTEEM, AND NOBODY WANTS THAT. Yours, in capslock,
~ OK, so I was spoiled for this episode, both for the lack of Sam and for the premise, plus a bunch of people told me how much they weren’t looking forward to it and how ridiculous it looked. Now, normally I would be pissed off by this, but in this case, it meant I went into the episode expecting to hate it. And it was AWESOME. Guys, it was awesome! So, you know, my new plan is to go into every episode thinking it’s going to suck, and if you guys wanted to spoil me for next week by telling me how much you aren’t looking forward to it, that would be totally OK. Any spoilers apart from “next week is going to suck” and “holy crap, cheese wheels” are STILL NOT OK. 2. But it was awesome, right? After last week, I was having a general feeling of concern grading into apathy about Show, but man, my squee has been fully reignited. 3. I can’t believe I just said “my squee has been fully reignited”. Am I even speaking English? Jesus.
~ OK, time is fluid but you can bend it? Uh, you know you can’t actually bend fluids, right?
~ “They blew up Azkaban?” Hermione asked with a frown. “Why would they do something so ridiculous?”
“We’re not sure,” Harry said. “But I’m pretty sure it was to, oh, I don’t know, rescue us?”
“Ah,” Hermione said with the same disapproving tone. 
~ “I’m not mad at him,” Hermione said in a voice that said yes, yes she WAS mad at him.
~ “Mr. Weasley,” Hermione said in an acidic tone, “didn’t want us to come to this universe after you.” She said this as if it explained everything. Harry waited exasperatedly for her to continue. “He,” she continued when she saw the look on Harry’s face, “said that Ron and I are too connected with you, that the only reason we started dating is because we’re both in love with YOU.”
Harry just stared at her. When he realized that this was IT, the reason they were angry with each other, he started laughing. When Ron thwacked him on the arm to shut him up, he only laughed hard, clutching his sides to keep from exploding. He fell back against the grimy wall, felt the wallpaper stick to his shirt, but he kept laughing so hard that tears creased from his eyes.
“He t-thinks you’re…” he laughed harder. Ron was blushing, glaring at the wall.
“He didn’t mean it literally!” Ron said. “He meant that Hermione and my worlds kind of… kind of circle around you, when you’re in danger, when bad things happen. And he meant that we’re a little too obsessed with keeping you safe and he THOUGHT that us going to this other universe to find you was just more proof that Hermione and I needed to… to distance ourselves from you for a while so we could figure out who WE are, as a couple and as people and he just… STOP LAUGHING!”
~ “I’m… er, sorry?” Remus said, feeling like a caged animal. He’d never experienced a break-down quite like this and Arthur did not show any signs of slowing down. In fact, he seemed to be gathering steam now that Remus was listening. Hell, he could have been anyone by the looks of Arthur’s slightly crazed expression.
“It isn’t easy,” Arthur continued, “being a father to so many children. I love all of them but the stress…” he shook his head, “I can’t even tell you. Do you have any idea how many times Fred and George have blown up some form of school property?”
“Er…”
“329 times,” Arthur continued, “and do you have any idea how many times I have had to bail Charlie out of prison for trespassing on private property chasing animals that are more interested in burning his fingers off before letting him pet them?”
“I really wouldn’t know,” Remus said, searching for an exit.
~
“Don't puke on the C-4.”
~ The Auto Mower is like a giant Roomba for your lawn. The thing costs $2,000, but is more environmentally friendly than regular gas-powered lawnmowers. Plus regular lawn mowers don't look like they'd chase you around and try to kill you. Would you seriously want a giant robot with spinning blades roaming freely around your home?
~
From the diary, quote, "I killed her. She's been killed. I'm a killer, an ace killer." That particular entry is not awash with ambiguity.
~ “Stop messing with my hair, Kal! Isn’t it like a Goth law that you can’t be up and perky at this hour?”
“Goths have no laws, only guidelines, and the true measure of coolness is your ability to break them without losing your essential Goth-ness,” his sister replied, darting her hand out faster than his eye could follow and mussing his hair again. “You, on the other hand, dear brother, shall suffer the curse of the super-curl today, since you beat me to the bathroom first by some nefarious means.”
“Nefarious means?” Jason said archly. “No, I just woke up first because my butt was hanging off the bed. I almost fell on the floor, thanks to you.”
She snorted and slid past him into the bathroom like a queen to her throne. “Sometimes I worry about you, Jase. Every boy in school would just love to wake up next to me, and all you do is complain.” On that note, she shut the door in his face and locked it.
“Yeah, I’m your brother,” he shot back, thumping the door irritably. “You’ve been hogging my space since the womb. Trust me, Kal, the thrill’s long since worn off.”
~ “Nickel for the cursing jar,” Clark reminded her mildly as she passed him.
“Bite me, I haven’t had my second cup of coffee yet,” was her blasé reply. “It doesn’t count at this hour. Even if it did, I prepaid this week.”
~
"It's impolite to teleport into another person’s private space without their permission," he said, with a measured voice.
~ “Remind me why we're doing this again,” the Doctor mumbles to the woman beside him, not turning his head.
“Because,” she says, likewise looking not at him but staring ahead with forced patience, a fixed beaming smile on her face, “you said you wanted one of those cakes with the little people on top so you could see what you'd look like made outta icing.”
The Doctor scowls. “Nobody told me those little people are actually made of plastic. And it doesn't even look like me!”
~
“Hi there! I’m not with security, I’m just pretending I am for today. Well, as you probably know by now, we’re run into some technical difficulties, so to avoid being eaten alive, I suggest that everybody run like hell for the nearest exits and not look back. Thank you for visiting the San Diego Zoo, and have a nice day!”
~
"Uh . . . not hurting, so at the moment, roughly like eleven million bucks." Alec watched as they all blinked at him. "Half of what I'm normally worth?" They were still missing the train. "Like shit. I feel like shit, but it could be worse. I could feel like shit and hurt. God, are you guys slow? I'm the one that's got a head full of bad genes, loose wiring, and a bloodstream filled with lead. Get with the program."
~
"Dude, you're allergic to chocolate?" Dean was horrified. "Your rights to be my clone have been revoked."
~
"Not hungry." It might have been possible for Sam to sulk more, but it would have required a college course and a detailed instruction manual.
"Don't care." Dean's grin was obnoxious.
Sam looked over at Collin. "Don't look for help from me. You look like shit. Eat the sandwich, drink your sugar." He paused while Sam scowled. "Then plunk your ass on that other bed and sleep."
Sam's eyes skipped to Alec, who was working on his second sandwich. Apparently Dean had made the right call about his calorie intake. "Dude, don't look at me. I'm drugged up and unreliable." Alec grinned, and it was frighteningly similar to Dean’s.
"You all suck." Sam pouted but cracked opened the soda.
~
“Pace myself? Believe me, I’m a lot more obnoxious sober.”
~
Reading Twilight is working like a charm for poking my muse. She's sitting in a corner of my brain grumbling, "Oh, for fuck's sake, I could do better than this."
~
“I always forget how much I want to hit this girl with a shovel. It's like she had a word-a-day calendar on her desk as she was writing it. "Oh, 'surreptitiously'! I can use that today!"”
“Oh, I like syrup.”
“I mean, for crying out loud ... wait, did you just say, "I like syrup"?”
“...a little, yeah.”
~ “The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try to take over the world.” (A few seconds later in another text ...) “...of warcraft.”
~
“Wow, I didn't think people still named their kids Chuck or, um, Morgan for that matter.”
“My parents were sadists; and carnival freaks found him in a dumpster.”
“But they raised me as one of their own.”
~ “You shoot him, I shoot you, I leave both your bodies here and go out for a late night snack. I'm thinking maybe pancakes.”
~
“This is how this is gonna work. I'm gonna go over there, rescue Sarah, capture Dr. Zarnow, shoot anybody who gets in my way. You, you're gonna stay here.”
“So in this plan I basically do nothing? Let’s do this.”
~ “I heard Big Mike threw down the gauntlet, just wanted to come by and say 'I wanted to help.' But A, I lack the skill set, and B, old computers give me the willies. You have no idea how much courage it's taking just to stand here.”
~ “How was I supposed to know that she had a remote control jet ski? It's usually not an option in real life.”
~
“God, Sarah, you're so pretty! And Casey, your jaw was chiseled by Michelangelo himself.”
~
“Get back or I will kill him”
“I would just hate for you to kill a random stranger I don't know.”
~
“You’re going to come with me because I assume you find me imposing. Don't worry, you can be honest. I'm going for imposing.”
“Mission accomplished.”
~
“I’m making that chicken with balsamic glaze, the one thing that dad taught me to make…”
“But dad couldn’t cook either.”
~
“I’m just going to sit here, you know, alone. Not technically, but, you know, emotionally.”
~ “Well, I can’t say that bondage has ever been my thing, really, but I guess I’m always up for trying something new,” she said with as much humor as she could manage.
She swore she could hear his smile as he asked, “And how are you liking it so far?”
She sighed dramatically. “I have to say it’s highly overrated. What do you say we get out of here?”
“I’d love to,” he answered honestly, and she could hear some sort of muffled sound behind her that she guessed to be caused by him testing the strength of the duct tape that likely bound his hands just as it bound hers. “Any ideas?”
She had to give him credit: he was doing a pretty good job of pretending to be unconcerned. She didn’t know if her forced levity was keeping him calm or if his lack of panic was due to his nonchalant replies – or both – but she definitely appreciated the effort. “I’m working on it,” she answered. “On the other hand, I’m the one who suggested ‘let’s get out of here’ so, so far, I’m the only one pulling my weight. You should feel welcome to pitch in if anything comes to mind.”
“I’ll try to remember that,” he said through a grunt.
~ “Seriously?” she said, loud enough for him to hear. “Do you know this is the third time in a month that my source has tried to kill me?!”
~
"Dude, you think I did this?" Dean splutters, because he's good when it comes to the prank wars, but he isn't that good. "You think I trained birds to dress you in the morning?"
~ "That how you messed up your ankle?" he asked, motioning down to it.
She winced, looking down at the bootless foot. "My landing wasn't quite as stealthy as I'd hoped."
He nodded, bending down beside her foot. "You seen any way out of here?" he wondered.
"You mean the bright red exit sign I ignored to happily sit on the floor? Yeah, of course!"
~ "Wanna know what I'm wearing?"
She chuckled. "No," she said simply. She was pretty sure she already knew.
"You're no fun when you're tired."
"Well maybe if you hadn't woken me up unexpectedly at midnight, I'd be more interesting." She yawned, running a hand threw her tangled hair. "I've had a looong day." She let her eyes close and slid further down into her bed, pulling the comforter up. "Between Isis and this piece I've been working on, I feel like I'm constantly on auto-pilot..." She laughed rather sadly. "I don't even know what day it is today... I just knew I had to be at work... Because I'm always at work."
"You're a real downer, sometimes," he said honestly. "And it's Wednesday."
"Thank you," she muttered, rolling her eyes.
"The twelfth," he added.
"Helpful."
"Of November."
She rolled her eyes. "Okay, I get-" Her brows furrowed. "Wait a sec..." She sat up in her bed, head tipped to the side. "Oh my god... is it my birthday?"
"Ding, ding, ding," he replied nonchalantly.
Her lips curved in a smile. "That's why you called, isn't it?" She shook her head. "Dean... Did you wait until midnight so it would officially be my birthday?"
He cleared his throat. "No... That's just a very unusual coincidence," he assured. "I remembered when you brought up your workaholic ways and lack of memory."
~ She stared at him, brows lifted with slight surprise. "You're right."
He smirked. "Yeah, occasionally I think with my upstairs brain."
~ "This isn't a chick flick moment," he told her warningly. She grinned, stepping nearer. He lifted a hand. "Don't make this sappy!"
~
“Apparently, it's called ‘surveillance’…Doesn't sound very manly.”
~ "I told you not to teach him how to shoot until he was at least thirteen!"
"I thought you said she wasn't gonna be home ‘til five," she heard him mutter to the taller man at his left.
"That's what she said," Sam replied defensively.
~ “Come on, you know it’s true. We’ve been friends for over six years, you stay at my house, I stay at yours. I remember your birthday—” “Your assistant remembers my birthday,” she corrected, dropping back into the rocker. Tony continued as if he hadn’t been interrupted, “We’ve traveled all over the world together. Remember that trip to Bali?” “I do, but I’m pretty sure you don't.” Considering how much he’d had to drink, he probably didn’t.  Ignoring her chilly tone, he exclaimed, “That was a great time!” “You have got to be kidding.” Her voice was a study in disbelief. “You had fun!” “I was almost killed!” “Yeah, but you weren’t, and now we can look back at it and laugh.” “Yes that’s exactly what I do: think back and laugh,” she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.  “And we’re business partners!”  “We’ve been partners for all of fifteen minutes!” “What am I always telling you, Birdie? It’s quality, not quantity.”
~ “I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker.”
~ “No, I’m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.”
~ “I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History, and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs.”
~
“Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.”
~ “I don’t guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation. Although, as I’m saying this, it occurs to me that you may have been employing a rhetorical device, rendering my response moot.”
~ “While Mr. Kim, by virtue of youth and naiveté, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me.”
~ “Yes, well, I’m polymerized tree sap and you’re an inorganic adhesive, so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns to its original trajectory and adheres to you.”
~ “At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together and reduce the resulting particular chaos to tears.”
~ “Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She's interfering with my sleep, she's interfering with my work... and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I'm sure she'd be interfering with that too.”
~ Whether the device wasn't too accurate to begin with, or my presence was interfering with it, the enemy headcount had been wrong, and it surprised me none that it wasn't in our favor.
~
“Shawn!” Gus barked at his friend, appalled. “I am not a mutant. I’m black. There is a difference.”
~ “Yeah, but we’re going undercover.” Gus looked at him sharply. “There will be no covers, Shawn. Under or otherwise.”
~ Bobby cursed, his frown deepening. “Pyro. What’s he doing here?” Shawn made a face and shook his head. “With a name like Pyro… and this is just a guess… but I think he’s probably the one making those!” Shawn stalked to the edge of the roof and gestured at the pillars of fire.
~ Shawn stayed crouched, rocking slightly as he glared at Bobby. “I can’t die here. I’ve got things to do! I’ve never been married! I’ve never climbed Mt. Everest! I’ve never danced naked in the moonlight!” For a second, Bobby’s expression lost its tense look and he grinned at Shawn. “If I get you out of here, just promise I won’t be there for that last one.”
~
“Great! Does anyone want any coffee or anything to go with tonight’s helping of truth and justice?”
~ “And if anyone has anything weird… like horns! We’re leaving if someone has horns.” “Gus…” “And don’t get me started on anyone who can talk to bugs. This bar is downtown. They probably have cockroaches the size of dogs.” “Bugs?” For a moment, Shawn looked totally nonplussed. “Do you really think someone could do that?” “I didn’t think guys could fly or sprout knives from their hands a week ago.” “Good point.” Shawn conceded. “If we see any dog sized cockroaches, we’ll leave.”
~
“He would be my nemesis, if he could spell it.”
~
“Every Saturday since we’ve lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter-cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America, and watched Doctor Who.”
“Penny’s still sleeping.”
“Every Saturday since we’ve lived in this apartment…”
“You have a TV in your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed?”
“Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother’s Day.”
~
“He irks me. He is irksome.”
~
"WANKER," said James, and socked Sirius in the stomach. Remus had to admit that Sirius' return blow was unexpectedly forceful, but sighed as both boys fell to the floor, scrabbling as if possessed - cursing, punching, scratching, and grunting like the circus Erumpents pressed into Sumo wrestling on weekends near Bournemouth. It was the seventh fight between the boys since Saturday.  "Sirius' right-hook's getting better," Remus offered, glancing in Peter's direction. "Wriggly bastard too," Peter noted. "James bites, though." "Yeah." Peter slid off his bed and stood beside Remus. "Bit of an advantage that."
~
It appeared that his nerve under pressure and the cold desperation of his last stand had met with approval, and the Giants were particularly fascinated by his magic wand - or, as they insisted on describing it, "his tiny stick" (Unfair! thought Snape, it's a full twelve and a half inches - a very respectable size for a wizard of my age!). The minstrel from the previous night whispered in his ear that Rawh-turrh-guugg, famous composer of drinking songs, was improvising a new piece: The Ballad of Severus the Small and his Tiny, Tiny Stick. He translated the words for Snape as the song progressed - by the time Gunilla showed up at the table it had reached a total of seventeen verses, twelve of which were very rude.
~ "And they are not my friends. They are my evil minions - they cower in my presence!" he announced hotly. "Cower, dammit!" he hissed at the Death Eaters, who shied away in the appropriate manner.
~
“They are now part of the game, and they face the same fate, should you all fail to answer.” Harry looked at the other two in dismay. 
“Well, we didn’t come barging in here just to brush dust off your robes,” Ron said, almost huffily. “We rather figured we’d be facing mortal peril.” 
“This is you we’re talking about,” Hermione added. 
~ He pulled out his wand and transfigured a lint ball from his pocket into a beetle. The other three gave him weird looks.
“James.” Sirius said slowly, as if explaining to a very stupid child. “People usually flip coins to make decisions. Not beetles.”
“I don’t know how to make a coin, okay?” James snapped, looking embarrassed. “So we’re flipping a beetle. It’s dead anyway. Peter, you call it.” he flipped it into the air.
“Uh…legs!” Peter said. James caught it and slapped it down on his arm. Remus snorted.
“Intelligent, James. Now it’s squashed on your arm.”
~ "Go splinch yourself," Snape said pleasantly.
~ Jess snorted. “If I had spies, I wouldn’t waste them spying on you.”
~ Tell Dwight I coughed on his pencils. No, wait. Just on one of his pencils. But I’m not telling him which one.
~
“I think we need to explore whether this attempted murder was a hate crime.”
“What as opposed to one of those I-really-really-like-you sort of murders?”
~
“You great… soft… sissy… girlie… nancy… French… bender… Man United supporting POOF!” he yelled, accentuating each word with a vicious punch. 
~
“Anything happens to this car, I'll come 'round your houses and stamp on all your toys. Got it? Good kids.”
~ "Missing Admiral?" Abby echoed. "How do you misplace an Admiral? They're like, important and stuff."
~ The monkeys were, in fact, juggling.
~ The clock on the wall above the shop door struck midnight and shouted twelve rude insults before falling silent.
~ "But everybody knows." The old man seemed truly bewildered. "It is impossible not to know, young man. Inconceivable." Sirius inhaled slowly. Just pretend to be Remus, he told himself. Patience. Politeness. "Let's say I don't know," he said lightly.
~ "I could kill you. You know the stories." Its English was perfect, cultured, more like a professor or a scholar than a bloodthirsty creature. It added, somewhat petulantly, "Everybody else believes the stories."
~ Sirius Black enrolled in Muggle Studies because James Potter bet him four Butterbeers, half a year's subscription to Witches and Wenches, twenty-three Chocolate Frogs, and the password to the Ravenclaw girls' Quidditch locker room that he wouldn't survive one term in the classroom of Professor Tuttle D. Kipfer. All of the professors at Hogwarts had their quirks. Professor Mirador wept with joy when one of her predictions came true, and the Hufflepuff fourth years had pitched in to buy her a set of lovely embroidered handkerchiefs. A complicated wagering scheme had developed over when Professor Kettleburn would lose his next limb (odds were 35:1 in favour of the left leg during the Slytherin second years' Tuesday morning class in mid-May). Professor Kipfer, too, had his quirks. He hated purebloods. He hated students. He hated the other professors. He hated small children, purring kittens, daisies, teacups, rainbows, holidays, cinnamon, sunrises, shiny coins, laughter, patchwork quilts, and music. In fact, Professor Kipfer hated everything that (he believed) stood between himself and his ultimate goal of Overthrowing The Oppressive Pureblood Menace That Has Trampled On The Rights Of Witches and Wizards For Thousands Of Years And Heralding The Magical World Into A New Age Of Truth, Justice And Equality. On a wall in Professor Kipfer's classroom there was a list that filled over twelve feet of parchment and stretched from the ceiling to the floor right next to the blackboard. At the top of the list, in the professor's tiny handwriting, were the words: Here follows a Comprehensive Detailing of Criminals, Perpetrators, and Vile Offenders who thwart the Cause of Freedom.
~ After the first week of classes third year, Sirius returned to the dormitory in a whirlwind of anger. He broke the bathroom mirror, ripped the curtains from James' bed, threw all of Peter's shoes out the window, then turned Remus' broom into a pitchfork and impaled his own pillow until the filling fled in silent, downy surrender.
~ Dean’s invisible. Dad said to meet in a week, but Dean's thinking it might take a bit longer given that every time he tries to drive, he starts a brand new urban legend about a ghost car, and if it ever turns out that he has to investigate himself he might die from the irony. For maybe two seconds while he's pulling into Bobby's driveway Dean considers pulling pranks on the old guy like how he did to Sam that time all those years ago. (But Sammy is in Stanford, ungrateful bastard, not even a backward glance – and Dean is mature now, he is above all that bullshit. He is going to deal with this problem of the occult in an adult manner – which, no, he doesn't mean in the porno way.)
~ Sam's girlfriend has this preternatural sense: she can tell when he's thinking 'My girlfriend is hot.' She smirks when he thinks it, which is a lot of the time, but also whaps him upside the head and says, "I have a name, stop thinking 'my girlfriend' you loser." Sam gapes at Jess, because he's never really sure how the hell she knows when he's objectifying her in his head. 
~
"Dancing." She says it like it should be obvious; Sam just shakes his head.  "Jess. You look like something's trying to kill you. Like, from the inside."
~ Sometimes Shawn thinks he must have been born under a lucky star, because that is the only thing that explains him. And then he remembers that his father is Henry Spencer. Which rules luck right out, but perhaps the universe is inherently benevolent after all, and all of the good fortune it throws Shawn’s way is tacit apology for having been raised by such a man. 
~
“They were just lying there… abandoned, unloved!” Shawn says. “I am giving them a worthy home. In my stomach.” Lassiter looks as if his internal organs pain him, as if his intestines are reaching up their looping lengths to his throat to strangle him from the inside, he is so infuriated by Shawn.
~
Switched the salt in the salt shaker for sugar. And then, for good measure, switched the sugar in the sugar canister for salt. (This will come back to haunt him in two weeks, when his father surprises him with homemade pineapple spice cookies. Shawn is too surprised and touched by the gesture to admit that the cookies are horrifically salty and instead eats them with tall glasses of milk.) (Henry never admits that he knows of Shawn’s sugar-salt switch, and that this is his own oblique way of getting revenge. Some fathers and sons go golfing together. This is what the Spencer men do, instead.)
~ "Mahkehs!" Sammy pronounces gleefully as he digs up the pack from the side pocket of the duffel. If only for the sake of their last name, John hopes his younger son will someday embrace the letter R, apparently the most elusive in the alphabet.
~ Dean thinks they’re okay until Sam comments on the size of his antlers.  “Seriously, dude… have those always been there?” Sam is staring at him, squinty-eyed and slightly suspicious. It’s been one of those days, so Dean doesn’t feel like too much like a dumbass when he reaches up to grope his head. Sure enough, no antlers. This would be more of a relief if the realization wasn’t immediately followed by the sound of six feet plus of little brother hitting the dirt. Fucking pixies.
~ Anyway. Sam can’t walk a straight line and twice he’s stopped mid-sentence to very solemnly wish Dean a Merry Christmas. All in all, it’s only moderately annoying and Dean figures he can just herd Sam into the motel room and wait for the pixie-high to pass.
~ “People say they’re ‘overwhelmed’, some even say they’re ‘underwhelmed’.  But you never hear people say that they’re just ‘whelmed’,” Dean explains. “If you can be ‘over-’ or ‘under-’ ‘whelmed’, then ‘whelmed’ has to be a real word.  But what the fuck does it mean?  I’ve never heard anyone use it.”
~ “You think getting hit by flying furniture is amusing?”
“No,” Sam explains.  “It’s just, you called it a candelabrum.”
“Well that’s what it was….”
“You could have called it a candleholder or stick or something, but you specifically said it was a candelabrum.”
~ Sam heaves a big sigh before Dean can even speak. “You have short-term memory loss. We don’t know what caused it. I’m trying to find out.” Dean shuts his mouth, opens it again, but isn’t sure what to ask. Maybe he’s already asked everything. He wonders how much time has passed that he can’t remember. He wonders how many times Sam’s had to explain this.
~ “Bobby thinks the memory loss isn’t permanent.” Sam’s lips quirk into a smile. “His exact words were, his memory will be as bad as ever.” “Remind me to kick Bobby’s ass for that,” Dean stalks over to Sam. “When you know, I forget.”
~ “You ate a cursed muffin and it gave you short-term memory loss and it will be fixed when it’s out of your system.” Sam delivers this all in one breath, as if he’s nervous he won’t be able to get to the end of his sentence. “Which means we have to have this conversation every ten minutes for the next 24 hours.” Sam reaches for one of the balled up pieces up paper in the waste paper basket, and pulls it out. “I might need a sign, I’m gonna get bored saying this.” He grabs a pen and scrawls something on the paper that Dean can’t see.
~ He opens his mouth to say something and Dean cuts him off with, "I swear to God, if you say, but it's a dry heat, I will shoot you myself." "I think they think if they keep repeating that it's not so bad, they'll convince themselves it isn't."
~ The sign says, Be a Nite Owl! on the first line, and Midnite Madness at the Bowl-More! on the second. Sam is muttering something about the deterioration of public education and the inability of people to spell things correctly leading to the downfall of civilization, but Dean is used to that.
~ "Dude. Seriously. We're not doing the last speech thing here because (a) you're not going to die and (b) I am so not having that socially awkward conversation with dad. Ever. So shut up and let me figure out how I'm going to get you back up here."
~ “All right, I know it’s Halloween, but that was just a little too strange. Has the entire wizarding world gone bananas?”
“Very possibly,” came Oliver’s voice from behind him. “Teddy Lupin, for instance, has now been sighted talking to himself.”
Teddy stopped on the spot and spun around. “Julia was just here!”
“Now he’s spinning on the spot and shouting things,” he continued to commentate to Winnie, who was trying hard not to look amused.
Teddy stared at the pair, looking unimpressed. “Am I the only one concerned with the state of chaos everything is falling into?”
“No,” Oliver said, grinning, “but you’re fun to egg on. Isn’t he Winnie?”
“Yes. If only I had some actual eggs to throw at him,” she said, pointedly not looking at Teddy.
~ I crept over to the boarded up window and peeked outside. “That? That would be a hoard of zombies.”
“I’m sorry,” Max said in what I had come to recognize as her don’t-mess-with-me voice. “But I could have sworn you just said zombie.”
~
“Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click "Yes, I am 18"? Even a 17 year old can figure it out.”
~ “It’s not a racial thing, it’s cultural. I have more in common with them, like, I assume you only date emotionally stunted bigots.”
~ “You're the doctor, I'm the mother; I outrank you, live with it.”
~ “I thought I'd get your theories, mock them, then embrace my own. The usual.”
~
“I was curious. Since I'm not a cat, that's not dangerous.”
“I don't think that metaphor was actually designed to warn cats.”
~
“Why are you suspicious?”
“Because it's either that, or accept the fact that you've done something nice, and then I have to deal with the horsemen, and the rain of fire, and the end of days.”
~
“Did you just see a blond guy with a pretentious accent?”
“Can't see an accent.”
~
“Dr. Cuddy? I'm Amber Volakis, one of Dr. House's new fellows...”
“Sexual harassment claims go through HR, stress-related leaves through workers' comp., and any accusations of criminal activity go directly to the Princeton-Plainsboro Police Department.”
~ “If I have to walk somewhere, there better be at least five girls involved. And they’d better be working their way through college.”
~
“Who were you going to kill in Bolivia? My old housekeeper? Oh, I'm sorry - who were you going to marginalize? If it is my housekeeper, she has it coming. Cleaning the windows means cleaning both sides.”
~
“Hypothetical situation, a woman drops something in public and instead of laughing it off she gets nervous and erratic.”
“Maybe she's nervous because she didn't do her spelling homework. In my hypothetical she's 8.”
~
“You're wearing that shirt for someone.”
“The health department. They frown on topless oncology.”
~
“Because I wanna ask you about your girlfriend. I must know who she is, or you would’ve told me her name.”
“She doesn’t have a name, it’s some sort of... birth defect.”
“There’s only about 12 people we both know. I can’t remember 5 of their names. So we’re down to Cuddy, your ex wives...”
“Your mama.”
~ “People don't change. For example, I'm going to keep repeating "People don't change."”
~ “She's nuts, but we can't just give her 10 cc's of atheism and send her home.”
~ “If you really want to stop car accidents, take out the air bags and attach machetes pointing at their throats. Everyone will drive three miles an hour.”
~
“Give him five minutes. Brainstorming a few possibilities isn't going to explode his brain.”
“And if she's wrong, that makes this phone call that much more exciting.”
~ Stop looking around suspiciously. To answer your next two questions, no I am not there, and yes, you are completely predictable
~ Chuck bounced in the backseat. “So we really are dealing with a real-life vampire? That’s so neat! And seasonal.”
~ "He doesn't even believe in ghosts," Chuck confided. "Can you believe that? Who doesn't believe in ghosts?"  "I don't believe in ghosts," Peter said helpfully.
~ "It was a boarding school," Ned said. "We had to wear uniforms and there weren't a lot of opportunities for cool nick names. I was also once called Pie-Boy, but I'm sure that's not relevant to this line of questioning at all."
~ “The less I know about….” Matt flicked a hand in a gesture Sam wasn’t sure was supposed to indicate but probably encompassed everything he’d ever dealt with in life. “The better, y’know?”
~ Sam rolls his eyes and reaches back into his duffle, retrieving and shaking the horse in Dean’s direction. “Snoob,” he repeats and oh yeah, Dean wonders how he could’ve forgotten that. How their father had tried to make Sammy name the horse something else but he’d refused, bawling every time their father had suggested alternate names. It could’ve been worse. John had had no idea that the horse’s original name had in fact been Mister Pinkle Snooby Pants and it’d already taken a lot of convincing and Dean’s last bag of super-secret emergency gummi worms for Sam to shorten it.
~ "Death bots? Why must you re-name everything that tries to kill us?" D'Argo demanded, popping up from the cover of several abandoned oversized desert buggies to take a few more shots at their pursuers.
"Because I don't know or give a damn what a Cylon is, and it's good stress relief," John claimed, ducking around one of the giant wheels on the wreck they were hiding behind. "If I have to think about a nickname, I don't think about how many there are or how shiny they are or how they kinda freak me out and remind me of Arnold Schwarzennegger."
"Did this Arnold try to kill you back on Earth?"
"What? No. No one ever tried to kill me on Earth," John panted as they ran for shelter behind another vehicle. "Why do you think I want to go back there so bad?" He collapsed at the edge of the giant truck, then looked behind them. "D'Argo? We've run out of stuff to hide behind. Got any ideas? Why, oh why, can't they just-- oh. Ohhh, boy. D'Argo? I think I found us a way out."
D'Argo spun around, then gaped at what John was pointing at. "Absolutely not."
"Oh, come on. It's either the big blue swirly hole that just opened up fifty feet away—" John gestured to the wormhole that somehow, someway, had arrived to save their butts, "— or the Barbies and the Deathbots fry you and fricasee me. It can't be worse than this, man."
"I loathe wormholes," D'Argo grumbled. "And I intend to kill you once we land."
"Five more minutes of life? Works for me."
~
His tall alien friend appeared to be cursing him out, with hand gestures, when the spiral spat out several more beings, specifically: three short brunet men wearing ugly red suits, four tall 'super-model types' as Michael would have called them, and a dozen large silver mechanical robots, all bearing weapons. The blue spiraling hole closed behind them, and disappeared as if a zipper had been pulled on the universe, concealing the static electricity that lay underneath.
~ "I'm afraid they believe I'm their God, now. It's an understandable mistake. But they won't be assisting you unless you offer up your surrender in the next ten minutes."
~ “Well,” said Sir Percy to the pamphlet, “that was another sign, wasn’t it?”
The pamphlet, being an inanimate object, was unable to agree with him.
~
“Are you in fact referring to Shakespeare, sir?”
“Probably,” said Sir Percy, whose time at Eton had only served to make him relatively sure that if he managed to say something intelligent it was the result of studying Shakespeare. “Or, you know, we might just have all gone barmy.”
~
“But it… it would ruin this carefully created ensemble!” Sir Percy protested.
“Sir,” Frank replied, in the carefully controlled tones of a tutor dealing with a particularly stupid child who had managed to glue himself to a wall, “you are wearing white culottes. You have twelve pairs of white culottes with you, and ten more back in England. There is absolutely nothing to differentiate your current trousers from any of the other pairs except for the enormous splatter of mud which, by the way, sir, already ruined your ensemble.” He glared at Sir Percy. “I shall get you another pair of culottes for the purposes of comparison. It will shock you to discover the difference between clean and dirty.”
~
“Think of the people in my closet!”
“I had hoped to avoid that mental image, sir. I think I may have to pour bleach in my ear to rid myself of it.”
“I’ll pay for it. We could wait?”
“The dinner gong should ring in a quarter of an hour,” Frank pointed out, sounding rather miffed. “Sir, there is very little time.”
“I suppose we can’t go off in search of the key to my room,” Sir Percy mused. “What shall we do, then?”
They settled for a very bad bit of loud improvisation.
“Well, Frank,” Sir Percy well nigh shouted into the keyhole. “It appears that I have muddied my riding breeches. I ought to change before dinner!”
“I HEARTILY AGREE, SIR,” Frank bellowed. Frank, though generally the soul of discretion, had the acting ability of a rock. “LET ME UNLOCK THE DOOR TO YOUR ROOM SO THAT YOU MAY GET CLEAN TROUSERS AND CHANGE!”
“That sounds like quite a good plan,” Sir Percy declared.
“I BELIEVE SO, SIR, THANK YOU.” They waited a few moments. Sir Percy checked his pocket watch. Blast, ten minutes to the dinner gong. “THE DOOR IS OPENING,” Frank announced. He nudged it open. “STILL OPENING. OPENING AGAIN! OH LOOK, NOW IT IS HALF-WAY OPEN. THREE-QUARTERS… THERE! IT IS OPEN NOW!”
“Masterfully done, Frank,” Sir Percy muttered.
Since the room was still empty, Frank bravely closed his eyes, opened the closet door and stuck an arm in. “I AM LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF WHITE KNEE BREECHES, A PAIR OF STOCKINGS, A LIGHT BLUE WAISTCOAT AND A DARKER BLUE COAT.” Someone very kindly put them into Frank’s hands and Sir Percy dressed as hurriedly as possible
~
“Bruce,” Dick ventured as he headed for one of the sleeping alcoves, “you’re not planning to wait until I’m asleep and then head off on your own, are you?” He didn’t wait for an answer. “Because if you are, as soon as I find out, I’m going to follow you there—and I’ll probably upset whatever plan you do cook up, because I won’t know what it is.”
~ “I didn’t mind helping you train the little pipsqueak until I found out that his final exam was supposed to be snapping my neck.”
“Untrue!” Damien shouted. “The method of your death was never specified.”
“You’re not helping your case, kid,” Jason snarled.
“It wasn’t!” The boy insisted. “I was actually planning to use a fast-acting poison, out of gratitude for your lessons. There would have been no pain—”
~ Jason sighed, visibly relieved. “Good. Where’s…”
“Facing insurmountable odds. Wanna help him triumph over them?”
~ “I considered legal action, until I realized suing a law firm might be like trying to rob a gun store with a knife.”
~
“The man hemorrhages money like a hemophiliac breakdancing on a bed of machetes.”
~ Chair offers GUARANTEED RESULTS. What are they? Nobody knows, exactly, but they’re obviously PRETTY GOOD. With all these CAPS, can you really afford NOT to buy it RIGHT NOW?!
~ If you want to give me a “gift” of some kind - like a butterfly, a pink striped thong, or an adorable panda - give it to me in real life. Yes, you heard me: give me a panda in real life. I will raise it in my apartment, it will quickly become enormous and unmanageable, and then yes, it will most likely go on a rampage in my building and kill several people before being put down by a team of animal control specialists. Do I want all this senseless carnage? No, but given the choice, I’ll take a building full of dead neighbors over receiving a tiny picture of a pair of socks as a “gift” on Facebook.

“Holy crap!” Carter jumped at least three feet at the first touch of one of them landing in her short blond hair, flailing her gun around in a way that violated several safety protocols, and then an avalanche poured down on them all, and the apocalypse had come.

“You know what would be really helpful, honey? If I had the slightest idea what you’re talking about.”
~ Michael hesitated. “Lucas kind of has a gift.”
Jaime stared at the pictures, trying to wrap his mind around what Michael was suggesting. “I think I’d give it back if I were him.”
~ “And he wasn’t exactly coherent when he came home that night.”
The first cop’s brow furrowed. “Drunk or concussion?”
“Probably,” Sam said agreeably before Dean could say anything.

He watches her walk away until he realizes he’s doing it.

“The chances of us surviving the rising temperature is one in a hundred, nintey seven thousand. That is so not good. Worst case scenario: when the temperature reaches 212 degrees, we boil alive in our own bodily fluids. Best case scenario: We’re unconscious before it happens.”

“You should have been here ten minutes ago. I was naked from the waist down.”
“Yeah, because he sat in pizza.”
“But the point is: naked. From the waist down.”

"He handles all the merchandising of Superman products, and I've had him putting the profits into an account for charity. I haven't actually done anything with it, though. I don't know much about setting up a foundation."
She opened the statement and her eyes widened as they tracked down the page. "Superman... this is a checking account."
Superman frowned at her, confused. "Uh, yeah. In case I wanted to, you know, give some money away, a check seemed like the easiest way. Should I have done something else?"
"What, you mean like stuffing it in your mattress? A ceramic piggy bank, maybe? You have millions of dollars here! In a checking account that's earning..." She skimmed down the page again. "...three percent interest."
"Oh. I guess I should have invested it?"
She sighed. "You weren't kidding when you said you didn't understand greed, were you?"
~
Susan: “If there is a God, then this is definitely the biggest test of my humanity! He’s just so—arg. He’s like the final boss, with a million lives that just keeps coming and each blow does so much damage that you’re almost dead. I have to level up, I don’t have experience to deal with this.”

Nik: “The dice are kind to you today.”

"Well, we don't want to pry, honey, and if it's none of our business you can tell us so," Martha said, surprising him. 
"Okay," he said quickly, grasping at the miraculous chance for escape. "It's none of your business."
"But you might feel better if you got this off your chest," she went on, as if he hadn't spoken. 
~ "Jonathan, go away," Martha ordered firmly, pushing her husband out the door and shutting it in his face.
"What about my dinner?" he asked plaintively, through the door.
"Go make a sandwich," Martha called.
~ "Cat's not the only woman who's noticed you. As a matter of fact, I overheard a couple of women in the restroom the other day composing a poem about a certain part of your anatomy."
The look on his face was priceless - a hilarious mixture of disbelief and mortification. "They were *what*!?"
"Not *that* part," she assured him, delighting in the blush that bloomed over his cheeks. 
He sighed and closed his eyes. "Can you give me a hint? One that maybe won't embarrass me into the next millennium?"
"Now where would be the fun in that?" she teased.
"Lo-is," he pleaded, and she so enjoyed the sound of him pleading with her that she gave in much more quickly than sheusually would.
"Okay," she said. "You're sitting on it." 
"I guess it's too much to hope that they were writing a poem about my chair." He opened his eyes and dared a peek at her. "There are lots of good rhymes with chair, you know. Air, fair, hair, bear, lair, square, dare...."
"Grass, pass, lass, sass, mass..." she countered.
"...blare, care - darn, this is getting harder - tear, pear..."
"Mutt, rut, putt, what, cut, lut..." she was laughing so hard she could hardly talk, let alone think of rhymes.
He was laughing, too. "Wait a minute! I need a judge's ruling on 'lut'. That's not a word."
~ The sound of the cow bell was coming closer and Rich was beginning to sing out, "Rise and shine! We're burning daylight here!"
"I don't think I like Rich," Lois stated. "I've given it a lot of thought and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to kill him. Would you help me hide the body or are you going to make me lug it around by myself in the interests of equality? Remember when I said that I didn't want you to fulfill my every little whim?"
"Yeah." Clark glanced over at her, debating whether he should get changed or not.
"I didn't mean it," Lois told him. "So if that bell suddenly goes missing, I promise I won't say a word."

“The ancient Greeks had a word for women like her.”

~ “I did jump off a roof once,” Remus admitted. “Although, in my defence, I was 9, it was my brother on the ground egging me on and my mother beat him for a week when she found out.”
Ginny laughed wryly, pointing her wand in Teddy's direction. “Five. No provocation whatsoever. I walk outside one day and he's jumping off the roof with Harry yelling directions from the ground.”
“There were brooms underneath!” Teddy called back indignantly.
~ "Dad's like that, too," Scorpius told them. "I say Potter and he says, 'Oh, aren't we having marvelous weather this March?'"
~ "My name's not prim," James said as Scorpius sniggered. "It's - manly. Attracts the ladies."
~ "Dad, I can explain," Scorpius said quickly. "I was abducted." "Of course," Draco said, his eyes on Harry. "Potter snuck in through your window, did he?"
"He's an Auror, Dad," Scorpius said, nodding. "He's got special powers! He can," he added in what he probably thought was a compelling tone, "bend people to his will."
"Can he?" Draco's lip was twitching.
"He's right," Harry said. "I lured him here to this dangerous village with the power of my scar and I'm holding him for ransom. After all," he added innocently, "you can't blame the boy. He's clearly not smart enough to find his way out here on his own

He’s pretty sure this will come as a surprise to absolutely no one who a) is sane, and b) has met him.
~ “The last time I tried to hug Angela,” Andy says, a note to his voice that makes Oscar really uncomfortable, a note that promises Bad Awkward Confessions to come, “she stepped on my foot. She said it was by accident, but it kinda seemed like it wasn’t. There was a definite … decisive … stomp-type motion. And she was wearing heels, and I wasn’t wearing shoes.”
~ “I hadn’t seen him in a while. And hey, if the Lord did not want me to make out with Carlos in a closet, He would not have put a closet in close proximity to a very boring Council meeting.”

The trick with Latin was finding a rhythm and sticking to it, then let the words just kind of flow out on their own. Okay, in this particular instance the words got a little mixed up with the words to Walk on By but it was a cursed disco ball for fuck's sake – it should appreciate the thematic convergence.
~ Sam turned and flashed him the ‘Would You Please Shut Up?’. Dean had names for all of Sam’s looks and pissy noises. It was quite a catalogue.
~
"Tully?" Sam asked. "You going somewhere?"
Tully looked surprised at the question. "With you, to find your brother."
"I wasn't…" Sam looked dismayed because of course he was, and then tried for strict. "I need you here to protect the ladies…" He looked to those ladies, the women of the Astoria, waiting patiently for this show of gentlemanly honour to play out, each holding a firearm, Lisabet holding two.
~
“How long does it take?"
"Don't know."
"How… What if I had forgotten everything? The way home. Would I have forgotten—"
Sam didn't let him finish that thought. "Don't know." Another pause.
"How do we get back?"
"It's in those books."
"How much time have we got?"
"I'm not sure."
"What's two plus two?'
"Bite me."
"So what do you know?"
~ "Dean, I promise you, I did nothing to him. He is a wicked, evil... monster. Twisted with hate and corrupted with power."
Dean tipped his head back, keeping his eyes on hers. "Sooo… what you're sayin' is… you want me to kill Darth Vader."
~ Francis had been known to hold a grudge. Actually, Francis had been known to hold a frat boy out a third floor window. By the ankle.
~ He didn't look like a woman -- he had way too much muscle for that. He didn't even look like a drag queen. He looked like Dean in a lime-green mini-dress and for reasons that were not entirely clear to her, Dean in a lime-green mini-dress looked like sex on a stick.
~
“And that it’s number one on my ‘Places in the country I’d rather take a vow of celibacy than see again’ list. There aren’t a lot of places on that list,” he adds, as if Sam couldn’t figure that out for himself. “Sorry,” Sam says sarcastically. “I must have missed that on our list of rest stop criteria. As far as I knew, it was only ‘motel with vacancy’ and ‘bed without suspicious stains’. I’ll be sure to add ‘entire population not out for Dean’s blood’ for next time.”
~ There’s very few things that could get Dean flustered, and Sam can figure this one out without twenty questions. “This has something to do with a woman.” “Dude, I resent that implication,” Dean says, managing to sound impressively righteous for someone crouching so awkwardly on the floor. “I can’t believe you think so little of me.” Sam doesn’t think his theory can be that insulting, given that it’s been proven right so many other times, but he rolls his eyes and mutters, “All right, sorry.” Dean’s injured look morphs into a smirk. “It involved several women.” “Oh my god,” Sam groans. “They’re going to come after us with pitchforks, aren’t they? Did you impregnate the cheerleading squad or something?”
~ “What the hell?” Sam demands, as Dean slithers over the seat and ducks back down into the passenger side. “You took forever,” Dean complains. “Anyone could have walked by and seen me in here!” “So you decided scaring the shit out of me was appropriate punishment?”
~ “What about the spare gas can in the trunk?” Dean suggests. “We used it up burning the bones of that marching band in Nebraska,” Sam says. “Remember? We had to throw in the instruments, too, and we needed a lot of fuel.” “Yeah, I remember. Those tubas were a bitch to carry,” Dean grumbles.
~ The pie isn’t even very good. Sam thought that was a law. Maybe even a commandment –every small town shalt serve excellent pie. It’s right there next to thou shalt always be welcoming and friendly, and thou shalt have a mom-and-pop general store. And hell, Sam has seen these rules broken before – their job often takes care of the former for them, and the economy is taking care of the latter – but in all the time he’s been hunting, the pie’s never been the aberration. He’s eaten three pieces anyway. The first was with great expectations, and the second was in hopes that the first was just a fluke. The third he eats just because there’s nothing else for him to do.
~ A steady stream of food keeps coming from the kitchen, all on the house because the owner, Carly, claims she owes her life to Dean. Sam’s not sure you could say Dean saved her life when the only risk to it was a rabbit, for god’s sake, but whatever. To hear the town tell it, from what Sam’s overheard, Dean saved all of them from certain doom, which, unless the rabbit had a nefarious plan involving nuclear annihilation, seems unlikely. He actually heard two people arguing about whether someone had to be dead in order to be canonized. It was terrifying.
~ Dean’s eyes go wide and he flaps his hands frantically at Sam in a way that could mean “get me out of here” or “I’m trying to turn into a bat.”
~ Sam spends a few minutes half-heartedly concocting a plan to get Dean out of Mapleville, but faking Dean’s death would take a fucking lot of work (and knowing their luck, the town would want to preserve the body for a museum exhibit or something equally creepy), and sending him via airmail to Wisconsin, while an entertaining thought, probably isn’t something the postal service allows. He even considers Dean’s two surefire answers for any problem (burning stuff and blowing shit up) but they don’t seem likely to help here.
~ “We’ve met,” Sam says. “By the way, he says hello. And he leered, but I’m not going to repeat that for you.”
~ “Your hatred of vegetables is baffling,” Sam says. “Dude, soybeans are not real food,” Dean argues. “They’re, like…used to make fake shit. And weird milk.” Sam’s contemplating the energy it would take to set Dean straight, and whether it’s even worth it.
~ “Dean, that’s so funny, I almost forgot that I can strangle you when you’re sleeping.”
~ “Ainsley is not my assistant and we work in different departments of the White House, so there would be no problems if we pursued a relationship that was more than strictly professional,” Sam responds. He realizes we’re staring at him. “Except for the fact that she’s a Republican and everything she believes is completely wrong.”
~
"I mean, damn, what'd you do, fall out of the sexy tree and hit every single branch on the way down!?"
~
Donna simultaneously kicks my ankle and elbows me in the ribs, with remarkable co-ordination. “Yes. I just reminded you.” 
~
“You’ve been practicing this speech, haven’t you?”
“Yes, so don’t interrupt me. You messed up.”
“You’ve already said that. Three times now.”
“That was an interruption.”
~ I give Sam a pointed look. “Sam, am I ever doing anything on a Friday night other than commiserating with you that I nothing to do on a Friday night?”
~
“St. Bart’s. Yet another place you’ve never taken me.” 
Josh sighs. “Are we going to play Places Josh Has Never Taken Donna?” 
“Why not? I’ll start at A.” 
“You did A at lunch the other week.” I had. Josh found my desire to go to Australia amusing, because he pointed out that all they have are poisonous animals and a coral reef that's dying anyway. “The B’s it is,” I declare. 
“I’ve taken you to Boston. Baltimore. Birmingham, Alabama during the campaign...Biloxi...Baton Rogue.” He screws up his nose. “Boulder, Colorado." 
“We drove through it. At two in the morning, on the way to Rapid City.” 
“Which is in the Black Hills,” Josh grins. 
~ I glare at him, before I realize that he’s looking for my zip. Laughing, I guide his hand to the side of my torso. “It’s a side zip, Josh.” 
“Women’s clothing needs a map,” he mutters darkly, sliding the zip down. 
~
“I wish I didn’t have to tell you that ghosts are real, but it’s kind of late for that, I think,” he replied.
“Well, if it’s a choice between ‘there’s an afterlife’ and ‘I’m clinically insane,’ I guess I don’t mind the first one being the winner.”
~ Sam has always known about Josh and Donna - they all have - in the same way you know when it's going to rain, or the way you can unconsciously hum the next note in a song you've never heard before, simply because it unfolds in your head.
~ “There’s a we. An us. You and me - a unit, a thing.”
“Yes, we’re a we. So and you and Sam, and you and CJ, and you and anybody else you refer to in conjunction to yourself. It’s called grammar, and if you’re having trouble understanding it, go and see Toby.”
~ Dean's pissed. He's pissed because not only has his psychotic new cellmate nicknamed him 'Pretty', but with T-Bag boasting about his new acquisition at every opportunity Dean's seriously worried that it might actually catch on. If he had to have a prison nickname, 'Pretty' would definitely not be the one he'd choose. Someone named 'Pretty' does not command respect. He pays Sam's cell a visit when the doors open for lunch to express exactly how unhappy about this he is. It is fairly obvious that Sam thinks this is the best thing that has happened since they got arrested.
~ Dean is staring at him like his eyebrows have been shaved off, which sounds exactly like something that would happen in prison to Sam, so he quickly raises a hand to make sure they're still there. They are.
~ Okay, Sam has definitely not been having sex with fish. He doesn't know who started that rumour, but it's just stupid. He's not even sure it's physically possible. "I – what? Fish?"
~
"The sheet?" Sam asks. He feels vaguely as if he's trapped in some bizarre dream. He hopes it started before they got arrested.
"The sheet!" Dean says, with a gesture that means absolutely nothing to Sam. "You – Sam, did he drug you?"
~ One of the guards comes by while Sam is diligently lining the cell with salt. This is never an easy thing to explain. It is especially difficult to explain, it turns out, to this particular guard, who is clearly put out by the fact that there are no specific rules against lining one's cell with salt and seems determined to find something about the situation that he can punish somebody for. When he starts talking about bringing in sniffer dogs to make absolutely certain that none of the 'salt' is cocaine, Sam wants to throw his hands up in the air and ask whether inmates often spread their drugs in full view across the floor, but instead he listens politely and nods and gets growled at for being insolent anyway.
~
"Bellick? He's probably just an asshole." "Maybe," Dean mutters. "But I like the explanation that means we get to kill him more."
~ "Why the hell'd you memorise summoning symbols, anyway?" Dean mutters. "It's not like we'd ever need to use them." Sam looks up at him and raises his eyebrows. "Not like we knew we'd ever need to use them. You know what I mean."
~ "I think I need to picture exactly what I want to happen," Sam says. "And I guess I should change the 'destroy my enemies' part of the incantation to 'slightly injure my friends'."
~ It was a gift from Crowley last Christmas, a doorbell that would chime according to the mood of the person entering. Unless it's Crowley entering, in which case it's silent—he always has been a sneaky kind of demon—or Aziraphale, in which case it sings Hallelujah in a deep baritone, which was rather charming the first time, mildly irritating the second, and now ensures that Aziraphale always enters through the back door. He's tried disconnecting it, but (and this might be Aziraphale's imagination) it appears to chime even louder when it's not connected up.
~ “My car is a robot,” Dean repeats, robot being the only word he’d heard, apparently. “Awesome.” His voice sounds hoarse.
~
Dean starts cussing. He walks in a circle saying every nasty word he can think of and ends up right back where he started, and he doesn’t look any happier. “Where’s my car?” he demands. 
~ After breakfast, they pull everything they own out of the car and sort it into Keep, Stash, and Toss, according to how likely it would be to land them in the electric chair.
~ Even on the road, where his preferred deodorant brand tended to be "whatever's cheapest that won't give me a rash" and his soap was "compliementary motel brand", he still insisted on buying the same shampoo.
~ “I'd need a flowchart to explain all the ways in which that was ridiculously insensitive.”
~
“You had my cable disconnected.”
“Well that's quite a leap. Just because I happen to have a 31 person maintenance department, each of whom you have personally abused at some point—”
~
“If I needed cheering up, I’d have put superglue on McGee’s keyboard.”
“You put superglue on my keyboard!” McGee yelled in the background.
~
“When she was thirteen she was already just in love with art, and she told me that she was going to fall madly in love someday with some talented artist who would not be recognized in his time (so she wouldn’t have to live in the spotlight) but who would go down in history as one of the greatest painters of the era. One day this man would come to her and insist that he paint her, that his portfolio could never be complete without her image. He would work tirelessly on this painting and when he was done he would tell her that it was his masterpiece and let her see it. And there would be a flawless image of herself (made more beautiful by his loving hand) and on her left hand he would have painted a diamond ring. ‘But I don’t have wear a ring like that,’ she would say, and he would reply ‘My masterpiece won’t be complete until you do,” and he would get down on one knee and ask her to marry him.” Lori’s eyes were glazed over as she remembered the day her daughter told her the fantasy. “It is one of my favourite memories of Pam. She was so innocent, so hopeful. I just thought it was one of the sweetest things I’ve ever heard.”
Jim beamed at her. “How the hell am I going to learn how to paint?”
~
“Okay,” Pam said, getting herself back under control, “focus. We need a gift for your niece. What does she like?”
“She’s three months old,” he said, “she likes sleep and her fist.”
~
“Owww,” Tony whines, jerking beneath Pepper’s fingers. “Are you enjoying my pain? Be honest.”
His assistant drops the shard of glass into the ashtray beside them, brushing her hair out of her fast with her wrist. “Yes,” she tells him flatly. “I’m hoping that you’ll die so that I will lose my job, my nice fat pay check, and the shoes I’ve been eyeing for the past three weeks.” He twists to pout mournfully at her, a gesture which she ignores with practiced ease.
~ “Merlin,” Arthur said in his stern ‘I-am-the-Prince’ voice, “Tell me who she is!”
~ Batman raised an eyebrow, and started to wonder why he hadn’t just made Clark deal with this strange man. After all, aliens should have to handle other aliens. It was just natural.  And it should be a rule.  He’d just decided.
~ Superman had just COMPLETELY locked him up like a little convict because he kept saying that you COULDN’T put Batman in the brig. You just couldn't do that. That was like shooting Batman. It was on the list of things you didn't do to Batman because he was Batman. Dick was like… ten and he knew that.
~ Oliver Queen looked up at Batman with a bruised eye and a split lip. He scowled and spit on the floor. Batman's arms clasped behind his back and he stopped pacing to look at his other prisoner. "Oliver can inform us of his scientific observations when his hearing has returned. Clark. Conclusions?"
Superman's face was expressionless. "I think this is a little… extreme."
Batman nodded. "The Kryptonite poisoning should wear off momentarily. Perhaps your head will be clearer by then, and you can explain to me the purpose of having microscopic and x-ray vision, if you're not going to use it.”
~ Sam opened the hardcover book he carried along everywhere and anywhere that required any type of wait. Dean assumed it was always a different book but he never took much notice of it other than its power to end conversation.
~ Keeping an eye on the silverware, Dean was glad to see none of it moving on its own accord.
~
“Dr. Sarah says? Who the hell is Dr. Sarah?” “She’s a celebrated psychoanalyst with her own syndicated column, radio hour and now an afternoon talk show,” Alec explained. “And she always says you should be part of the solution, not the problem.”
~ “I’m not fixing the dishwasher,” Alec informed him. “That thing never does anything but rinse everything in cold water. It‘s disgusting and wrong and you can’t make me be a part of it.”  “That’s not what I was-” “And the soap dispenser leaves streaks on the glasses.” If Dean had had any suspicions that Alec had jacked their washer just so he could do all the dishes by hand, they had just been neatly confirmed.
~
“Did you know," Alec clicked to an infomercial. "That the Carpet-Steamer-Master-Steam-Machine can clean almost all surfaces including crushed velvet?” “What the hell is crushed velvet?” “No one knows,” Alec waved a piece of liquorice at the laptop. “And what the hell would you be doing to it that you’d need a Carpet-Steamer-Master-Steam-Machine to get it tidy again?” Dean found himself actually trying to think of an answer for the question before he could stop himself.
~ Dean looped the television cord around his boot and very discreetly disconnected it from the wall. It was nice to watch Alec work the remote in puzzled confusion for a while. It got even better when he emptied out the batteries and attempted rotating them.
~ “Would you look at this,” Alec announced to no one at all. “And the guy just gave it to me. For free!” It had been a little anticlimactic lugging the giant crate from the bottom of the road and all the way up the porch steps with no audience. He’d had expected someone to be within shouting distance when he dropped it as noisily as possible right in front of the door. “Hello?” he tried again. “I did something awesome?”
~
“Increased-heart-rate,” Alec was having a harder time wheezing. “Drop-in-blood-pressure-uh … dizziness…possible loss of conscious…” “Is he fuckin’ around?” Dean asked. “’Cause the other day he pretended the car rolled over his foot and the little bastard almost gave me a goddamn heart attack.”
“Oh man,” Sam was next to him. “I think Alec is allergic to shellfish.”
“N-No-I’m-not,” Alec started shivering uncontrollably. “I’m normal! I love-bottom feeding crustaceans-soaked-in-melted-lard!”
“Yeah, well you love them so much that I think you might be going into anaphylactic shock.”
~
“Where are you and what have you done?” “Hedge maze at the end of the lawn. You’re gonna see a girl in a blue dress calling my name in a manner that one might call deranged. You’ll want to avoid her.”
~ "Oh look," the man calls happily behind him, "bystanders! Can we kill them?" "What the f—," Dean begins, alarmed. Sam sighs. It’s going to be one of those days.
~ They're running from a giant, nine-legged cross between a wildebeest and a tortoise. Fuck, Dean thinks. What is it with these people? It was a routine case. A routine case, he thinks again with some alarm as the thing behind him whips a tree from the ground and hurls it fifty feet. Sam is ahead of him and looking for all the world like a very determined marathon contestant, brow furrowed and long legs striding. ..And striding...Striding and leaving him behind, he notices. "Hey!" he shouts. "C'mon man, what the hell! You’re going to leave me with this thing?" Sam whips his head back and has the grace to look a little guilty.
~
Smoke is curling up softly from her left shoulder. She jogs over, and Dean appreciates her choice of shirt. The lack of one, mostly. Probably the fire's fault, but still.
~ “He dated her.”
Connor’s gaze snapped away from the stony glare on Dean’s face, eyes widened at Andrew’s revelation of information. “Dude!”
“Did I say that out loud?” Andrew asked innocently, continuing his work on the computer.
~ You’re not pregnant are you?” Dean asked with his eyes narrowed.
Holly’s eyes widened comically. She sputtered for a moment before finally shrieking: “Dad!”
“Valid question,” he responded, eyes turning on Andrew.
“Dude, I can’t get pregnant,” he said, holding his hands up in defence. 
~ “Yeah,” she said with a slight laugh. “Said if Superman could fly, so could he.”
“Did you explain the part that Uncle Clark is a fucking alien?”
~
She waved the hankie at him. “I wasn’t expecting you to have one of these, is all.” “A gentleman always has a handkerchief,” he stated loftily.  A wicked gleam filled her eyes. “Like I said…,” she began, darting away before he could grab her
~
"This is a spaceship," he said. "We just flew in a spaceship." "Oh, I like this one," the Doctor said. "Don't have to worry about him wandering off on his own. He'll be at it for another hour at least." "I'm in a spaceship."
~ “Yeah, just a few broken syllables, but…it wasn’t English. Wasn’t Latin either, or anything else I’ve ever heard. Do angels have their own language?” Sam just gave him an incredulous look, and Dean nodded. “Yeah, okay, how would you know that? How would anyone know that? It’s a good guess though, right?”
~
“Would you just get waffles or something?” Dean muttered, voice muted by the pile of blankets he was buried under. “And bring me pie.”
Sam turned. “Dude, you just puked after a glass of water; I am not—”
“Pie,” Dean repeated, lifting the blankets enough to glare at his brother.
~
Dean had a new favourite game. He called it Expanding Castiel’s Vocabulary. Sam called it Getting Us All Sent to the Bad Place.
“This isn’t corruption,” Dean said, sounding affronted. “It’s education. The world’s a mean, nasty place, and you gotta know how to give people the bird.” Dean Winchester’s philosophy of life, summed up in one pithy sentence.
Maybe begging would work. “Please, Dean, don’t,” Sam pleaded, putting as much sincere anxiety into his voice as possible. “We know God exists now, for real, and I’m pretty sure He wouldn’t approve.”
“Yeah, well, if I ever see Him, I’ll give Him the bird, too.” Sam felt his shoulders hunch up, and he involuntarily glanced toward the ceiling, waiting for lightning. 
~
“So, say I choke on a chicken bone tomorrow—”
“The life you lead, you really think you’ll die at the hands of a chicken carcass?”
“…So, I’m battling this huge fucking swamp demon with talons and shit—”
~ It was a good circle. It had elegant curves and strong lines. It had dizzying symbols done with ritual and meaning. It had etchings and worrying looking sigils. It had significant stones of power; it had bundles of important woods. It had rich altar cloths, glimmering metal implements. The book, which had a twenty-three syllable title meaning ‘instruction manual’ had highly graphic diagrams and gothic script so thick that it required an English to English translator. The robes of the three teens were the pitch black of the starless sky of Hell, covered with dark and brooding runes. It was a Ferrari of magic circles. If magic circles were a sellable commodity, this one would only appear to the Fortune 500 section of the catalogue. 
~ “His accent was hard to place. It was part British, part European, part American and mostly Royally Pissed Off.”
~ “Er…but we have summoned you, Master, so that you can receive your Chosen Vessel,” the girl continued, in the tone of voice when one finds unplanned for occurrences in a well rehearsed universe.
 ~ “Who the hell are they?” There were three of them, dressed in tattered strips of cloth. One was a curled up ball of limbs. He seemed to be muttering “I’ll be good. I’ll be good. I’ll be good.” Another was staring at a flower like it was the most fascinating thing in the whole world. He said nothing, but he smiled a lot in a fixed sort of way. And she was…well, skipping around, flipping an imaginary dirndl and humming tunes from The Sound of Music with apparent satisfaction and complete lack of inhibition. They made an interesting stage show. The bemused brothers watched for a while.
“Oookay…we’ve been mugged by three crazy people,” Sam summarised finally. “That’s definitely a first.”
~ Wrimos meet throughout the month to offer encouragement, commiseration, and—when the thing is done—the kind of raucous celebrations that tend to frighten animals and small children.
~ “Dude, they’re replaceable. I get the impression it hasn’t sunk in on you yet that You. Are. Not.”
~ “How’s the tabloid business?”
“Almost as good as the investor ass-kissing business,” Tobie replied smoothly. “You’re looking exceptionally well-preserved this evening, White. Did your wife change the formaldehyde in the vat you sleep in?”
~ After a moment, Perry said quietly, “I retract the ‘gun-toting gear-head cop’ comment. Not that it’s not true, mind you, it’s just that it’s no longer valid in context.”
Maggie Sawyer rolled her eyes at them all. “You all act like you’ve never seen a cop in a dress before.”
“I’d ask you to marry me, but you already did,” Tobie purred. “Damn, woman.”
~ Ellie and Captain Awesome had tactfully made plans to be out for the evening, Ellie beaming a little at Chuck as they went out the door, murmuring to Awesome about how cute Chuck and Sarah were together. (Tactful, they could do. Subtle, not so much).
~ "You took your pills?" "Funny you don't look a thing like my mother."
~
“Can I ask a follow-up question?”
“You’re about to leave through that window,” Casey replied, pointing threateningly.
“I rescind my follow-up question,” Chuck said quickly.
~
“I can’t believe we’re on a stakeout. For a dog.”
Sam snorted. “We’ve done weirder things.”
“True.” Dean shrugged. “And it is a possessed dog.”
~ “Maybe. Or maybe it’s a map to where he buried his secret stash of gold.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Right. We’ve been sleeping in the crappiest motels known to man for as long as I can remember because Dad had a secret stash of gold.”
“Secret stash of Oreos?”
“Yeah, Dean. Dad left us a message from the grave to find cookies.”
“It could happen.” Dean gave him a sidelong glance. “I’ve been hiding mine from you for years.”
“What?”
“You hit your growth spurt and you could eat your own weight in food. It was self-preservation. I could’ve starved to death.”
“And you’re still hiding food because…”
“It’s like having a stash of money in case you ever need it.”
“You have a stash of money?”
“No,” Dean said in that way that totally meant yes.
~ “Save it,” Dean said, looking back toward the house with a pained sort of smirk. “You’re a sucky liar. Tell me, don’t tell me, it’s fine. But if you don’t and it gets me killed, I will hurt you.”
~
"You said you wanted to talk." "I said... Dean. That was days ago." "Yeah, so? It takes me a little while to work up to it," Dean says, and now he's looking vaguely embarrassed and his shoulder is going higher.  "And I wanted to talk about the whole angels versus demons thing and how mad you are at me and... not what tree I want to be!" Sam can't help it, he's getting angry and he knows it's fuelled more by frustration than anything else but he's finding his moods and feelings these days harder to reign in than a cat on a leash.  "This was just my opening gambit. I have to work up to stuff like that," Dean says, now sounding put-out like Sam had just stomped all over his perfect plans which Sam supposes he has. "I was going to laugh at whatever sissy-ass tree you picked and then you would roll your eyes when I said that I'd be one of those ginormous oaks that could take down buildings with really persistent root systems and from there we'd get to... y'know." Dean swallows hard and winces like it hurts him to say, "Feelings."  "You're completely dysfunctional," Sam says in wonder but he can't help feeling a little touched. "Yeah, well, you're a douche," Dean rejoinders. "You can't say I didn't try." Sam narrows his eyes and watches Dean in silence for a while, watching the pink flush spread up Dean's neck and behind his ears. "You knew this would happen," Sam accuses. "Knew what would happen?" Dean says but it sounds so strangled that Sam just leans forward and pokes Dean hard in the joint between arm and pectoral. "Ow, Christ!" Dean flounders for a second because his natural instinct was to jerk away from Sam but he was driving so it didn't really work.  "You knew saying something so random would lead to us arguing about talking but not actually talking and you'd get out of it by being the hurt party!"
~ "I only wish to point out that I am very expensive," said the car. "At your current salary, and adjusting for the project cost of living, it would take working well beyond the typical age of retirement for you to afford to replace me."
~ "I am thwarting," Aziraphale said in the carefully reasoned tone of someone who has thought long and hard while under the influence of very good claret. "I'm thwarting like billy-o."
"Nobody," Crowley said, adjusting his sunglasses against the warm glow of a sunny late afternoon, "nobody says 'like billy-o.'"
~
Crowley glared at a puddle, and it obligingly evaporated out of his way. They walked in silence for about three minutes. Puddles that saw Crowley coming hastily rolled off the path.
~
At first, they had a rather strained, adversarial relationship, owing primarily to Aziraphale's charitable habit of giving a home to any and all books abandoned by their owner, or books that looked as though they might have been abandoned, or books that were about to become abandoned if the owner just turned his back for five minutes.
~
The next morning, Methos made large amounts of black coffee for them both, and they agreed never to mention the matter to anyone (that decision lasted eleven years), or to bid against that particular young man again (eleven weeks), or to bid against each other, for that matter (eleven days), or to do anything like what had occured during the previous night, ever again (eleven minutes, counting from when Methos set his coffee cup down and said, "I really should be going.").
~
"Years of living with Professor Slob here have toughened me up," Jim promised. 
"Have cured him of obsessive tidiness," Blair corrected, and started to tell Sam the tale of the Tupperware. 
~
"Shouldn't you be hungover?" Chuck asked plaintively. "I'm hungover."
~ “The Drama teacher’s a demon,” Dean says. “I swear to God. And I sit behind Barbie before her nose job. And? The kid next to me? Was wearing pink.” Sam rubs his stomach, thinking that maybe he has strained something. He frowns. “So. Lots of-” “He,” Dean interrupts, glaring at Sam. “He was wearing pink.”
~ Tony cleared his throat. “So, Luke’s your brother, hm?” Dean almost, almost, asked who the Hell Luke was, until he remembered that Luke was Sam’s name on the fake ID.
~ Brown Suit just smiled with palpable relief and said, “Oh, great, you’re are American. My friend and I seem to be a little bit lost.” “I’m not American,” Rodney corrected. “I’m not your friend,” said the other guy.
~ He was red. And blue. And... shining. And also five feet in the air. “Are you thinking in italics right now?” Rodney whispered.
~ John almost jumped. But it was just Batman, and wow, the guy could still sneak up on you when you already knew he was there. His reputation was so justified.
~
“What about Superman’s glasses?” Rodney countered. “They’d break.” “Not if they were made of adamantium.” Rodney gave him a look. “I know you know that’s Marvel.” He sighed. “Let’s just get back home.”
~ “He bought a book. Actually,” said Bernard.
“Er, Bernard,” said Fran. “That’s what we call a customer. Cus-tom-er. Not an angel.”
Oh, but it had been an angel. He was certain of that. It had touched him on the shoulder and said ‘Bernard’ and he had felt surrounded by love and mercy and joy. It had been like being hugged by the universe.
~
Clarkson broke his professional ‘talking to camera’ pose and turned to face him. “Look, if you don’t want to be here, then why are you?” May pointed to the other man. “Because that little toad has Fusker.” “He’s in a safe place.” Hammond said aside to the camera.  Clarkson turned to Hammond with dawning realisation on his face. “Hammond, when I said persuade him, I did not mean kidnap his cat, you tiny freak.” Then after an awkward pause “However, saying that it’s brilliant. Well done.”
~
“How could he be lost? All the roads in this wretched little town lead here.”
~
“…et sanctus how the hell did he do that?” “KEEP. READING.”
“Right, yes…dominum…”
~ “I can cut you out of my will, you know.” 
Batman’s scowl merely deepened as Robin, feared squire of the Dark Knight, giggled. “Totally worth it!”
~
Doctor Horrible turned around to find a tall, skinny man in brown pinstripes and a long coat standing in the doorway, looking Unimpressed (he felt the need to capitalise this in his head). He felt that this shouldn’t bother him, but the look in the stranger’s eyes seemed to say, “I need no Death Ray, I could kill you with my Brain” and he found this unsettling.
~
“Prototype,” he said, finishing whatever he was doing and holding it up. “I could get you one if you want—they won't be available to the public until spring of next year. Part of our new 'doesn't-kill-people-or-blow-stuff-up' product line.”
~
Sam scowled. “Don’t talk to strangers. Don’t leave with anyone but you. Stay in sight. And if someone tries to hit you with a pool cue, scream for all I’m worth.”
~ He was so shocked that for a moment, he was actually speechless. “Sweet?” he asked, the word tinged in something like horror.
~
“Dude. I did not have an imaginary friend!” Sam stated, the familiar argument coming to his lips quickly.
“So you say. So you say. But who’s the older brother here?” Dean asked.
“I did not—”
“I am.” Dean answered his own question, interrupting Sam with a big smile, “And therefore I know all.” He said with finality, then peered over Sam’s shoulder, “Is there a girl back there or what?”
~
The room was silent a moment when she left before Dean turned to Sam, a smirk on his face, “Dude, she’s way out of your league…” he stated, as he began to follow her.
Sam rolled his eyes, falling into step beside Dean, “Can you please attempt normal behavior?” he asked, sardonically, “She’s nervous. Be nice.”
The older man frowned, “You told me not to hit on her…”
Sam nodded, “Be nice.” 
Dean’s frown intensified, he blinked innocently at his brother, as they entered the kitchen, “But you told me not to hit on her.”
~ Sam grins. "You wanna race again?" "Fuck, no, do I look retarded?" "Yeah, a little bit." "If I could feel my feet or move my arms, I'd be throwing my shoe at you right now."
~ "Then lead on, MacBeth." "Lay on. And it's MacDuff." "What?" "It's ‘lay on, MacDuff'. I looked it up once."
“Seriously?” "And damned be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough'." "You'd tell me if you were possessed, right?"
~ Dean's torch clicks on and the light is like a slap in the face and then is gone; the darkness rushes back darker than before. "Batteries?"
"When is it ever the batteries? EMF's dead too. Stupid ghosts.”
~
It comes out quick, one panicked breath. "Theheadcheerleaderaskedmetotheprom." That's probably a word in German. Dean gets it, of course, the same way he got it when Sam had decided one day to make up his own language and spent hours conjugating verbs in a notebook he had to consult constantly for the next six weeks.
~ "Proms are, uh, usually a time when, uh," he falters again, and Sam's on the verge of whispering Christo when Dad brightens and says, "young men like to . . . rent hotel rooms."  What a euphemism. It's just spring in the air, this crazy urge to rent hotel rooms. Give me a break, Dad he wants to say, but Dad is clearly gearing up for a long talk, now that the ice has been broken. "See, sometimes, there can be pressure to engage in sexual intercourse, and I want to know that you're prepared . . ." Sam can feel his eyes bug out a little; is Dad giving him permission to . . . rent a hotel room?  Dean is making little choking noises, and Dad hands him a glass of water without breaking the flow of his talk.
~ "And how the hell was I supposed to know the guy would turn round and zap us into-" Dean had paused, unable to think up even a slightly sensible end for that sentence. He wanted to say "Ancient Rome", but he still held a vague hope this was all some illusion. 
~ "So, you know anything apart from exorcisms?" Dean had asked, after they'd wondered for a while, and it became clear that they weren't just going to snap back to real life any time soon.
"I picked up a little of the legal stuff," Sam replied. "You know, habeus corpus, caveat emptor, that sort of thing." 
"Great, so we can sue someone, then tell them to go to hell," Dean said, glumly. "We're gonna be popular around here." 
~ "Why'd you have to invite him?" "I told you I was going to!" "I just didn't think it would actually happen!" "Because I normally suck so hard at follow through?" "That's what I hear from Annie."
~ Sam's way too drunk to figure out two keys, and he shoves them at Nelson after a minute of fumbling. "You hold up the wall," Nelson says, and chuckles when Sam seemingly applies himself seriously to the job.
~
Dean slid his gun out of his waistband and took out the bullets for a quick cleaning. “How do we kill it?”
Sam smiled in the nervous way that Dean always took to mean, Yeah, about that…
Dean’s amused pre-hunt smile dropped. He glared a warning at Sam. “Sam, give me a way to kill the glowing smurf.”
~
They all looked to Sam. His mouth dropped open, but he hesitated and admitted, “Yeah, I have no idea.”
~ “He’s tied to a fucking chair, you morons,” Red growled. “It’s perfectly safe.”
~
“My name?” A slow blink. The kid was trying to process, which was a good sign. “Sam.” His eyes shut again. “Dean?” Multiple choice? Ron’s mouth tweaked despite the situation.
~ "Are we interrupting something?" she asked.
"Could you tell your neurotic, husband-to-be that I'm perfectly capable of doing my own fuckin laundry!"
Jess's eyes widened and her eyebrows shot to her hairline; she took a step back and bumped into Kerrie.
"Could you tell your obtuse, brother-in-law-to-be that it's a just a fuckin shirt!"
"Could you tell Mr. PMS that—"
"YEAH... okay..." Jess interrupted, "I'll take that as a resounding YES..." she finished, taking several quick steps back and pushing Kerrie backwards towards the door, "Let's go..." she whispered to the other girl.
"So that's what it looks like..." Kerrie stated looking over Jess's shoulder as the other girl maneuvered her back to the front door. She was looking back and forth between the brother's avidly, "It does look like there'll be bloodshed..."
"Shhhhh, let's just go..." Jess whispered, "It's safer..."
"But..."
"Go... before they pull us into it..."
"We're right here." Sam stated.
"We can hear you." Dean chirped.
~ Jess startled when he strode into the living room. "Where's my computer?" he asked.
She was wide-eyed and he realized he might have bellowed that.
~ "Is it one of those emo-women days that you were supposed to remember?"
Ah, her brother-in-law and his way with words. She smiled at how disgusted he sounded.
"I don't think so . . ."
Her smile grew as she could practically hear Sam running through a list of emo-women days in his head.
"First time you met?" Dean asked, apparently trying to help Sam get through the list.
"September."
"First Date?"
"October."
"First kiss."
There was a pause, then, "September."
Now, she could practically feel Dean arch an eyebrow. "First time you had se--"
"DEAN!"
A chuckle.
Jess rolled her eyes.
"I'm just askin’ . . ."
"Well, don't – and no," Sam responded.
There was another pause, then, "Birthday?"
"April."
"Some Hallmark holiday?"
"Dude, Valentine's Day is in February."
"I know that! I'm not an idiot! I'm just thinkin’ maybe there's another one or something! Maybe when you remember you first met is not when SHE remembers you first met," Dean encouraged.
"We were in the same class. We had a project -"
"IT'S NOT AN ANNIVERSARY!" Jess yelled from the living room, rolling her eyes.
~ "Jess, what's wrong?" Sam asked, giving her his worried look.
And she almost caved right then, because he looked so sorry . . .
But success of her plan depended on this so she narrowed her eyes instead. "You should know," she snapped.
That always worked.
Sam glanced at Dean quickly and Dean sent him a swift look back. A swift look that looked sort of – reassuring.
Then he was looking at her and Jess found herself looking back. Her glare faltered a bit at the intensity of that gaze – she almost felt like he could see right through her.
Dean offered her a small smile. "Oh, come on, Jessy . . ." he murmured. "Give us a hint and we'll fix it."
She looked to Sam and he was looking at her so earnestly and again – she almost caved.
Instead she made herself scowl. "You can't fix it."
In the bat of an eyelash Dean's look became serious somehow. "If you tell me what's wrong, I'll fix it."
This time when Jess looked to Sam he was nodding earnestly, almost vigorously, and Dean was looking at her with that almost startling seriousness, his gaze as steady as his words.
She couldn't help it.
A smile broke across her face. That's what they'd been like, she thought suddenly, and was sure of it. Dean prepared to fix anything that was wrong and Sam utterly confident that Dean could; and it was just . . . so . . . adorable.
How was she supposed to be pissed with that?
~ Jess scowled – for real this time. "You were looking forward to it!" she accused.
"Yeah, like a root canal…A mud wrap! You said they were gonna wrap us in MUD and I couldn't even be in the room when they wrap you in mud, because its guys go one place and girls go another . . ."
~ "You told her I'm a bounty hunter," Dean cut him off.
"Yeah." Sam took a deep breath and confessed the rest. "Freelance."
"Freelance."
"You know, when you're not actually employed by an office, but you get paid by the people that hire—"
"I know what freelance is, Sam."
~ "Sam, relax," Jess comforted. "What's the worst that could happen?" she murmured.
His eyes widened. "You did not just say that! Oh, God – do you realize that's like . . . like . . . tempting all the -"
~ Jess rolled her eyes, "He doesn't kill people, Jill. Jeez. I told you -"
"Isn't the slogan Dead or Alive?" her little sister asked, interrupting Jess. "I've seen TV. Bounty hunters get their money if the quarry is dead or alive as long as they bring it in . . . and his penchant for leather already tells us he likes to kill things."
Dean blinked at her, then shifted to look at Sam. "Seriously? Did she seriously just say quarry?"
~
"Do you have a concussion? How many walls did you get thrown into?"
~
“So,” Sam said slowly, “you guys think I’m on drugs because I’m happy and helped with dinner.” “Dude, I think you’re just nuts.” Dean shrugged. “Dad thinks you’re taking uppers because you went from Emo McTeenageangst for a month and a half to suddenly being Happy McFamilyman over night. I told Dad you probably finally got laid.”
~ They all sit down and Dean rubs his hands together, then looks at his plate. "This looks, um...interesting." "It's braised salmon with leeks," Sam says. Dean nods, looking unconvinced that it's edible. "Does he not like salmon?" Jess asks in a whisper. "He likes salmon," Sam tells her. "He's sitting right here," says Dean.
~ "I do work at Starbucks," Sam says. Dean sighs and closes his eyes, shaking his head like Sam's just broken his heart. "Oh, fuck you," says Sam, though he sounds amused, not angry. "Heath insurance is a good thing." 'I've got health insurance." "No, Paul Henderson has health insurance, you've just got an ID that says you're Paul Henderson." "Abe Kusznierewicz, actually," Dean says with a grin.
~ Jess pulls the remote closer to her body. "My TV, my remote." Dean laughs and looks at Sam. "Is she serious?" "I dare you to find out," Sam says, not looking up from his textbook.
She drops the remote down the front of her shirt. "My TV, my remote." "Don't think I won't go after that," Dean says. "I'll stab you in the throat," Sam says, still not looking up. "Only after I castrate him with a garlic press and feed his balls to the Doberman next door," Jess says sweetly. Sam smirks. Dean looks slightly terrified. "Your girlfriend's violent," Dean says. Sam flips a page in his textbook. "Only when provoked."
~ "Don't tell—," Dean says at the same time Jess yells, "Sam!" She runs down the hall and Sam's already running in from the bedroom, pushing past her to get to Dean in the bathroom.
~ Dean laughs and rubs his hand over his stubble. "Embarrassing, huh? He ever mention the time he tried out for the gymnastics squad?" "It was the cheerleading team, and if you tell that story I'll make you sleep in your car," Sam says from behind him.
~ "Dude. Stop staring at her ass," says Sam. "Have you seen her ass?" "Yes, actually." "Then you know why I'm staring at it." Jess grins and pretends she can't hear them, though they're only a few steps behind her. "She doesn't happen to have any naughty schoolgirl outfits, does she?" Dean asks. Jess looks over at her shoulder at him and grins. "Dude," says Dean, looking at Sam. "You're, like, the luckiest man alive."
~ Sam pauses and looks at Dean with incredulity. "A chupacabra?" he asks, and Jess thinks for a moment that Sam thinks Dean's crazy, just like she does. Then Sam says, "Christ, Dean, chupacabras feed on animals, not humans, and they definitely don't tie humans up and feed on them for days before finally killing them." "I know," says Dean, raking his fingers through his hair. "I know, OK? It's not a chupacabra chupacabra, it's just...it's a bloodsucky kind of humanoid kind of mothman-ish thing, but no wings." Sam rolls his eyes. "It looked like a dog at first, if that helps," Dean says. He hurries into the hall and looks both ways before darting off towards the living room. "Great," Sam grumbles. "A shape shifter."
~ “Dean Michael Winchester, you are not going to burn the Eldridge Hotel to the ground.”
“I didn’t say I was going to!”
“But you were thinking it.  What’s wrong with you, boy?”
“Dude, my brain is so totally off limits.”
“What brain?” Sam muttered just loud enough for Dean to hear.  Dean lunged at his brother, but at the last moment he realized his path was blocked by a tiny child.  He rocked to a stop, desperately trying to catch his balance before he pitched forward on top of a little girl who looked no older than two or three.  She stared up at Dean with huge brown eyes, her thick hair sectioned out into braids by pink and red marble hair ties.  She lifted her arms, grasping at air with chubby fingers.  Dean blinked at her, completely mystified.
~
"Fertility rite, dude. Guy and a girl last year, both burned up. Sacrifices to, I dunno, the Pagan Lord of the Dance." "There is no Pagan Lord of the Dance, Dean." Dean grabs Sam's laptop. "Yeah? Let's see what Google has to say about that."
~
Sam looked at Dean, obvious confusion growing across his face.
Dean exhaled. “I’m Whipper, you’re Snapper. Just go with it.” He pulled one shoulder up and rolled his eyes.
~
 Morgan, the short, bearded amateur porn director, stood stock still in one of the aisles, his eyes wide and his hand shaking as he pointed at Lester, mouth working to produce incomprehensible, high pitched sounds of denial, and a fluffy haired, creepy looking older man in a white shirt and black tie was running back and forth crying "PINEAPPLE! PINEAPPLE!" at the tops of his lungs.
~
“Cotton? No, I think they’re more of a wool, fire-ant blend.”
~  “Does that mean his life’s worthless?” “No. It means it’s worth less than yours.”
~ “Hello, Weevil Man,” Martha says brightly.  “I’m not going to talk to you if you’re going to be infuriating,” Owen informs her. “I have other friends; I don’t have to put up with the teasing.”
~ “Like I said before, we don’t give free rentals based on bad movies…or bad taste. You rented Ninja Cheerleaders. This would be like me going to a restaurant, ordering a rat on a stick, eating it, and then asking to get the meal free.”
~ “You’ve got great legs,” Dean said, apropos of nothing. He was sitting in the chair behind her, shucking corn. She blushed like a schoolgirl. Oh, for fuck’s sake. Slice the bell peppers, woman. Slice the bell peppers.
~ Crowley was distracted from his revenge upon the sweater vest by the gesture. Damn, but did he look cool like that. He resolved to learn how to raise an eyebrow scathingly as soon as he managed to get his own body back.
~ She gestured in a sort of inarticulate female rage at the obtuseness of boys, and Adam realised she was holding an axe in her other hand. He took a step back.
~ S: “I’m a molecular biologist. I don’t care about things I can see with my eyes.”
~ am glanced at his own now-uncuffed wrists, then back at the straitjacket that the CIA agents were apparently going to leave on his brother for the duration, and felt an irrational, hot indignance rise up in his chest as he realized what that implied about their relative threat levels in the eyes of the government.
~ Chuck kind of wondered where one actually got a straitjacket on such short notice.
~ “Please tell me my gift is something totally illegal to mail. Something that shoots or explodes.” 
Sam shook his head, looking particularly pleased with himself. “Can’t tell you. It’ll ruin the surprise.”
Dean barked out a laugh as they crossed the road toward their motel. “Ha! That means yes!”
~ It’s sparsely furnished, but she’s provided them with scandalous amounts of pillows.
~ It’s weird, sharing a bathroom with a woman. Sam at least has some practice at it, but Dean can’t get over the fact that all available shelf space is occupied by an army of smelly bottles. “Who needs this much shit?” he says in affronted awe. “Leave her stuff alone,” Sam says, muffled by the toothbrush in his mouth. “But what does it all do?” Dean fiddles with a pair of eyelash curlers, squeezing them in Sam’s face, until he gets distracted by the bra air-drying over the curtain rod. Delicately, he reaches out and inspects the tag. “Heh. Called it.” And the worst part is, Dean looks genuinely proud of his mad rack-reckoning skills.
~ “Dean,” Sam snaps. “She’s not a hired babysitter.” Note to Sam: quit giving Dean ideas. “He gets cranky when we can’t find his noo-noo,” Dean tells Maria with an apologetic shrug. “If he gives you any trouble, you got my permission to smack the smartass out of him.” Maria nods, deadpan. “When’s bedtime?” “Ten sharp.”
“I’ll sing a lullaby.” “You both suck,” Sam grumps, “And I’m putting rubber cement in your toothpaste.”
~ They watch a sunset that looks like it belongs in a modern art museum, snorting when Maria whines that, “The sky’s too big. ‘S like it’s trying to eat me.” “You dork,” Dean says. Sam lets out a noise distressingly like a giggle. He gulps Bourbon so he doesn’t have to see the look on Dean’s face.
~ “That right there,” Bobby noted dryly, “is the sign of a man incredibly secure in his marriage.” Sam rolled his eyes and said, “A gun? You bought your wife a gun for your anniversary?” Dean shrugged. “I wrapped it in pink.”
~
Maria smiled tiredly and said, “Will you be her godfather?” Given the way Dean beamed at Maria like she’d just come up with the best idea in the history of child-rearing, Sam figured he’d better say yes.
~ “Dean,” Sam says, and man, this one only gets better with repetition: “you are a soccer mom.” Dean pokes a bruise in indignation. “It’s softball, bitch.”
~ For a few seconds, each sees his own cluelessness mirrored in the other’s cluelessness. It’s like a funhouse mirror of stupid. “What are you talking about?” Sam says slowly. “What were you talking about?” Dean says suspiciously. “I was talking about a case. You were the one getting all…” Sam twirls his finger demonstratively. It’s not a gesture Dean appreciates.
~ “So new rule: you take a buttload of Claritin before you get anywhere near the big bunches of evil.” “A buttload,” Sam echoes. He’s using his aren’t-you-someone’s-dad? voice. “Really.” Nod. “Must be some strange, European metric unit.”
~ “It was a dumb risk, is what it was,” Dean snaps. “And we definitely taught him better.” Sam raises his eyebrows, deeply skeptical of the notion that Dean Winchester has ever imparted a sense of self-preservation to anyone.

“What are you going to do, take his guns away?” “Damn straight I will.” And somehow Dean is on his feet, chin high like he’s bracing for a fight. That’s about when Sam starts laughing at him. Dean’s righteous anger collapses into a bitchface. “You’re a real jackass, you know that?” “You—“ And crap, it’s an actual giggle fit, the kind Sam claims he grew out of when he was a teenager. “You old fart.” He puts on a creaky old man voice: “When I was his age…” And then he dissolves into laughter again. “Fuck you, Sam.” But Dean’s smiling a little bit too. “And we—we had to walk seven miles from the motel to the graveyard every night,” Sam says, practically choking on his own comedic genius. “Uphill both ways.”
~ Sam was pretty sure it took a special kind of talent to be able to wear a straitjacket casually.
~ “Uhm . . . well . . . let me think. Oh, right. Homer, Evy? You want to name our son Homer?”
“Have you ever read ‘The Illiad’?”
“Yes, Evy. And it was boring.”

Jimmy grinned up at her from the wheelchair. "I could get used to this," he said. "Getting pushed around by beautiful women."
"From what I hear, that's pretty much your dating history," Lois said dryly.

“So. The Daily Bugle's headline tomorrow: Spider-Man Goes Apeshit!” Daredevil gave him a crooked smile. “What do you think?” Peter snickered. “More like, 'As J. Jonah Jameson Predicted, Masked Menace Spider-Man Goes Apeshit, Makes Mayhem With Buddy Daredevil. Those Bastards.'”
~ He frowned as he stepped out, and thought about saying something, but then stopped short when a blonde girl in front sort of hopped with excitement. "It's him, you guys!" she hissed. Instant silence. Six pairs of very wide eyes fixed on Peter. He tried to force a smile through the 'what the hell?' expression he felt going across his face. "Uh. Hi?"
~ "Right," Matt agreed. "One of those, 'justice is blind, and so's this lawyer' things." "Thought you hated those." Foggy sounded surprised. "No offense, kid." Peter winced. "I'm persuasive?" "Oh, you're buying lunch." Foggy chuckled. "I get it."
~ "Oh, rats! I forgot to tell you. I think your secretary might think you're gay and into bondage, and it's kind of my fault. So, um, sorry about that."
~
"Let me see if I understand this," se said after John finished outlining his plan. "We are to sneak into Dr. Beckett's office, steal the tape, and leave." "Yeah, that's the plan." "That's the entire plan?" Ronon asked. John spread his hands wide. "What's wrong with that plan?" "It's a stupid plan," Rodney intoned.  "No, see, it's brilliant in its simplicity." John looked at his team. "What?"
~ “I told you,” she hissed, “I am trying to help you!”
“Yeah?” Roy snorted. “Do me a favor, then? Switch sides! We’ll do better that way.”
~
“When I find this guy, I’m going to beat him so hard that anyone who even looks like him is going to bleed.”
~ Inside the house there's a thump and Dean cursing words Bobby wasn't sure a ten year old should know, some even he didn't know.
~ Jewelry is what you give a girl when you give up. Like, "Fine, I admit it. I don't pay attention to your hobbies, your favorite TV shows, movies, or music, what kind of books you might like, how you dress, what you like to eat, what you do in your spare time, where you might like to go on vacation, what your house looks like on the inside, or anything about you in general other than that you're a woman. So here, have a diamond.

“Are you making fun of us?” the thug thundered.
“It is the universe that makes fun of us all,’ he replied, calmly.
“Why exactly would the universe make fun of us all?” She later asked.
“Maybe it’s insecure.”
~
“Is it?”
“That’s very zen.”
“Is it?”
“Say ‘is it’ again and I’ll shoot you.”
~
“Yes, Alex, I’ll take horror movies that take place on ships for 700.” The lights go out. “Oh goody, double jeopardy.”
~
“I mean, you were a little girl once…”
“There’s no proof of that.”
~
“It was a near-death experience. It not being a full-death experience should make you happy.”
~
“Seriously, what’s with all the singing? You seem happy.”
“I’m spending my gold already.”
“I suggest singing lessons.”
~
“You said it yourself: if there’s gold on this island, they’ll kill you. If there’s no gold, they’ll kill you slowly.”
~
Dean interrupted him with gritted teeth, “Sam. If you continue to talk I’ll be forced to pull this car over and end you. Do you understand? No more talking about my lips.” His little brother was the image of innocence, “Sure thing.”
~ “You’re not gonna puke or something, right? Because I’m not prone to randomly puking and I’d hate to think my genetic donor is a pussy.”  That snapped Dean out of his shock, “Your genetic donor may be prone to kicking your ass if you keep it up.”
~ Dean met Sam’s eyes in the rearview mirror and made a slashing motion over his throat with his finger. Sam proudly held up his middle finger in response. “Boys.” John didn’t even open his eyes.
~ "You're the one who asked me to introduce you to the people I work with!" Fitz said, stopping in the middle of the sidewalk. "Remember? You wanted to ask Monica out on a date. She's still not talking to me, by the way. Thanks a lot for that." Shaking his head, Tony walked over and grabbed Fitz's arm. "How was I supposed to know that I'd dated her sister a few months earlier?" he asked, forcefully pulling Fitz along with him. "They're identical twins!"
~ Tony have him a half-hearted wave as he adjusted the duffel bag on his shoulder. "You know how I was staying with the boss while my place was being fumigated?" he asked, sounding almost sheepish. Despite his better judgment, Fitz nodded. "He threatened to shoot me if I didn't find somewhere else to stay."
~ Sam startled when the Impala hit the rumble strip, rushing upward and blinking hard. “Wha’z that? Di’ we kill a lion?”
“I promise you, not a lion. You ever heard of lions in Nebraska?”
Sam turned sideways in his seat to regard him seriously, his eyes wide and earnest and still partly asleep. “Anything could happen, Dean. It could have been a ghost lion.”
“Well, then, it would already be dead, wouldn’t it? Go back to sleep, dude.”
~ They tumbled inside, and then Dean halted just past the entryway, unsure of where to go, while Sam started vibrating around the room, looking for something to do, picking things up and putting them down, as if one of the demonology books stacked on the side table might have a cure for every childhood illness. Bobby could see that he was going to have to be the sane one in this situation. As usual.
~
Dean is giving Sam his innocent face that usually means he’s guilty as hell.
~
The official statement on what happened was about as vague and ass-covering as possible, saying it was caused by an "unknown compelling force." In laymen's terms this means, "fuck if we know."

Seriously, it’s like the man just didn’t understand the concept of special effects and so was wholly unaware that human beings are not supposed to be able to actually do these things.

In this particular exhibit, an adult lion is trained to climb onto a waiting horse, which then jogs about the ring while the bravest, cruelest, or perhaps the most dangerously suicidal man in all of China provides incentive by cracking his whip at them.

Yes, in a world where there are still children with no address other than "whichever bridge Bob the Rapist isn't sleeping under tonight," PETA decides the best use for a building specifically designed to house large numbers of people is to campaign for the imaginary rights of animals with nervous systems so primitive they can survive for several minutes after being cut in half.
~ Hmmm... you know, we may have spotted the flaw in the cunning plan of posting on Livejournal about a boycott on Livejournal posting. And in true internet fashion, fully half of the strike posts were calling the strikers fags, another quarter were "I support them but won't do it myself," and we're sure at least four entries were slash porn on the subject.
~ “In my defense,” he began guardedly, “It wasn’t supposed to explode. I didn’t even know liquid could combust like that.”
His wife leveled him with a steady glare. “It can’t,” she told him flatly. “Which says everything about your—no. I will not call this … this travesty … cooking. It’s an insult to the art.” 
~ “Are you saying that my person somehow resembles a mattress? Do I look like sheets and I duvet to you, Theodore?”
“You do not in any way resemble a mattress,” he said quickly, before she could continue. “You are, by at least a million years, the most beautiful girl in the room.”
They were alone in the kitchen. Andromeda’s eye twitched, but so did the corner of her mouth.
“And, if I may say so, you looked absolutely delectable in that batter. In fact, if it weren’t for our sleeping daughter in the next room, I might propose that breakfast not go entirely to waste. I mean, who needs plates when you’ve got as enchanting a wife as mine?”
~ “He called me an idjit,” Coyote says softly.
“Yeah?” Dean’s wary. “I was standing right here when he did it. So?”
“That’s the nicest thing he’s ever said to me.” Coyote sounds like he’s going to start bawling.
John rolls his eyes. “Wait until he threatens to shoot you in the ass with rock salt. You’ll really feel like you belong then.”
~ Once upon a time, on a night Murphy had had very little sleep, she met a troll under a bridge and a man who had killed it with a very large cleaver. She had two conflicting explanations about that night. The first was that she had been very tired and stressed and that she had somehow hallucinated the whole thing. The second was 'yep, that was definitely a troll'.
~
“Can we make it eight-thirty? I have to see a man about a unicorn,” he said, in the same half-serious, half-joking tone.
“That’s fine,” she said. “Thank you, Mr. Dresden.”
“Don’t thank me yet,” he cautioned. “I may be useless. It’s been known to happen, on occasion. Mostly on days ending in Y. Plus there is a good chance I will be gored by a unicorn and never show up at all.”
~
“Enclosed space, handcuffs. You know I had a dream like this once. Involvement was less involuntary, though. Still we could make the best -” There was a buzzing sound and his and the Doctor’s free hands were pulled to the wall like magnets and stuck there by the nodes on them. “Alright, that could impede my plans slightly. I shouldn’t have said anything.”
~ “Oh, the closing number,” Jack agreed. “It’s like they measured to see how long you could stand to sit there before your head exploded and then threw in the best closing number in history right at the last second.”

Braveheart was their new favorite movie. They were still bellowing “They’ll never take OUR FREEDOM!” at each other at random intervals.
~ “Right,” he said. “I don’t want to know. But in case you were having a pranker’s block, I should tell you that Malfoy is majorly scared of mice.”
~ “Yes, thank you Malfoy. Your opinion is priceless and has been duly noted,” he said blandly.
~ Ronon has a healthy respect for anyone who carries that many knives, understands the concept of honour and can swear in six different languages that they recognised and several that they didn't.
~ "I was X-raying that dumb chest to find out what was inside, and pouf, he shows up like a genie out of a bottle. You're telling me that's trustworthy? People popping out of thin air?"
~ He nods again, looks wary. Sam gets the impression that wary is Dean Winchester's default setting.
~ “Well, you can always try clicking your heels three times,” Ianto suggested dryly. “It’s the tried and approved method.”
Avon gave him a withering look. “I’m sure, given the correct cultural background, I would find that comment both witty and erudite but, as you can plainly see, I fail to garner any amusement from it.”
~ “I’m pretty sure the good guys try not to threaten kids. It’s kind of a requirement for being a good guy, actually. I mean, the Auror handbook has an entire chapter devoted to how you don’t threaten children. In extra big print. With liberal application of both capslock and italics.”
~
“But how did it go?” Al demanded. “Aside from the whole not being maimed or tortured thing, I mean.” He and Scorpius had commandeered a corner not long after James left, and had spent the interval plotting together in low voices. Harry couldn’t quite make out what they were plotting, and he knew if he asked they'd give him identical wounded, wobbly-lipped looks of betrayal, probably accompanied by one of Al's many rants about the evils of such blatant anti-Slytherin prejudice in Magical Law Enforcement.
But Harry was nearly forty, after all, and wise to the ways of both his children and the Wizarding World. Two Slytherins talking quietly in a corner equaled one thing: plots, evil plans, world domination, the whole shebang. Or, you know, budding romance, but the boys were still a little young for that.
~
Oh, for Merlin's sake... “Look,” Harry snapped, exasperated, “tell your father to just let it go, all right? For the last bloody time, I didn't make the guy cry. It was the onion’s fault, all right? The onion’s, not mine. My kidnapper had very sensitive eyes.” Harry had felt rather sorry for the sobbing man, actually, and had led him gently to a sink and helped him rinse out his eyes, before clubbing him over the head with a frying pan, tying him up, and tossing him to the Ministry through the Floo.
He’d have escorted the kidnapper himself, of course, if the turkey hadn’t needed watching. Plus, hearing about Shacklebolt going quietly apoplectic whenever Harry did things in his own special rulebook-what-rulebook-since-when-do-Aurors-have-a-rulebook-la-la-la-I-can’t-hear-you way was practically, well, life-affirming.
“In all fairness,” said Teddy the Terminal Hufflepuff, “the onion didn’t exactly mash itself into his face, rub itself into his eyes, and stuff itself up his nostrils.”
“Yeah, well,” Harry muttered. “Teach the bastard to try and kidnap a man from his own damn kitchen the day before his wife’s birthday.”
“‘Eat Onion Death, Arse-Face’,” Al, Teddy, and James quoted together
~ Later, Severus had to acknowledge that keeping the intruders in the shop had been, well, unforgivably and inarguably stupid.
“Short-sighted,” Albus corrected gently, but everyone knew that was Dumbledore-speak for “completely brainless”.
~ “At least we have each other,” Al said, absolutely serious.
“Yeah,” James agreed. “Al’s little, we can use him to bludgeon anyone who comes in the door.”
Harry gave this due consideration, while Al yelped and kicked his brother in the ankle.
~ "Pressure bandage," John said. "Stop the bleeding. Stabilise. Fluids. Wait for--" He stopped abruptly, as if he had caught himself on the verge of saying something that he shouldn't have said.
"Or call for an ambulance, like ordinary people do," Dave said, his voice harsher than he had intended it.
~ "They'll have told you the truth. You didn't believe me when I told you, but--"
"It's kind of hard to argue with a space ship." Dave smiled. 
~ But even though the heist was a spectacular failure, there's an odd sense of accomplishment growing in his stomach that he really hopes isn't his lungs filling slowly with blood.
~ Chuck leaped. Sam dropped to the ground. Sarah raised her gun again. The soft *ptew!* of a silenced shot puffed through the courtyard. Chuck wondered why the hell the rest of his neighbors didn't think he was in some sort of gang or something by now. Or maybe they did. Mrs. Pendleton had been being strangely nice to him, of late. . . .
~ "Holy crap, you're an angel!" He slapped his hand over his mouth. "Holy crap, I said 'holy crap' to an angel. Holy -- I'm shutting up now!"
~ One of them smiled, head tilting to one side in that way that seemed to be demon-speak for you are so completely fucked.
~ Merlin sank to his knees with a surprised look on his face, and then toppled over unconscious. Right, excellent plan. 
~ Arthur eyed the hovering torch a little anxiously—he was fairly sure his father wasn't going to burn him alive, but the thing was just a bit close for comfort. "Then the only point is for me to be worth saving," Arthur said, and tried hard not to think about what it was going to feel like to be burned alive in full armor.
~ Merlin didn't say anything for a moment, and when Arthur turned back to glance at him, there was a strange look on his face—something fey and far-away. Oddly, for all the fire and lightnings, that was the first time it really hit Arthur that Merlin was a wizard, part of some strange and distant world. It was a lonely thought, and Arthur almost wanted to stop him, to put a hand over his mouth, as Merlin turned to him and said, "You will be king in Camelot, my lord," in a voice full of thunder. Then he shook himself all over and stared at Arthur wide-eyed, still the complete idiot who fell over his own feet more often than not and couldn't boil an egg to save his life. "Er," Merlin said. 
"Right, no more prophecies," Arthur said. "That's just creepy."
~ "I think Taliesin may already be writing a song about us," says Merlin in the tones of one giving unavoidable news of a fatal illness. "Well, mostly about you."
~
“Bless your heart" is southern code for "Oh, honey. You're a moron."
~ "I said to you, "if you're not careful, you're going to fall". What did you think I meant?"
"I thought you meant off the cloud. And I thought, "that's a stupid thing to say, because I've got wings so what does it matter?" Crawly extended his wings as though to demonstrate, spreading them wide.

“A half-eaten bag of Spicy Ranchero Doritos is not a Christmas present.”

“Well, I didn’t finish it. Everybody knows the last few ounces of a bottle of pop are statistically seventy percent backwash, Dean.”

Sam kicked Latin ass.  Hell, when he was fourteen years old he extemporaneously cobbled together an exorcism in Latin, a benediction in Aramaic, and an injunction in Ancient Greek while under fire from a trio of poltergeists.  And now, riding the high from an exam he knew he had aced, he could finally acknowledge that he was, indeed, The Man.
~ “I’m not Dean,” said the driver of the SUV.  She leaned over and shook his shoulder.  “Quit calling me Dean.”
“Sorry,” Sam said.  He tried to focus on breathing again.  It was the fever, he thought, it was raising his heart rate, making it hard to breathe, making it hard to keep up. “I just got a little confused there.  Dean’s usually driving.  Who are you, again?”
“I’m Jess,” she said, smiling a little from the corner of her mouth.  Sam liked her already.  Whoever she was, she was displaying remarkable equilibrium for someone transporting a delirious stranger to the ER.  And she hadn’t changed out of that wonderful, wonderful skirt.
“Hi, Jess.  I’m Sam.”
“Hi, Sam.”  She laughed.  “This is the third time we’ve been introduced in as many minutes.”
“No kidding?  I can’t believe I’d forget you.  Ignoti nulla cupido.  No, wait, that one doesn’t work.”
“Must be some trip you’re on.”
“I’m not…I’m sober,” he said.  “Call Dean, he’ll tell you.”
“Yeah, I’ll get right on that.”
“That is a glorious skirt.”
“Seriously, Sam, what did you take?  They’re going to ask you when we get there.”
“Didn’t take anything,” he mumbled and coughed shallowly.  “Swear to God, Dean.  I didn’t take anything.”
“And here we go again.  I’m Jess.”
“Hi, Jess.  I’m Sam.”
“Hi, Sam.  What are you on?”
“Nothing.  Jurare in verba magistri.  Hey, I really like your skirt.”
“Oh, for crying out loud.”
~
“Yes, sir. Harry James Potter –” he resisted the urge to say ‘Trouble’ instead of ‘James’, because this definitely wasn’t the right time for sarcasm.
~ “I’m afraid the Minister is very busy and isn’t seeing anyone without an appoint --” She looked up, trailed off as she saw who was asking, and practically bounced in her chair. “Oo! Harry Potter!”
~ "A hundred things to do before I die," Crowley said patiently. "Well, more before everybody dies, really. Here, have a chocolate. They were handing them out earlier to stop people rioting."
"Did it work?" Aziraphale asked absently, reaching for one.
"Well, no-one got lynched, so possibly they can count it as a success," Crowley conceded, a little disappointedly, moving forwards with the queue. "Your guys should take note. Hand out chocolate to prevent sin."
~ A sympathetic cup of coffee was placed in front of him. “Remind me why you’re doing this again?” Aziraphale asked, slightly bemused.
“I wanted to see what it was like. Figured it couldn’t possibly be that bad if humans kept on having them and yet didn’t stop drinking.”
“And?” Aziraphale prompted, closing the blinds with a gesture and leaving them in a comfortingly dim light.
“They’re all completely insane,” Crowley informed him hoarsely. “It’s like going through Hell and coming back and asking for another go.”
~
#5. Listen to the happy laughter of children.
“I’m sure this wasn’t on my list,” Crowley said suspiciously. “Have you been adding things to my list?”
“Me?” Aziraphale looked as innocent as only an angel could. It was a wonder his halo didn’t manifest with a gratuitous ‘ting!’ to emphasize that innocence.
~ “Crowley, I’ve just seen the news. Did you just destroy the Icelandic economy?” It must have been a success. Aziraphale sounded actually annoyed.
~ “Gavotte,” the angel corrected mildly. “Garrotting is when you cut someone’s head off.”
“Yes, well, not that either.” Crowley scowled. “I had in mind something more… up to date. No-one dances the gavotte now.”
“You don’t dance anything now,” Aziraphale pointed out. “I’ve seen you. You just stand in clubs in your sunglasses and lean against the wall trying to look cool.”
~ “So it’s a machine that could create vacuums? And those vacuums could then suck in the world, and in fact the whole of the universe?”
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“Because they’re humans,” Crowley said glumly. “And humans would end the Universe just to see if it was actually possible. And be really excited, in the last second before they all died, that it actually was.”
~ "Training exercise," Harry said automatically, feeling no shame whatsoever. Memos were made to be creatively destroyed.
~ Harry smiled at her, batting his lashes once or twice--Ginny made him practice that move in the mirror at least once a week, and it'd paid off. Whenever one of them got caught doing something terribly stupid or immature, all he had to do to get them out of trouble was pout a little, bat his eyes, and radiate hurt innocence. It worked like a charm.
Ulyssia was immune, of course, but she thought it was funny, and an amused Ulyssia was a happy Ulyssia. And a happy Ulyssia made deluxe banana bread and mounds of triple chocolate cookies, and always brought some in for her favorite coworkers.

“Well then, Sunny. Uh, apparently you’re going to be a hero at some point. Or possibly a villain. Maybe both, Merlin knows Narcissa Malfoy pulled that one off well enough. Sorry I can't really be too helpful here, but Zabini only gave me your name and address on a post-it. Which was an interdimensional portkey. He didn’t mention that ahead of time, you know. Bit of a rude surprise.”
~ He figured he ought to give the rest of the Department fair warning, though, so he flung open the front door and bellowed, “Zabini! Come out here and get castrated like a man!” There, he thought in satisfaction, as a few startled Unspeakables dropped important and breakable things with loud crashes and numerous curses. That ought to do it. And he’d even avoided what Luna called the ‘Capslock of Rage’, whatever that meant.
~ Anyway, I think Blaise must have been attacked by invisible fairies. It’s the only explanation for how twitchy he was all day. And he kept giggling to himself and then saying ‘Oh Merlin, I’m doomed’.”
~ That was insult enough to make Henry forget centuries of assimilation. He drew himself up to his full height and slapped the man across the face. He wished he'd had a glove, so that he could then throw it to the ground. "You insult my honour, sir, and I demand satisfaction."
~
“NCIS anything like CSI?”
“Only if you’re dyslexic.”
~ You’re going to Gitmo. You do not have the right to remain silent. You do not have the right to an attorney. If you want an attorney, you won't get an appointment to see one. Do you understand these rights you don't have?

“And what about you, Batman?” The silence behind him sounded a great deal like superheroes searching furiously for the nearest exit. Batman took two slow breaths, then turned to face Superman, whose face nearly shone with pure innocence. Fingers itching to throw a punch, Batman didn’t believe for an instant the question was innocent.
~ It might be a sign that he needed a vacation if he’d just thought “ho hum” and “another supervillain” in close proximity. Simply thinking the words “ho hum” was probably a bad sign.
~
John thought this might explain some things about Flash, because Batman-baiting was better fun than he’d expected. It might also be considered reckless and/or suicidal, but hell, he had the most powerful weapon in the universe on his finger. He’d probably survive. “What?” he asked, all innocence.
~
Batman managed to give the impression of a shrug and disdainful sniff without ever actually moving.
~
Batman turned, a batarang snapping into his hand almost magically. He threw it and somewhere in the shadows something went thud.
~
Bruce wondered how many alarms he would set off if he smashed his head against the centre of the console….Bruce considered throwing himself out an airlock.
~
“Yes yes, go ahead and insult me,” Rodney said, wondering how much trouble he’d get in if he shot the little bastard. “Keep in mind that a),” he ticked the points off on his fingers, “I don’t know what a mudblood is, b) I don’t give a rat’s ass, and c) I’m a good deal smarter than you and your only chance of getting home.”
~ “Now you’ve made me hope an aneurysm destroys the part of my brain that conjured up that image.”

“So, does Gibbs ever actually get stuck in the elevator?” Tony stared off into the burnished metal distance and tried to imagine that kind of inanimate temerity. “It wouldn’t dare.”
~
“Stop that! You’re filling my head with images, Padfoot, I don’t want images.” “Neither do I, but I thought I’d share the wealth, since I’ve got them anyway.”
~ “I had a thought.” “Merlin help us,” Remus muttered under his breath. “About Lily.” “There’s a shocker,” Peter mumbled around his bite of chocolate frog.  “And about how to right this wrong,” James scowled at Sirius, “that’s been perpetrated against me.” “Perhaps we should snog in the Great Hall?” Sirius offered. “Perhaps I should gut you with a particularly well placed spell?” James tossed off as he walked over to sit on the edge of Remus’s bed. “Ignoring Sirius…” “As difficult as that is.” Remus didn’t look up from his book.
~ “The last plan you thought was brilliant,” Remus reminded James snappishly, “ended up with you and Sirius covered in sulphur, your clothes in ashes and three months of Saturday detentions for all of us.” “But,” Sirius drawled as he sat up, his chin resting on Remus’s shoulder. “It was brilliant.”
~ “How can you say that? My brilliant plan didn’t end up in anyone bursting into flames, no one’s hair singed off, and absolutely not a one of us has detention. It’s been a glorious day for the de facto House of Black.”
~ “Secondly, you’ve been exposed to exactly three people – James, Lily and myself. Three people, you might notice, who are your closest friends and, after the initial shock of discovery, are still your friends and would remain so even if they found out you were shagging stray cats in the alleys of London. Admittedly, we’d worry you’d happen upon McGonagall, but we’d still be your friends.”
~ “Just call me if anything beeps, flashes or smokes - especially if anything smokes.”
~ “Jayne is not as stupid as he looks,” the ice-man says. “Which isn’t saying much - Jayne looks very, very stupid.” 
~ Simon’s face cleared. “Ah. Actually, Zoë took it upon herself to explain this to me already.” “Huh.” He’d have to thank her for saving him the trouble. “...She told me to ignore you.” “What?” Okay, new Zoë plan: yelling.
~ Ron said nothing more about the picture, or the cupboard under the stairs, and he was unfailingly polite to the Dursleys. But he was tall, lanky and careless, and it wasn’t his fault, he said later, that he’d tripped over a rug and somehow managed to break every single ornament and photo-frame in the sitting room.
~
“By the way,” Ron added, “I’ve been meaning to ask for years. What’s a dentist?”
~ Luna looked up from her close examination of the Grangers’ video collection. “It was very thoughtless, Harry. I’ve heard that Minster Scrimgeour is planning to have you assassinated in a freak troll rampage.”
Harry considered this for a moment. “Nah,” he said. “Wouldn’t work. I’m good with trolls.”
~ There was a brief silence. “You know,” said Luna, “I think we need to consider a different plural for ‘Horcrux’.”
~ Her smile deepened into something truly breathtaking, and Wash had some difficulty paying attention to pesky things like words as she answered.

“What’s wrong with my shirt?”
“Nothing a small fire won’t fix.”
~ “Do you know how long it took me to grow this?  You’re not touching my moustache.”  Zoë didn’t speak, but the look she gave him over her shoulder was answer enough.  “But I like my moustache,” Wash said plaintively.
~ He’d never known the stash of guns existed, but Serenity had all manner of hidden nooks and crannies, which made the “we’re criminals” thing a little obvious, now that he thought about it.
~ For some reason, Wash felt it necessary to lie.  “It was nothing,” he answered, straightening up and out of her grasp, wanting to prove he could walk under his own power.  Which was a bad idea, as it turned out, since he listed immediately to the right and would have toppled ass over teakettle if Zoë hadn’t grabbed a handful of his stupid coat.

“Hey. Looks like we can sign some waivers and for a couple of bucks they’ll let us try jousting.” Sam figured if he first dangled the chance of heavy weaponry in front of his brother’s nose, there might be less bitching about the chess. Plus, seriously, jousting? How cool was that?
~ A peculiar expression flickered across the boy’s face, but he didn’t respond, and Sam wanted nothing more than to take him by the scruff of the neck and march him someplace nice and quiet for a thorough interrogation. Merlin must’ve picked up on that vibe, because he quickly scanned the rest of the tent, as if looking for help from being repressed.
~ Rose picked out six dresses, eight pairs of socks, every pair of shoes she owned and no underwear. Tony said, “You are not growing up to be Paris Hilton.” He emptied her underwear drawer into the duffel bag and put half the shoes back in her closet.
Rosie said, “Who’s Paris Hilton?”
“Good,” Tony said. “Good answer.” 
~ “Oh, God,” James groaned, pressing his face firmly into a cushion. “I could’ve gone to my grave without knowing that, and been happy.” “But how - when did you-” “Peter, you will not, under any circumstances, encourage another word on the subject,” James instructed, lifting his head. “Because if they explain the slightest detail about their physical relationship, I will be forced to Obliviate myself. And then kill you.” Peter looked at Remus and Sirius with wide eyes. “But where do you two...you know...” “Best not to ask,” Sirius said kindly. James made a muffled noise of mingled terror and disgust. “My two poofter friends do not shag in our dormitory,” he chanted to himself. “My two poofter friends do not-” “And never while you’re in there,” Sirius added blithely, clearly enjoying himself. James shot him a wounded look. “James,” Peter said in an awed voice, “this means that you’re the only virgin Marauder.” “I hate you all,” James said, and stuck his face back into the cushion.
~ “You used too much tarantula blood,” he grumbled. Harry was very glad he hadn’t known that before he drank the stuff.
~ Most of the time, despite the ridiculous Muggle proverb, Snape had found that Misery did not, in fact, love Company. Misery wanted Company to bugger off and die so that Misery could sulk in peace. Screaming Agony, on the other hand, liked Company just fine, mostly because Company provided an alternate target.
~ “When you get married, Jason, I’m going to show them to your wife whenever she thinks about having kids.” Holding up an imaginary photo, she adopted a serious tone. “Ma’am, are you sure you really want this to reproduce?”
~
“What are we going to do to him? I vote for explosions.”
“Bastard fucking pepper-sprayed me,” Eliot pointed out. “Whatever the plan is, there needs to be a part where I break his face.” Nate looked inscrutable. “I’ll try to work that in.”
~
“Okay,” said Hardison. “Here’s what’s gonna happen. You sit in that chair and face that screen, and I introduce you to the wonderful world of Azeroth, where Alliance and Horde have united against the curse of the Scourge.” Eliot stared at him. “That’s not even English.”
~ The crossword did provide ten minutes amusement until Hardison came on-line and said, “I got a program that can solve that doing Bayesian regression of the writer’s last two-hundred puzzles and a dictionary,” and then he occupied himself arguing with Hardison over whether or not Google was going to come alive one day and enslave them all. “I’ve seen their algorithms,” Hardison was saying, “They can find out what kind of toothpaste you— wait, he’s just opened his room; he might be going down to the lobby.”
~ Sitting on his kitchen table was a computer that looked like the electronic equivalent of a Navy Seal fixed-blade commando knife, all black surfaces and clean lines with an air of ruthless efficiency. It had a big red bow stuck to the monitor.
~ “It won’t be a problem, I’ll carry them in my jacket,” she told him, and stuffed the cats inside her windbreaker. While they certainly all fit, they would occasionally writhe visibly under its surface, making her look like she was host to some kind of alien parasite, and when they settled down, she looked vaguely pregnant, which was almost as disturbing. Eliot found he couldn’t quite look at her full on; he tried to look like inserting his earpiece required his total attention while they rode the elevator down to the lobby.
~ “Said he was working out some details, and left humming. Did you know he’s tone-deaf? Because I don’t think he knows.”
~
“Oh, sod off, the lot of you,” Lily grumbled good naturedly. “I don’t see what’s so special about charming some balls to fly through the air.” Sirius stopped consulting his notes and looked at her with the same horrified expression also on James and Peter’s faces.  “Evans! This is a complete Quidditch set charmed to play an entire match, 2,748 different matches, to be exact, and only one player needs to play! It’s like playing an entire match by yourself. You can play your position, and the rest takes care of itself. It’s, it’s...” “It’s a thing of beauty,” James supplied. Sirius sighed reverentially.
~ “I’m Lily. I understand my husband has been horribly mistreating you.”
“Have not!” James assumed an entirely unconvincing expression of injured innocence. “All I did was Stupefy him, abduct him, chain him in a dungeon, rifle his wallet and leave him alone with Alastor Moody. I was positively angelic— tell her, Giles.”
“It was the most charming interrogation I’ve ever had,” Giles assured her solemnly.
~
“Hey, did you hear Harry? He can say Padfoot now.”
Remus gave an amused snort. “He probably learned just so you’d stop pestering him. Me, I’m going to teach him how to say useful things. Like, ‘Shut up, Sirius’ and ‘Go away, Sirius,’ and ‘Yes, Sirius, I’m still eating that.’”
“Yeah, like any of those ever did you any good.”
~ “I see you’ve found a new girlfriend.” James bent over him, grinning. His hair was even messier than usual and his glasses were askew, but he otherwise he looked undamaged. “You seem very close. Shall I leave you two alone?”
“Nah.” Sirius glared down at the kelpie that was still wrapped around his leg, grabbed it by the tail and began uncoiling it. “I don’t like her, she’s too clingy.”
~
“Happy now, Moody? We’ve been attacked.”
“Too easy,” Moody grunted.
James rolled his eyes. “Some people are never satisfied.”
~ He held up the thermometer. “Do you think you can shut up for four minutes, or do I have shove it up your arse? This model works both ways.”
~
“Your blood pressure is higher than it’s supposed to be.” He sounded as if he suspected Ethan of elevating it on purpose. 
“That comes from stress,” Ethan told him. “Which, in turn, comes from being kidnapped, poisoned, and held captive by a bunch of sadistic psychopaths. Oh, and the regular torture sessions aren’t helping, either.” 
~
“Nothing. I just, er, think it’s amusing how one of the moons of Saturn orbits in a different direction from the others,” I said, picking a random fact from the textbook and trying to look innocent.
~ James managed to excuse himself from class by the simple expedient of Transfiguring one of the chairs into a hyena, and allowing it to bite him. (If you are wondering why he didn’t simply ask to go to the toilet, I can only refer you to my earlier remarks about geniuses who are complete idiots a fair bit of the time.)
~
“Lupin, you’re an idiot. And that isn’t an insult, it’s a diagnosis.”
~ “Will you stop eating bloody biscuits at me if I say yes?”
“Oh, stop being so paranoid, Severus. I’m not eating biscuits at you. Surely I can eat my own biscuits in my own office if I like?” (Actually, I had been eating biscuits at him, and doing it as annoyingly as possible, and I was pleased that he had noticed.) 
~ “Don’t be absurd. Passwords are merely the least elegant of many possible ways to get around the castle. There is an art and a science to marauding, and it involves knowing how to sweet-talk the portraits. Allow me to demonstrate.” I cleared my throat and explained in my best Arthurian, “Hail, Sir Cadogan, I come hither on a quest! I bring succour to the fair Lady Sybill of the House of Trelawney, for I wish to return some property which the villainous squire Draco of the House of Malfoy hath most basely stolen from her.” The knight nodded gravely, lost his balance, and fell off his pony with a clank.
~ Too late. Blue sparks started firing from her wand in random directions. One of them hit the very last crystal ball, which Severus had just sent up the ladder, and turned it into a polar bear - a truly impressive feat of Transfiguration which I’m sure she could never have accomplished on purpose.
~ “I did not set a polar bear on her!” I protested. “She did that herself.”
~ Even Ron seemed fascinated by a number of the volumes on the shelves, especially one book entitled Decorating with Human Transfiguration; or, How to Make an Umbrella Stand out of Your Enemy.
~
Lupin merely stared blankly at him for a second and said, “Do me a favour, will you? Next time you think I’ve gone out of my mind - tell me so louder and more often, and don’t stop until I listen to you.” 
~ He inspected the bloodstains on the carpet and added, “Expanded list of problems that can’t be solved with tea: Decapitation, being an insufferable, prejudiced brat with the manners of a troglodyte - and carpet cleaning.”
~
“Capitalism is shite. You should join the revolution. What kind of a job?”
~ “I know a joke,” said Peter helpfully. “A troll, a hag, and a leprechaun went into a bar,” he began, and then looked blank for a moment. “Oh yeah. And then they remembered they didn’t drink, so they went to the synagogue instead.” Looking around at his audience, he registered that the joke seemed somehow incomplete. “As you do,” he added hopefully. 
“It might help to know that the last time he told this joke, it was about three rabbis,” James told her.
~
“Again, please, with more explanation and less self-pity?” she said.
~ “Are you –?” Kai started to say, and whatever he was going to finish with was muffled by Dewey suddenly clapping a hand over his mouth.
“It’s really extraordinary, Mercy,” said Dewey slowly.
“It looks like Valentine’s Day bled to death in here,” said Anthony Dreadmoor, before anyone could stop him.
~
“With the kind of moves those brothers have, I’m shocked they didn’t bring more people,” Grant remarked as they picked their way through the emptying parking lot.
Jonesy shrugged. “I said they were jocks, not honour students.”
~ “And if he knows what’s good for him, he’ll keep pretending to be unconscious until Dean leaves.” Sam said the last part louder and directed at the boy on the floor.
~ “How about I help you into a state of unconsciousness, pretty boy?”
“That your favourite pick-up line.” Dean chuckled, ducked his head. “I got to say it really does suit a pansy-ass like you.”
~ “Mom, tell Bridgette to stop talking to dead people in public,” hissed Ariel, “she’s freaking Dad out!”
~
“Are you kidding? It was his idea.”
“Somehow I doubt he comes up with his best ideas while under the influence of narcotics.”
“Well, he did have trouble remembering your name and kept referring to you as the ‘brisket lady’, but he was perfectly sincere when he suggested we do something nice for you. Squirrelly, but sincere.”
“I have to warn you, Alan,” she said, when they reached her car. “We have three kids and no baby-sitter.”
Alan grinned. “I have two grown sons and no grandchildren to play with. Trust me, Allison. That won’t be a problem.” 
When the Dubois family arrived at the Eppes’ house on Saturday, the door was opened by a charmingly distracted man whose attention was drawn immediately to the three younger Dubois. With barely a glance at the two adults, he scratched his head and peered curiously at the young girls, his expression a strange cross between delight and frank befuddlement. 
“This is marvellous,” he said. “Of course, I realized they came in different sizes... Nonetheless, it never occurred to me to consider more than one...”

Once, when Larry managed to get his midterm grades turned in on time, Dad threw a lasagne dinner for the entire physics department.

Scorpius didn’t know what to do with his hands. First he stuffed them in his pockets, but then he thought that was rather too casual, so he clasped them behind his back, but that struck him as much too formal. He finally attempted to affect an air of diffidence by propping one hand on his hip and raking the fingers of the other through his hair. “Er, hullo, Rose,” he said, ignoring his father’s snort as he tried to make his voice sound deeper than usual. “Fancy meeting you here.”
~ “You’d best tell me now what it is you want, so I can say no, and then you can scheme and plot your way to having it anyway.”
~
He has a look –a raised eyebrow – that makes Teddy feel guilty for complaining about anything, because it’s always easier than Harry’s life.
~
It was a nice firm handshake, too - the type of handshake you don’t get much if you’re a skinny blonde girl, especially not from men. Her benignly neutral first impression moved towards vague liking; men who shook hands like equals with skinny blonde girls were a rare and precious commodity.
~
“Why?” Buffy asked, and his grin faltered. “Or, you could pretend I said something tactful there,” she exclaimed hastily, grimacing, “and just ignore that really rude question.”  “Why thank you, but I’m afraid I really don’t remember where I got these robes,” he said, smiling blandly. Buffy blinked and stared. “You said to pretend you said something tactful,” Remus explained, one corner of his mouth quirking upward, taking the smile from bland to decidedly mischievous.
~
Andromeda couldn’t help smiling. “Scorpius, is it?” “I’ve heard quite enough commentary on the subject.” Draco responded.
~
“Keep her...” He whispered, just loud enough for Harry and Ron to hear. “Away from me. Please.” That was all it took; an immediate line of defence was formed. There was always a Weasley there to pick her off and distract her, the minute she seemed to get too close.
~ “How do I look?” Alf asked nervously.
“Like a complete git.” Teddy said immediately.
“Total wanker.” CJ added.
~
“Neville, I believe Harry Potter was planning on arriving this morning to pick up Teddy. Please explain the situation to him, and if possible prevent him from killing Grainsworth.”
“Do I have to?” Neville gave her a grim smirk.
~ He glanced up at his two friends uncertainly. “You’re still speaking to me?” He asked.
Alf turned to CJ. “I thought we were speaking. Did I go mute? I know I saw YOUR lips move?”
“Bloody hell…he’s lost his hearing!” CJ put on a look of mock horror. “That isn’t in the textbooks!”
~
“It is strange, though...” Minerva was looking over a stack of parchment. “Cotswold was normally quite meticulous, but his notes on this incident are incomprehensible...it’s almost as if he were confounded!” Neville and Angelina studiously made a point of looking everywhere but at each other.
~
“How terribly droll, Geoff…did you think that insult up by yourself, or did you spend the past four days in the library working it out?”
“Don’t be stupid, CJ.” Eileen replied. “Rodgers hasn’t got a clue where the library is.”
~
Pursing his mouth in determination, the toddler let go, arms out for balance. He put one foot forward...then tried another...then toppled forward into George’s arms. “PLLLLT!” He said, clearly disgusted with himself.
~ Victoire rolled her eyes at the both of them. “And how’s your love life there, Ted?” she asked in an attempt to turn the tables on him.
“Pathetic,” he said without missing a beat. “I work too much and I’ve pretty much forgotten what girls look like.”
“Did you ever really know?” she asked. “I mean, we all saw Celia.”
~ “Well, I had… seven butterbeers, I think. And some of my dad’s Firewhisky. And then something that tasted like pond, and then Uncle Ron gave me some mead.” A slow grin spread across her face. “My bones feel all bendy.”
~ “You made my mother happy. You made her spin in new dresses and giggle and I can’t hate you because of it.”
~ “Hey.” The blond playfully pushed the mutt. “I’m not that bad of a driver. I’m not, really.” The blond wanted Elena to believe her.
Elena tried to be consoling. “I’m sure you’re not.”
~
She looked up and scowled at their entrance, dark eyes focused on Castiel. “What did I say about the kid and my hair?”
Castiel blinked. “Keep him out of it?”
~
M.A.D., a criminal organization whose main purpose is committing crime and wreaking pointless havoc. Take notice that they don’t mention profit or power as a main goal; those are only unexpected bonuses.
~ The kid was literally shaking. He was frozen in place like a rabbit caught out in the open. Pupils dilated, muscles tense, eyes shifting frantically from side to side. The kid was either about to run or pass out. John spoke to the boy like he was a scared kitten, “Hey...” That was all he got out before a tiny fist socked him straight in the nose.
~ Sam’s voice was distorted with static, “A kid? What kind of kid?” “A kid, kid. They don’t come in magical colours Sammy.”
~ He was, but even there… I’ve beaten Harry in practice duels.  He won most of the time, but I’ve beaten him.  So has everybody in the D.A.   Seamus Finnegan even got Harry to have scrolls made up for each of us, with a Veritas charm, saying “I hereby acknowledge that [name] out-duelled me on [the following date(s)], Signed, Harry Potter.” 
~
“For purposes which don’t require elaboration?”
“For shagging, exactly.”
~ She doesn’t accept that prophecies are real?  Isn’t that like saying you don’t accept the existence of dragons because it’s not possible for animals that size to fly or breathe fire?
~ “There’s no reason to be rude,” Luna said, as if they’d had the conversation many times before. “Or sulky. We’re just being questioned.”
~
“So...” Dean sighed. “Evil Pinocchio.”
“Looks like,” Sam agreed. And that was the end of that.
~ Dean’s comment was met with an abrupt “Shh,” from Sam, which sent his eyebrows soaring. Dean didn’t take to being dismissed without reason by someone who didn’t outrank him, so instead he raised his voice and repeated, “SO GUYS, WHAT’S WITH THE MIME ACT?”
~ Dean seriously doubted there was a Complete Idiot’s Guide to Puppets, or Living Dummies for Dummies that he could just look up, but Sam had been confident that Bobby would be able to drum up something useful. It was at that point Dean had scoffed and remarked that it’s a puppet, Sam. What else do you need to know except that it’s alive and flammable?
~ “Bugger,” a man says and picks her up. “What’s this?” “It’s a small child, Sirius,” another man says. “Which means you shouldn’t swear.” She files bugger as an interesting word to try out later. ~
She realizes that her voice has risen to what sounds suspiciously like a hysterical pitch, and that Thomas Wren is backing away from her cautiously. “Great,” Thomas says, in the tone of voice usually used on people brandishing unidentified magical artefacts that might explode. “I’m glad you’re fine. It’s great that you’re fine.”
~ “She’s Floo’d me twice this afternoon, she’s been very worried. According to your clock you’ve been in Mild Peril most of the day, and Extreme Peril three times this afternoon.”
~ So here’s the deal. Because the Sci-Fi Channel can’t turn Sci-Fi into a brand name due to it being a genre, they changed the name to SyFy. I find it hilarious that I have yet to find a response that wasn’t mocking laughter. And while I’ve seen a lot of responses to how stupid the whole thing is, I will say that their new slogan, “Imagine Greater,” momentarily bashed me in the forehead with enough force to destroy any grasp I had on the English language. I mostly babbled about car wash apple squirrel conquistadors for five minutes, and then I fell down. I want to find the candy-overdosed seven-year-old who flunked spelling that they got to come up with that slogan and I want to take away his Darth Vader costume. Trust me, he’s wearing one. It’s possible he wears it during bathtime, and I hate him for it. Take that off, you hyper space monkey, you’ve lost all right to wear it. I think we should start pronouncing it the way it looks -- SeeFee. I don’t have a witty remark to go with that. I think the moronic sound you make when you say it out loud works fine on its own.

“I felt better hours ago. I’ve been totally milking it.”
~ “Okay,” Ned said forcefully. “Okay, here’s what we’re going to do. We’re not going to use my magic finger and we’re not going to send Chuck out to her zombie brethren.”
~ “Don’t worry, Oz.” Cassie encouraged as she collected all the tools that had been used. “Jack would like to shoot Maybourne,” called Cassie over her shoulder and she left to clean the instruments.
Jack cheerfully rocked back on his heals. “Sure would, actually I did shoot Maybourne, twice, but that was because . . .”
~ Tony hadn’t been beaten, drugged, kidnapped, or misplaced as he was wont to do; and there had been no abused children or broken families that seemed to penetrate the walls of the agent’s cool exterior. It hadn’t taken long after meeting DiNozzo in Baltimore to see that the kid had more masks than a travelling theatre, and it only took their first major case together at NCIS for Gibbs to be able to see through most of them.
~
“Yeah, I was a cub scout. They kicked me out for trying to score Brownie points.”
~ “Daniel, it’s a good plan, but you know Jack’s gonna have my head on a platter just for bringing you this far, don’t you?”
Daniel smiled faintly. “Well, if you’re already dead meat, a little further can’t hurt, can it?”
~ Besides, Lois was smart enough not to commit a crime in front of security cameras. Hell, if Lois wanted Ralph dead he’d be dead, the body would never be found, and she would have an airtight alibi for the time of his disappearance.
~
Dean huffed a laugh. “Hey, that was totally legit. I’d already made it around the house twice.”
“Yeah, after tying my feet together with the hose.”
A loose shrug. “No rule said I couldn’t.”
~
Sam snorted. “Dude, we both got our asses handed to us by a cheerleader—”
“A thousand year-old witch cheerleader,” Dean corrected with an upraised finger.
~
He spit out the toothpaste, rinsing to give himself a moment to gather his thoughts. All that came out, however, was, “What were you doing in my wallet?”
“Seriously? You’re walking around with black magic in your pocket, and that’s all you care about, what I was doing in your wallet?”
~
“Who have you been talking to?”
“Thomas,” Molly grinned. “He wanted to gain my trust, so he spilled your secrets.”
~
“Be a gentleman, would you Dresden and get the guns. They’re in my trunk.”
~
“I fail to understand this character... and I do not see how there is any notable difference in this drink depending on whether it is “shaken or stirred”.”

“No, it’s not. Sam Winchester is a guy. Who is this really? Did Shawn put you up to this?”
The voice was weary when it said, “Juliet, it really is me. It’s Sam.”
“Uh huh. Look, I’m sure Shawn paid you very nicely, but I have work to do and-”
“You were afraid of horses as a child because one bit your hand when you went to a farm on a fourth grade field trip.”
Juliet froze. “How did you-”
“Because you told me when you were concussed.”
“I . . . Sam?”
“Unfortunately.”
“But you’re-”
“Unfortunately.”
“How . . .” She closed her eyes. “No. Wait. I don’t think I want to know.”
“It was Dean’s fault.”

Sophie managed to convey withering scorn and self-deprecation in the same tinkling laugh.
~ “None of your business,” Parker said, which pretty much guaranteed that Nate was now going to snoop.
~
The problem was, thinking wasn’t so much Eliot’s specialty -- not that he was dumb, he’d pulled off the thing in Bangkok, and that had taken some smarts, and he could count cards like a pro because he was -- but he had the sort of brain that made snap decisions and then put his body in the best place to carry them out. He just wasn’t the type to make relationship pros and cons lists, or put together elaborate seduction schemes, and the one time he’d tried, with Parker and the kittens, it had taken Nate and Sophie to make it actually work anyway. His version of deciding whether to court someone came down to whether they seemed interested and then just sort of going for it.
~
He knew what to do with women with relationships, so far as he’d had them - he bought them flowers and carried their bags when they shopped and cooked for them, until they got sick of unexplained absences and weird injuries and not taking them to their cousin’s wedding because he’d been a little occupied with that shark tank in Dubai.
~ The gun skittered over the concrete floor as Fish caved around his solar plexus. Eliot made a mental note of where it had landed, grabbed the back of Fish’s head and brought his knee up. There was a crunch of expensive dental work. Fish made a noise that was more gurgle than scream, collapsing in a way that satisfied Eliot on a very deep level.
~ Eliot is what Nana would have called a restless sleeper, and what Alec calls - in his head, because he isn’t a moron - one paranoid motherfucker.
~
“Specifically, man, you have a bed. A bed all to your own where you don’t have to punch me in the gut.” “It was one time,” Eliot protests, still looking at the keys. There is a thumping noise from down the hall, which is probably Parker exploring the exit from her room via the airshaft.
~
It took him nearly half an hour to subscribe Eliot to all the magazines on fluffy white-boy hair-styling he could find, and he signed him up for a couple of glossy informational brochures on hair-plugs besides. He broke briefly when the alarm went off for the cookies, and actually struggled for a moment over whether or not he wanted to take the cookies out of the oven, or let them burn. Then his good sense prevailed and he decided setting fire to tasty cookies in his own oven might not be the best repayment, so he pulled them out, and tried one. It burnt his hand, and was delicious.

Alec tried to surreptitiously scrub his tongue on his teeth, and swung his feet out onto the floor, wondering if it would be a good move to get dressed; he might feel a bit more moral-high-ground-ish if he wasn’t wearing boxers that read “There’s No Place Like 127.0.0.1”.

“You get this look sometimes,” Max explains. “This thing in your eyes when you’ve done something incredibly stupid and are forced to come crawling to me for help. So spit it out already.”
~ Max bites her lip for a moment and then she’s gone again dissolving into fits and laughter and under other circumstances, it would be a welcome sight. With the year she’s had, Max deserves to laugh until she cries. He opens his mouth, almost ready to tell her that but she’s pointing at his chest and looks red in the face and he decides never to ever speak to her again.
~ Alec sits silently in the passenger’s seat as Logan drives and very studiously Does Not Look at him.
~ “Yes,” Logan says with a completely straight face. “Frog DNA gave you boobs.” Alec doesn’t know why he’s even surprised.

~ She always glares at him and tells him not to be a slob, but secretly she loves the way he takes over a room, every inch of it, and makes it his. His simple joy in life spreads with his possessions and marks of passage until you can’t help but feel that, somehow, the room is now a part of him, instead of the other way around.

It’s amazing how often the intricacies of his supposedly complicated job still come down to “what happens when I pour this stuff on this flammable material?”

“It’s nice to meet you,” the woman greeted.
“And you as well,” Severus returned, in a tone that any reasonable person would have understood meant the exact opposite.

“Bite your tongue.” He considered leaving it there, but knowing Minerva she’d probably just continue to make ridiculous suggestions until he gave in and told her who the woman had actually been. Or, worse, disbelieve him and make vague references to his ‘special friend’ for the foreseeable future, no doubt involving some of the rest of the faculty as she went.
~
“Or what?” Jon said, unable to resist. “You’ll bruise my hand with your guts again?”
~
“Jack here – well, not really, but I will be when I get back to you about your message. If this is an emergency or otherwise ‘minor’ important, you should know by now that my damned house phone is not the sheriffs’ office – call there first.”
~
Sure... he’s depressed so he jumps four stories out of a window onto his head. “Wow, that feels better.” Picks himself up. “Now I think I’ll go on with the rest of my day.”
~
“Hey, Sid, the tiger found a shortcut.”
“No thanks, I choose life.”
~ Well, I suppose we can talk about that. (His wife gives him a look) Tomorrow. Or the next day. Or next week. (Looks at his watch) Oh, will you look at that, it’s time to go. These are handy. You want a watch for your birthday?
~
“This is the captain. We have a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight...turbulence and then...explode.”
~
“Your family’s Jewish, you guys don’t hide eggs.”
“I know, all those mindless hours of searching.”
~
“Yes, he’s a former drug addict. I myself am a former high school student, and everyone here used to poop in their pants. Your point?”
~ “Turn on the heat. It doesn’t work, but it makes a very annoying noise - distracts from the cold.”
~ “One, I’m psychic. Two, you talk in your sleep.” Sam grinned. “And three, Dad told me all about it before I left for Stanford.”
~ “In my defence,” Sam said, raising his hands. “He killed me first.”
~
“What, building a light show for the local carnival? Oh, no, I somehow doubt that. You’ve got the genetic programmer right there on your desk!”
“It’s a paper weight!” Yeah, Jared, that sounded real convincing. I already knew I worked for an idiot, but this was just a little pathetic.
~
“What?” Apparently the mystery man was just as baffled as I was. “Why would we fight to death?”
“Because you’re trying to stop me. Isn’t that how it goes?”
“No!” The mystery man was quiet. “Well, sometimes.” There was a hint of bitterness in the tone. “But there’s usually running first.”
~
…after he comes back from what she comes to call his “pilgrimage” and what he refers to as “the freak-out that brought me back.”
~
“Not sleeping on the couch.” Sam pauses for dramatic effect. “You do know where babies come from right, Dean?”
~ “You love me?” he says, looking down at her with wide, blinky, hazel eyes and more question mark in his tone than necessary.
~ Three separate guys come up and offer to buy Sam a beer, clapping their hands on his back with variations of, “Hormones! I feel you, man.”
~ Sam’s still pacing and swearing hours later when Meghan’s contractions are coming every two and half minutes by Dean’s stop watch.  “Sam!” she screams, “Either get with the program and stop freaking out or get the hell out of the room.”
~
“You’d be good at marriage. You’re both controlling and disapproving.”
~
“We could always make it strip poker.”
“Sorry, but I prefer mystery to horror.”
~
“Are you kidding? A control freak like you with something you can’t control? This is going to be more fun than Shark week.”
~ When I was your age I - wait. I can’t tell that story. It’s wildly inappropriate. Which, oddly enough, is my point. Don’t you want wildly inappropriate stories that you can’t tell your children?
~
“Mr. Castle, be advised: if you get injured following Detective Beckett, you cannot sue the city. If you get shot, you cannot sue the city. If you get killed, your lifeless remains cannot sue the city?”
~ “You know, actually having to prove things is really tedious.”
~
“You assume that, just because she’s a woman, she was after a relationship. Did you ever think maybe she was in it for the sex?”
“Yes I did – and then I saw him.”
~
“Reading a paper? You are going to lose all of your wired-teen-hyper-texting-nano-gizmo street cred.”
“I’m a rebel. I kick it old school.”
“Style section, I see. Anything I need to know?”
“The seventies are back. They’re like the Highlander, they just won’t die.”
~
“Morning, mother. You’re dressed early.”
“I have class.”
“That’s debateable.”
~
“So, what do you think? Why’d the murderer let the body float away in the boat?”
“Well, the Vikings believed that if you wanted to reach Valhalla, you needed a vessel.”
“Gun-toting Viking? That’s your theory?”
“No, no. They also launched their dead with a sacrificial woman, and some booze, and a good horse.”
~
“Did you know, in the original Greek, tragedy meant goat song? Whatever that first story was, I can’t help but think, bad things must have happened to that goat.”
~
“Do you do drugs? You can tell me, you know.”
“No, I don’t.”
“Are you sure?”
“Dad, am I lethargic and uncharacteristically irritable?”
“No.”
“Are my eyes bloodshot for no apparent reason?”
“No, except when you’re sick.”
“Well, that’s an apparent reason. Are my grades plummeting?”
“No.”
“Then according to New York City’s Guidelines for Parents and Teachers, it’s a pretty safe bet I’m clean.”
“You make an excellent case.”
~
“You’ve got to be kidding me. I already told the brass we got the right guy.”
“I can see how that could be a little awkward.”
“Look, I know that we love the violent drug dealer for this, but his story makes more sense than our witness’. Plus, and I know I’m new here, but aren’t we supposed to arrest the right guy?”
~ “If you don’t want someone to plug shit in? Don’t provide a plug. Just sayin’.”
~
“Promise not to hate me?”
“I already hate you.”
“Well, this can’t hurt then.”
~
“Damn, those are some seriously fine five-star, Class B misdemeanours,” he exclaimed, staring at the whores.
~
“You tell Jeff that I want my statement of outrage and sympathy in his damn article, or else.”
~
“Wait, so you’re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her right there, right now, you’ll just walk away?”
“I said I’m her friend, not her gay friend.”
~
“Hey, I’m not the one who was dipping his churro into sugar half his age.”
~
“Most of the men who come to me are lonely and need the company. The sex is just one of the ways for them to feel connected.”
“So, when did the two of you last ‘connect’?”
~
“Judy called. She says if you don’t show up tomorrow night she will ‘drip honey on your eyeballs and let loose a hundred fire ants’,” she read off the paper. […]
“Dad, where are you?”
“Why? Where am I supposed to be?”
“Fire ants? Eyeballs?”
~
“Fine, you put up with it if you want to, but I won’t. I’m a fighter. I fight stuff like this.”
“No, you don’t.”
“Shut up, Phil. I would if I thought I could win.”
“No, remember there was that thing last week you thought you could win and you still didn’t fight it? Remember? With the sandwich?”
“Hey, Dave, do you think I don’t fight injustice enough?”
“Is this about the sandwich? Because I think instinctively you knew you wouldn’t have won that. Your mom’s tough.”
~
“Oh, you’re having a hallucination? Cool. What do you see?”
“You.”
~ I had totally forgotten how strange DayQuil makes me. I mean, yes, Vix + antihistamines = good time had by all, but for some reason I forgot to put DayQuil in that mental category… My toes are fascinating.
~ If The Fast and the Furious can make me, who is not precisely a girly girl but who is definitely in touch with her estrogeny bits, drive like a jackass even two days later, I can only imagine what it does to seventeen year old boys.
~ “And of course he’s Orion - if you didn’t see that coming then you probably haven’t ever watched television.”
~ “And so clever. Too clever. Matter of fact, I don’t like her anymore. I’ve just decided.”
~ “I’m addicted to television. I got two TVs in my house, and there’s only one of me.”
~ “I’m hungry. Can I eat something? That?” He didn’t even look where she was pointing, just said, “No.” She retracted her pointing hand. When he glanced over barely three seconds later she had a mouthful of something. Hadn’t even seen her move, not that he would have expected to. He thumped down the knife and faced her. “What’d you take?” She shrugged. “If you can’t tell, it couldn’t have been important.” In her mind, he realised, she probably equated ‘no one noticed it was missing’ to ‘not really stealing’.
~ He looked down and chopped a couple chillies very intently. Then he grabbed a few more and chopped those too. Hell yes, leaving the seeds in, because he felt a sudden need to burn everyone’s taste buds off. Even if that included his own - he was fine with taking them all down with him.
~ “Are you sure?” Sophie was saying in her therapist voice. “Sometimes talking about a disturbing dream, you know, letting yourself experience it in a calm, safe environment, helps with the trauma.” “What about my trauma?” Eliot muttered, only not quietly enough. “Yeah, what about Eliot’s trauma?” Parker asked. “Because there was a lot of it.” Eliot chopped harder. “In the dream,” she added, before finally, thankfully, falling silent. Sophie rolled her eyes and dropped the subject in favour of frowning at him. “How much of that are you putting in?” He pointed the knife at her without looking up. “No back-seat cooking.” He touched a spoon to the curry base and touched the spoon to his tongue. After a few seconds, when he could still see, he decided the others would be fine.
~ Lately, he’d found himself occasionally longing for the days when all he had to worry about was whether someone had been in his room. With Parker and Sophie, you knew they had been, and it was more a question of what they’d stolen, what kind of surveillance equipment they might have left behind, and whether or not anything would be exploding any time soon.
~ Sophie crossed her arms over her chest and gave Eliot that look of hers, the one that said, ‘I already know, so you may as well confess, you know you’ll feel so much better when you do, and then maybe I’ll take my shirt off as a reward’. The woman could get a lot into a single facial expression. But where on anyone else it would be impressive, for Sophie it was like saying ‘hi’. He remembered one time after they’d only been working together officially for a few weeks. She’d touched his arm lightly, looked at him, and the next thing he knew, he’d been moving furniture in her office for like an hour while she just stood there and kept changing her mind.
~ Okay, so the truth was, there was a story. It was a pretty good one. But explaining it all would A, take too long, and B, require Eliot to kill them afterward.
~ “Oh - I - you know that - you did not - I date, okay? People. Plenty of peop - girls. Women. Shut up.” He drank his soda fiercely.
~ “What do you want with-” Hardison stops, maybe he is learning after all. “No, you know what, the things you do in your free time, I do not need to know.” “It’s just an idea I had. Did you know in Finland, bear meat-” “EBay,” Hardison interrupts helpfully, before they learn any more new, and interesting, things. “You could try EBay.”
~
“You don’t know, or you can’t say?”
“I don’t know, but if I did, I probably couldn’t say.”
~
“You were standing where he was pouring.”
“He should have anticipated. Have him hung.”
“Hanged. Laundry is hung. Valets are hanged.”
~ “Never judge a trans-dimensional psychic artefact by its cover, Martha.”
~
“I’m from the South. I hate Lorem. But, now that I’m king, I can’t have a favourite team. I used to break things when they won.”
~
“Dangerous?” He waves his hand dismissively. “No, no. Not at all.” Rose waits for it, counting the seconds, and when she reaches twelve, he glances at her and adds, “Well. Dangerous-ish. You could say that. Radiation, eyes, brain, long periods of exposure, yes, I’d say it’s dangerous. Maybe.”
~
The three men took stock of their surroundings, weighed out the possibilities of bribery (no money), escape (no tools) and rescue (best choice), then turned around to regard the other two captives.
~ All three men nod at one another in the universal male gesture for ‘how’s it going, not bad, you?’
~ If Chuck is a conduit for the Inspired Word, does that mean God is a crappy writer? No, it’s OK, don’t answer that. I’ve read Deuteronomy.
~ So, the whole “prophets are protected by archangels” thing? Dear Show, You are aware that prophets get murdered in the Bible all the time, right? Like how Jezebel had 500 of them put to death? Or, you know, John the Baptist? …Oh wait, what’s that? You haven’t read the Bible? Well, you could knock me down with a feather! Biblically yours,
~ Dear Chuck’s archangel, Oh, hey, did you ever think maybe causing an earthquake which makes large chunks of wood and plaster fall from the ceiling in the room where the guy you’re supposed to be protecting is currently situated is maybe not the best idea ever?…Not very bright, these archangels. Pity, really.
~ “Why is it my job to keep you entertained?” Sam asks. He’s been reading some old book for the last hundred miles, and Dean would totally be jealous except he figures whatever book Sam’s reading is almost certainly more boring than Ohio. And come on, that’s pretty goddamn boring.  “Because I’m the driver, idiot,” says Dean. “And right now I’m considering crashing into a tree just for something to do.” Not that there are any trees to crash into round here. Just, like, seventy million acres of corn. Corn, for Christ’s sake. If there’s anything more boring than corn, Dean doesn’t want to know about it.
~ “Look, uh, I appreciate your enthusiasm. Really, I do. It’s always nice to hear from a fan. But for your own good I strongly suggest you get a life.”
~
“I’m sitting in a laundromat reading about myself sitting in a laundromat reading about myself. My head hurts. “Sam turned his back on Dean. His face brooding and pensive.” I mean, I don’t know how this guy is doing it but this guy is doing it. I can’t see your face but those are definitely your pensive and brooding shoulders. (Sam pauses) You just thought I was a dick.”
~
“He said he’s paying for my drinks, right? Well then I’d like a large glass of something expensive.”
~
“Not really personal-personal, Boss. Sort of work-related personal,” he explained sheepishly.
~
“In deference to the head wound, I’m not gonna smack you this time,” Gibbs replied magnanimously.
~
“Four stiches!” Tony protested, losing his battle to be brave about it. “The ambulance guy said ‘a couple’. Even I know ‘a couple’ is two!”
“I can practically guarantee there will be no scar with five stitches, otherwise,” Ducky shrugged to indicate the situation was completely out of his hands. 
“Scars are cool,” Tony decided hastily. “Some women actually like scars. In fact they’re better than tattoos.”
~
“She wanted to kill me,” Tony stated matter-of-factly. “I think she knew she was dying. She asked me to come with her. I just didn’t realize where at the time.”
~ “That’s where I would have stabbed him,” Abby replied, still absorbed in the game. Dead silence reigned around her, forcing her to look up. “I’m just sayin’; if I ever got mad enough to actually stab a guy, which I would never do, I’d go for the ‘nads.”
“I never thought I’d ever say this to a woman,” Tony declared, staring at her in appalled fascination, “Abby, get out of my bed.”
~ “Thromnla’mnxeq,” Rose says, tripping over the sounds that don’t exist in the English language.
The Doctor winces. “Close.” “My mother,” Jack says, “did no such thing.”
~
“No. Yes. I don’t know about the universe thing, and she’s not my sister, but she is a reader.... Yes.” Kaylee is anxious, because people are afraid of that kind of thing, and River ain’t easy to explain. “It’s not like she can read your mind or anything, she just knows things sometimes. Visions, like....” She gestures vaguely, not sure what to say, or how much. “Visions. She don’t mean nothing by it.” “Oh, good,” Rodney says, because this whole galaxy obviously hates them. “The people advanced enough to have spaceships and be blasé about telepaths live in another space-time continuum.”
~ “Is that a security risk?” a wolf asks. “I mean....” He shrugs, and his thoughts say they’re harmless and the mind-reader girl is a little crazy.
~ The Major deliberately thinks loud enough for her to hear, and she asks, “What’s a wooden nickel?” She can feel Rodney glare at him. “Oh, funny. Mock me via the strange girl telepath, that’s mature.”
~ “A monster ate us,” John said. He couldn’t think of a way to break it gently.
“What the hell are you--” Rodney pushed past them both into the cockpit. He stopped, staring at the tonsils. “Oh God. That’s not-- Tell me that’s not--”  Carter let go of John, stepping forward, staring incredulously. “Oh yeah, this is a new one.”
~ Rodney had said grimly, “The first thing we need to figure out is if its stomach acid can eat through the jumper’s shielding.” There was a moment of horror while everybody thought through the implications of that, then they got to work.
“The jumper’s exterior is impervious to vacuum, cold, heat, all but the strongest radiation,” Teyla pointed out. “Would it not be impermeable to something like this? As long as the creature does not contract and crush us—” From the rear cabin, Zelenka made a little noise of distress.  “Yes, but we don’t know anything about this thing. It could eat rock and metal,” Rodney told her, brow furrowed as studied the sensor readouts. “And jumpers might be the equivalent of a light snack.” He added glumly, “I wish Simpson was a xenobiologist.”  Simpson leaned away from the panel to frown at him. “Why me?”  Rodney waved a hand. “If I was a xenobiologist it would be an obscene waste of my abilities--”  “What about me?” Zelenka demanded.  Rodney snorted. “I barely trust you as an engineer, let alone a--”  John said, “Rodney.” Simpson was glaring at Rodney with narrowed eyes and Zelenka was muttering in Czech. The last thing they needed was a scientist cage-fight.
~ “Remind me to tell you about the time I got turned into an alien mind-controlled zombie,” he had told Ronon ruefully. By then, Ronon had known that wasn’t a joke.
~ Markeos said, “It is the custom of my people to drink the blood of our guests.”  I heard that wrong, Teyla thought, and turned to him. “Did you say--”  “Blood is the life,” Markeos said, and smiled. His teeth were sharply pointed. Apparently he was serious. He grabbed at her shoulders, and Teyla punched him in the face, very hard. […] Markeos, his nose bleeding, blocked the doorway, surrounded by more Leosians. They all bore sharp implements, swords and pikes, and some of them carried chains. Markeos said, “No one has ever escaped us. We will take your blood, as we have all the others, and—” “You have got to be kidding me,” John said. Then he shot Markeos in the foot. Markeos screamed and fell down. The other Leosians scattered.
[…]Rodney stared at him. “No, no, there are not real vampires on Earth. What’s wrong with you?”  “Well, no, but--” John turned to Markeos, still limping after him, and the other Leosians. “Look, you freak, seriously, if you don’t leave us alone, I’m going to drive a stake through your heart.”  Markeos stopped, staring. “What?”  John said, “It’s the custom of my people to stab your people in the heart with a wooden stake. And if you don’t back the hell off right now, I’m starting with you. Got it?”  “I’ll get some sticks,” Ronon said, drawing his long knife and thoughtfully eyeing the nearest tree. “How long?” “Stakes?” Teyla said dryly, giving John a skeptical look.  “Hey, I’m not making it up,” he told her. “When we get back, I’ll show you a vampire movie.”  “You will not.” Teyla had no intention of budging on this point. “It is my turn to choose the movie and I wish to see Steel Magnolias again.”
~ “Ronon, god damn it,” Sheppard said, his voice thick, shaking the way it did when he was fighting back strong emotion. “We thought—” Sheppard clamped his jaw shut. Sheppard had thought Ronon was dead, but he had still meant to search the burning valley for him. You couldn’t ask for more than that. Ronon said, “Ow,” which was all he could manage.
~ “That person who is supposed to be me is wearing a metal bra and panties,” she said thoughtfully. “That is...disgusting. Also cold and surely uncomfortable.”
~ John woke to a hollow-eyed Ronon leaning over him, growling, “If we don’t get out of here today, I’m going to kill McKay.” From somewhere behind John’s head, Rodney’s voice snapped, “If we don’t get out of here today, I’m going to let you kill me.” Zelenka muttered, “Always you make promises, Rodney, and never keep them.”
~ “There could still be giant...water...things,” Zelenka contributed worriedly.
~ He looked up to see everyone staring at him. “Yes, you did say that out loud,” Rodney assured him.
~ O’Neill put his 9mm to Arek’s forehead and said, “Now, look me in the eye and tell me you didn’t touch them.” With a pleasant smile that made him look like a serial killer, he added, “I’m a hard sell, so make it convincing.” Rodney might possibly have been yelling “Shoot him! Shoot him!” during this period. But Arek had been sufficiently convincing, and had begged and cried a little, and nobody got shot.
~ “The blue warbles are in the tent,” Teyla said, then looked at her hands as if she had never seen them before.
~ “Should I hit him?” Ronon asked O’Neill. “He’s hysterical.” O’Neill opened another cabinet, frowning thoughtfully. “Does Sheppard let you?” “No,” Ronon admitted. “He does it himself.” Rummaging through the cabinet, apparently taking inventory of dishes and pots, O’Neill said, “Then we’ll wait till he wakes up.”
“Do you even have a plan?” Rodney snarled. O’Neill pulled out a frying pan. “We wait until base dials in for check-in, tell them to send a jumper, then we go home.” Rodney flailed in exasperation. “That’s not a plan, that’s what we were going to do anyway!” O’Neill stared warily at him and Ronon lifted a derisive brow. “Fine, I’m hysterical!” Rodney shouted, and went to figure out how to work the stove.
~
“No. I’d have probably just shot the traders.” Ronon shrugged and scratched his beard. “Even if I’d thought of it, I’d have probably still just shot the traders.”
~ “Drugged?” Sheppard frowned slowly, biting his lower lip, the expression he got when he was trying to decide if he should admit that he had no idea what was going on. “By the pickled fish sauce?”  “No.” Rodney buried his face in his hands and moaned. It had been a really long day. “I’ll tell you later. But if anyone asks, O’Neill’s your father. And Teyla’s father.” Teyla opened one eye and stared at him in bleary horror.  O’Neill popped into the doorway, making everybody flinch. “I’m making pancakes,” he informed them archly, lifted a brow, then withdrew. Ronon was already standing in the kitchen expectantly holding a plate.
~ “There is a sleeping room for you, down the hall. Your wife is there.” “Uh.” She was already out the door. John looked helplessly at Rodney. Rodney waved it away. “Don’t worry, she means Teyla.” Okay, that was a relief. “So I’m married to Teyla?” 
Rodney rolled his eyes, turned him around, and helped yank the heavy fabric up over John’s shoulders. “We’re all married to Teyla. Great Grandma the High Matriarch got it into her head and nobody can talk her out of it. And no, they don’t have plural marriage in their culture, she just decreed that we do.” That sounded like a job for Elizabeth and a follow-up diplomatic relations team.
~
Rodney folded his arms at the motherly woman, saying briskly, “Yes, you’ve terrorized us into submission, now please go away.” He told John, “By the way, you’re delicate and underfed, and we don’t take care of you.”  “It’s true,” John solemnly told the old woman.
~
“Don’t touch my skirt, Rodney.” John curled up defensively under the robe. “Besides, I think she’s seen a man’s kneecap before.” Snorting, laughing helplessly, Teyla fell over on the fur rug. “I will cover my eyes.” Note to self, find pants before Lorne’s team gets here, John thought, yawned, and dropped off to sleep again.
~ Rodney flung his arms in the air. “You were both-- You were blue. Ronon was dead. We had to let them take care of you because we had to do CPR on Ronon, we were just lucky they knew what to do for hypothermia. If they hadn’t-- You were blue.” His shoulders slumped, and he added weakly. “And I have a headache.” There wasn’t a lot John could say to that. Ronon, woken again by the yelling, grumbled, “I wasn’t dead.” “You shut the hell up,” Rodney snapped. ~
“Did you volunteer?”  “Yes, sir,” Lorne said immediately. Then he hesitated, as if debating how much to say. “Well, I...” John nodded wearily. “Yeah, that was how I volunteered, too.” Rodney swept in suddenly, dumped an armload of files on the table, and shouted, “They don’t need that Asgard particle accelerator, they’re just selfish bastards!” He stared at Lorne suspiciously. “Who the hell is that?” John rubbed his eyes. “This is Major Lorne. He’s my new 2IC.” Rodney eyed Lorne skeptically. “Yes, I’m sure he’ll fit right in with our crazy Marines and the Athosians who swore fealty to you in blood and offered to bear your children. Does he even have the Ancient gene?” Lorne turned to John, deadpan. “Sir, does he know I can hear him?”
~ Rodney sighed in exasperation. “You know you’re being completely irrational, right? The first aid manual said that one of the symptoms of inner ear injuries was irrationality.” Sheppard said pointedly, “That was irritability and it was for ear infections.” Rodney rolled his eyes. “When Beckett gets here, he’s just going to have someone stun you and drag you out.” Teyla, pulling rations and foil blankets out of her pack, glared at him. “What?” Rodney demanded. “Like he doesn’t know that. You know that, right?” he added to Sheppard.
~
Everybody was in dress uniforms or suits, and there was red, white, and blue bunting hanging on the gateroom walls. It’s not a trap, John thought, not realizing until that moment the lingering fear had still been in the back of his head. He also didn’t realize he had said it aloud until Rodney folded his arms, eyeing the group with deep irony, and replied, “True. The bunting is a good indicator. Not even O’Neill would be that diabolical.” ~
John put on a fake relaxed smile and started Operation “Try Not to Look Crazy.”
~ “Dr. Weir, Major Sheppard, this is Emmett Bregman,” Jackson said, looking as if he was here under protest. “He’s a journalist,” he added, with the same expression that he might have used to say “Goa’uld spy.”
~ Elizabeth always gave him a definitive slight nod for yes or a barely perceptible head shake for no, though about half the time O’Neill just rolled his eyes, which John felt could be interpreted as “Jesus, what a stupid question.” Then there was a question where O’Neill shook his head and Elizabeth nodded, and John had to choke himself on a cup of punch to avoid answering.
~ “Great. We can share a cell in Leavenworth. If you try to take the bottom bunk, I’ll shiv you. And I don’t want to be your boyfriend.” “Yeah, don’t worry about that, because I’d rather shiv myself,” Bates assured him sincerely.
~ There was something-not-human in the elevator. John’s brain went from I’m unarmed to Teyla’s unarmed to wait, that’s an Asgard. John realized he had grabbed Teyla to shove her behind him, she had tried to shove in front of him, and they were now clutching each other dramatically. They let go in mutual embarrassment.
~ Rodney’s breakfast rant that morning was pretty intense, and John said three times, “You’re crazy. You know you’re crazy, right? Are you even listening to yourself?” without making any impression whatsoever.
~ Then a blue Mustang purred up next to them. Sheppard leaned out the window, wearing his black aviator glasses. “Get in,” he said. “We’re taking Teyla to Vegas.” Rodney stared. “First question: Why?” Used to reading expression past the dark glasses, Rodney could tell Sheppard thought this was a stupid thing to ask. He said, “Because General O’Neill threw car keys at me and said, ‘take Teyla to Vegas.’”
~ She told Rodney, “Walter gave me a packet that holds all the necessary documents for travel, and explained their uses, and under what circumstances we must produce them.”
~ Teyla emerged clutching a shopping bag whose contents probably cost more than a year’s GNP of Athos pre-Wraith culling. She said, “There are more ‘stores’ like this?” “No,” Rodney said immediately. “Just this one.” Sheppard, who had left his IQ in the SGC gateroom, said, “Sure. Lots.” Teyla nodded soberly. “I wish to see all of them.” Rodney was horrified to discover that she wasn’t joking.
~ Rodney tipped the bellman extra for pretending not to notice that his backpack and Teyla’s leather satchel and shopping bags were their only luggage and for not implying by so much as an eyebrow twitch that he thought anybody was a prostitute.
~ Then O’Neill’s voice demanded suspiciously, “McKay, are you in a stripper bar?” Rodney rolled his eyes. “Yes, General, I took Teyla Emmagen to a titty bar because I want to die by being thrown through a plate glass window.”
~ Then Daniel Jackson called, saying, “McKay? Do you know where the Ancient cable interface is to download the--” Rodney shouted, “I’m off the clock!” and hung up on him.
~ John ate a pretzel, watching him narrowly. “Do you know Master Bra’tac?” Rodney took a deep calming breath. “You are just drunk enough to be stupid.” Teyla sat down at the table, asking seriously, “Are the Blue Men human or are they like the Asgard?” Rodney couldn’t pry them out of the damn bar until four in the morning.
~ When Rodney managed to drag himself out of bed the next day, Sheppard was on the couch, channel surfing with a speed which suggested terminal ADD.
~ But then they stumbled on an upscale strip mall and Teyla remembered that she hadn’t quite worn the numbers off Rodney’s credit cards. In the first store she held up a lace nighty-like garment and said, “Do you think Dr. Simpson would like this?” Rodney stared, and made a strangled noise of horror. Teyla just frowned thoughtfully, eyeing the translucent material. “Or Dr. Weir?”  Sheppard’s eyes got big and he said, “Uh, I can’t know that.” Rodney flung a credit card at her, said, “Buy whatever you want,” and dragged Sheppard to the electronics place next door. Ten minutes later, he froze. “Wait a minute,” he said, turning to Sheppard. “You think she did that on purpose?” They stared at each other. “Huh,” Sheppard commented.
~ Antarctica. Rodney squeezed his eyes shut and leaned his head back against the cool marble wall of the building behind him, because screaming “fuck!” and running around the tables in the little cafe area wasn’t an option, and there was no one he could punch without getting arrested.
~ “It is exile, and an insult. O’Neill explained it very clearly -- for him.” She tugged on the floppy BDU hat she was still wearing. “And then he told me all will be well, and gave me this hat.” Rodney buried his face in his hands. “Everybody we depend on for survival is insane.” “This is true,” Teyla agreed soberly. Sheppard wandered up, a box from the toy store tucked under his arm. He tipped his sunglasses down to eye them suspiciously. “What?” Impulsively, Rodney said, “You could always resign and come back as a civilian consultant.” Sheppard lifted his brows. “And undermine whoever they send as CO?” Rodney brightened. “Yes! Yes, exactly.” Teyla nodded hopefully.
~ It was evening before they made it back to their hotel, or, as Rodney was beginning to think of it, that big place attached to their bar. But this time he had a plan. He waited until Sheppard had put away enough to be marginally tractable, then waved a beer in front of him. “They can send these to our room. Our comfortable, quiet room? It even has a TV. You like those, don’t you? They have lots of channels, and you don’t have to spend more than ten seconds on any of them. Come on, come on, follow the beer.”
~ The chef looked doubtfully at Sheppard, which must be the standard reaction to hearing that the military had anything to do with him or vice versa, because Sheppard smiled blandly and said, “Air Force.”
~ “He said they were decent.” O’Neill turned to look at Rodney. His brows lifted. “He lied.”
~ But Ronon, who was already frowning, frowned more and said, “I thought Teyla was second in command.” John didn’t need to be reminded that the flow chart for the command structure of Atlantis currently looked like the subway map of New York.
~ “Uh...” John was just beginning to process what had happened, and he wanted to have his freakout in private. “I don’t remember.”
~ Carter rubbed her face, shook her head, then looked at Rodney. After a long moment, she asked, “Are you eating instant coffee?” Rodney, emptying the little packet out into his palm, didn’t even look defensive. “Yes. It’s the quickest way to get it into my bloodstream.” They stared at each other. He asked impatiently, “Do you want some?” She blinked. “Sure.” He tossed her a packet. Ripping it open, she muttered, “And to think, I used to be considered the sane one.”
~ Rodney began, “It’s a long story--” Carter broke in, “I’m your duplicate from another reality. An accident trapped a large group of our people in this reality, and we have to reverse the process so we can all get back. We’ve got some supplies and weapons we can leave with you, and I can give you a list of gate addresses the Goa’uld don’t have, so you should be okay. But while you’re here...mind giving us a hand?” “Oh.” Other Carter blinked, and nodded. “Sure.” John looked at Rodney. “It’s only a long story when you tell it.”
~ John froze. “What? Now? We’re not-- It’s--” He looked down at himself, then around. He wasn’t the only expedition member using underwear as a bathing suit. It just wasn’t an article of clothing most people had thought about while packing for another galaxy. “Elizabeth, I’m not even wearing any pants.”
~
“The surprise inspection? Um, someone must have let it slip to Jack that there was a party today,” Jackson admitted reluctantly. “That...may have been me.”  Halling looked incredulous. “That is the only reason?”  “It’s probably eighty to eighty-five percent the reason.”
~ Bates, the bastard, had found a pair of pants somewhere.
~ Apparently the General had stepped into a room in the Ancient ruin they had been exploring, and it had turned out to be a transporter to another planet. And apparently it had only had enough power left for one more trip, because they hadn’t detected any energy signatures and O’Neill hadn’t been able to use it to get back. (“Yes, that’s pretty much what I expected,” Dr. Jackson said.) At first O’Neill hadn’t realized he was on a different planet, and wasted time looking for them, then looking for the gate. He finally found a local tribe (“This story is going to end with ‘and then they made me their chief,’ isn’t it?” Rodney interrupted.) who had shown him where the gate was.
~ The man was wearing a borrowed tan uniform and a pair of glasses, and he did sort of look like a scientist. A scientist who worked out a lot, and had a gold thingy on his forehead. “Oh no, she sent...Dr. Teal’c.”  Teal’c inclined his head in greeting and said, “Indeed.” Then he picked up the nearest guard and started using him to hit the others. By the time John had knocked the chair over and wriggled out of his bonds, Teal’c had gotten a gun and shot the last few stragglers.
~ Rodney landed on the deck beside him, dumping out the medical kit and scrambling for the packs of bandages. He snarled, “Why do we always forget that when someone says ‘friendly simple people who like to trade’ what they actually mean is ‘a band of psychotic murderers who shoot on sight.’ Damnit, where’s the—”
~ John set his jaw as Rodney and Teyla did something that sent spikes up agony all the way up his spine, and said calmly, “Somebody fucking report right fucking now.”
~ John froze, Rodney made a startled noise, and Teyla actually flinched backward and stepped on Ford.
~ Rodney stared at Everon uncertainly, then around at the room. “So Ford was right, he is crazy.”
“Rodney, could you yell that a little louder?” John asked in exasperation. “Let’s not antagonize the all-powerful being who’s a little confused right now, okay?”
~ Hell was being trapped in a small spaceship with people who wanted to play word games. “Frank Sinatra,” Sheppard said. Of course, Sheppard was playing too because when he wasn’t being a ruthless killer, he was just that big a dork.
~ “But he’s fine. See.” He drew his foot back and planted his boot firmly in the other Marine’s ribs. The subsequent explosion of movement and profanity made Simpson and Miko yelp and Rodney dance hurriedly out of the way of flailing limbs. “Hey, settle down back there.” Sheppard leaned out of the pilot seat to look into the back. “Don’t make me turn this thing around.” Teyla, asleep on the bench, sat up and blinked. “Are we there yet?” It took half an hour to explain to her why everybody had laughed.
~
“A fear of heights is illogical. A fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary.”
~
“You needed human blood to look like a human,” John persisted, “Do you kill people to get it?”
“Yes, the people of Enar are so abysmally stupid that they never noticed the pile of dead bodies outside my house—”
“Just answer the simple, vitally important question,” Rodney grated out the words.  Liam did an eye-rolling thing that in that alien face was truly frightening. “I only need a tiny sample. And I don’t use blood as a source of human genetic material anyway.” “Then what do you use?” Rodney asked pointedly. Liam huffed. “Let’s think. What’s the best possible source of human genetic material that is endlessly renewable, painlessly obtainable, and makes you a lot of friends?” John felt his jaw drop. Rodney winced, waving his free hand in the universal sign for too much information. 
“Oh, my God. That’s disgusting enough to be true.”
~
“I kind of miss Steve.” Sheppard sounded reminiscent.
“Steve who?” Rodney frowned. “Steve, the operations staff tech? What happened to him?”
“No.” Sheppard gave him a patient look. “Steve the Wraith.” Rodney grimaced in disgust. “You’re a very sick man. That should frighten me, but somehow I find it comforting. And that’s what frightens me the most.” “We didn’t mean to kill him,” Sheppard protested, not convincingly.  Rodney nodded seriously. “Yes, using him in that medical experiment was a complete fluke.”  Sheppard gave him the patently fake earnest look that had probably driven many past commanding officers a little closer to the edge. “He would have wanted to go out that way. You know, being useful.” Rodney sneered, “Well, one day maybe we’ll capture another Wraith for you to taunt while it slowly starves to death.” Sheppard sighed. “Promises, promises.”
“Steve is dead,” Ford said solemnly. Then he added, “He is an ex-Wraith.” Sheppard made a noise somewhere between a snort and a cough. “Don’t.” Ford was quiet for thirty seconds. Then he said, “He is a late Wraith.” Rodney added maliciously, “Maybe he’s resting. Norwegian Blues stun easily.” Ford lifted his brows. “Pining. He’s pining for the fjords.” “Stop,” Sheppard choked.
“Bereft of life, he rests in peace,” Simpson said from the back. It went on until the jumper started increasing the oxygen mix because it thought Sheppard was asphyxiating and Teyla threatened to lock herself in the head.

“It got blown up trying to fight off the last big Wraith culling, years and years ago, and now if anyone tries to live in it their skin falls off.”
