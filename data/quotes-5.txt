“The Library. So big it doesn’t need a name; just a great big ‘the’.”

“Ooh, closed door. Must be serious.”
“I have reason to believe that someone in our department is working for Jimmy Nichols.”
“Nichols? The man responsible for blowing up half the east side? Good call on the door.”
~
“I’ll tell you what then, don’t step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you anyway?”
“What if…I don’t know…what if I kill my grandfather?”
“Are you planning to?”
“No.”
“Well, then.”
~
“I love old things. They make me feel sad.”
“What’s so good about sad?”
“It’s happy for deep people.”
~ “Tracked you down with this. This is my timey-wimey detector. It goes ding when there’s stuff. Also, it can boil an egg at 30 paces, whether you want it to or not, actually, so I’ve learned to stay away from hens. It’s not pretty when they blow.”

“Oh that’s no good. What if you get defeated? “Staal The Not-Quite-So-Undefeated-Any-More-But-Never-Mind?””
~ “You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up “genocide”. You’ll find a little picture of me there, and the caption will read “Over my dead body”.”
~ There’s a fountain in the centre of the room under a domed skylight; the bellhops are wearing crisp white shirts and neatly pressed vests and the woman behind the front desk is watching him and Dean with an expression of deep suspicion that’s mirrored almost perfectly on Dean’s face. Sam gives her his most disarming smile and shifts closer to his brother, who’s clutching the strap of his battered duffel and glaring at the fountain like it’s about to attack him. “Hey. Relax.”
~
“Have I mentioned lately how much I hate old hotels?” Dean grumbles, kicking a cardboard box out of his way in a puff of dust.  “Yeah, you have,” he says back. “Focus.”
“I hate old hotels,” Dean repeats. “Freaking dust everywhere.”
“At least there aren’t rats?” Sam offers. It’s too dark for him to see Dean’s expression, but he doesn’t really need to.
~
“What I don’t get,” he says, dropping a match into the grave “is why I’m always the one who gets tossed around and bashed in the head.” “She tried to choke me,” Sam offers, zipping up the bag and shouldering it.
Dean doesn’t look mollified. “This job blows,” he says, handing the shovel over and holstering his shotgun. There’s blood trickling out of his hair, but when Sam shines the flashlight in his face, his eyes dilate properly. “Hey! Next time, warn a guy.”
~ “If I’d wanted you dead, I wouldn’t use your food,” she tells him, because it’s true. Simon chokes, and Mal laughs, and Zoë says, “Eat your damn food, Jayne, or I’ll take it,” which gets the job done.
~
Joanna’s cries shatter glass when they drop her off at day-care for the first time. McCoy’s a heartless bastard, but Joss has to physically drag him back to the car once the screaming starts. She tells him repeatedly that the separation is necessary, that they have to start teaching Jo to be comfortable without them.
“Do you want her to still be living with us when she’s forty?”
“Yes,” he grumbles, sullen at the sight of her smirk. She shakes her head and leans over to kiss his cheek fondly, and when she drops him at the hospital she leaves firm instructions not to go back for their daughter, no matter how badly he wants to.
~
He stumbles blearily to the receiver and snaps, “What?” into it, only retroactively realizing that it might be his mother, and Christ is he never going to hear the end of this if it is.
~
McCoy is never quite sure how Jim managed to trick him into being roommates. He’s pretty sure that conversation had started with him very emphatically stating that he didn’t foresee that combination culminating in anything other than bloody death, probably Jim’s but maybe his own, and somehow it ended with Jim’s stuff taking over half of the closet and his socks on the bedposts.
~
He crouches over the fallen student and growls in a voice so low it could make a dog whimper, “You listen to me, you son of a bitch. You are going to wake him up and pay him in full and let him go right fucking now or I swear to God I’m going to perform an emergency brain surgery on you using only my fists and the corner of your clipboard, y’hear?”
~ There are three rules of Sick Bay:
1. Do as you’re fucking told (Jim Kirk).
2. Don’t harass his nurses (Jim Kirk), because McCoy will find out and he will kill you.
3. Don’t get injured in the first place, you shipload of morons.
~
“You’re like, the worst stalker ever,” Jim says as he’s opening his door and McCoy comes up behind him. “You didn’t even pretend to be going somewhere else.” McCoy shrugs and Jim lets him inside and pours him a class of bourbon.
~ Joanna gets engaged on September 5th. McCoy tries not to freak out and fails spectacularly. Of course Jim is bouncing around the restaurant like a fucking puppy, practically slobbering over Joanna’s stupid fiancé, asking questions like, “What’s your name?” and “Where do you work?” Who the fuck cares, McCoy wonders, ripping his napkin into little tiny pieces. It’s obvious that it’s not true love. Joanna’s a baby. She’s not old enough for true love. Fuck if she’s not still ten, is she not still ten? Didn’t he drop of her off at day care, like, two hours ago? By the time their entrées arrive, he’s shredded his napkin and Jim’s so he excuses himself to the bathroom. When he gets back, Joanna’s gone outside to take a call from her mother, so it’s just Jim and the man whose name McCoy still hasn’t processed. Jim has a wide smile on his face, so McCoy expects them to be talking about how much they just love each other and can’t wait to be family, but when he gets into earshot he hears: “… hurt Joanna, I will slowly and cheerfully rip the skin off of your body, do you understand?” McCoy’s not sure he’s ever loved him so much.
~
“Thanks for giving me an excuse to leave, but next time, you can just pretend to hurt yourself, okay?”
~
“Yeah?” Dean raised an eyebrow. “You do realize which side of the gun you’re standing on, right?”
~
“A ‘frillion,’” Sheldon tells her, “is not a number.”
~
“Mmhm, I see,” Sheldon says, in what is clearly a humouring the crazy person voice.
~
“The woman I could potentially fall in love with, should she ever bother to notice I exist.” Wash amended.
~
“I take it you’re not expecting anyone?” Bill asked, dabbing half-heartedly at the puddle on the table.  “Dad took Harry to the battery shop, and Hermione and Ginny are at that girl...party...thing.” Fred snorted. “And that exhausts your list of potential social callers?”
~
“Not even: I hired somebody to hire a designer to do it. I’m like two-steps removed from the place, maybe more. I have major plausible deniability regarding my own decor, which, frankly,” Josh admitted, “I might not even be able to identify in a line-up.” He closed his eyes and seemed to think hard. “Like I have absolutely no idea what colour my towels are.”
~ There was but one way to bring the full weight of my disapproval upon Jeeves’ consciousness. “Beginning tomorrow—I am re-growing my moustache.”  This made an impression on the man. His lips pressed together as if clamped. But his only response was, “Very good, sir.” […]
There was but one way to share the full warmth of my approval. “You may disregard all I have said about the return of the moustache.”  Jeeves smiled—again, sort of invisibly, but still it was a smile. I’d bet a fiver. “Thank you, sir.”
~ “Man,” Booth says, “you’re the hard-ass colonel they were trying to scare us with back at the SGC?” “You’re the best and the brightest they’re supposed to be sending me?” John’s pretty sure from the ache in his cheeks that his grin is as wide as Booth’s.  “Jackass,” Booth says.  “Asshole.” There’s probably some regulation somewhere that forbids a colonel from getting into a mock fist-fight with a major in full view of curious Marines, so John settles for punching Booth lightly in the shoulder.
~ “It’s really me. Hallucinations don’t wipe the puke off your face.”
~
“Besides, this is Jim we’re talking about here—he joined Starfleet by getting in a fight. Either he’s dead or he needs a doctor, and I don’t think you want to go through all the trouble of disobeying a direct order to find he needs medical attention that you aren’t qualified to give him.” Spock considers this, and the stubborn edge to McCoy’s face. 
“Your arguments are compelling. I assume you are familiar with how to use a phaser?” “I’m a doctor, not a moron.”
~
“I don’t suppose you know exactly where we’re going,” says McCoy.  “Unfortunately, Captain Kirk neglected to send us the precise coordinates of his cell when he was forcibly kidnapped,” Spock replies.
~ “I am aware of that as well,” says Spock levelly. “However, I will be faster than them.” He sets his phaser to stun, and then adds, “Or we will die. That is also a distinct possibility.”
~ “I believe now is the appropriate time to enact Captain Kirk’s orders,” Spock says, his voice strained.  “Right, sir,” says Sulu. “Getting us the hell out of here, sir.”
~ He frowns and turns his head away from the likely path of the projectile, attempting to mutter “Please desist this behaviour,” which comes out more as “Pmph.”
~ Spock gave him a look. “Fine has too many variable definitions to be used as an accurate assessment of your condition.”
~
“... Except for Sterling,” Alec hears himself say, and then winces and thinks, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Z as Nate turns to glare at him.
~ “I’m fine, Peter,” Caffrey says. “She wasn’t going to use it on me.”
“I might’ve,” Parker grumbles. Alec makes a hissing STFU noise at her, then straightens his arms reflexively as the muzzle of the gun twitches in his direction. Last thing he really needs is a bonus charge of back-talking while black.
~
Burke does that thing cops do where they kind of glance back at someone without actually looking away from the targets in front of them. “They did hack your anklet, Neal— which, for those of you in the peanut gallery, is felony number four by my count so far. But they didn’t get the tracker in your cell phone, and that, they left in their van outside.”
Nate, Parker, and Eliot all turn to glare at Alec. “Dude!” Alec protests, glaring back. “Tracking anklet. It’s called the Federal Bureau of Investigation, not the Federal Bureau of Redundancy Department. How was I supposed to know?”
~
“If I weren’t a cop, I’d shoot him in a dark alley and leave evidence that his own people were behind it…and, when I say ‘I’, I mean a hypothetical, fictional detective who’d be played by George Clooney.”

“Let’s hug it out.”
“I’d rather fall in love with a vegan.”

“Don’t take my silence as confusion. I was just trying to kill you with my mind.”

“Mucking out the stables? Really. That’s strange because a little bird told me you were somewhere else.”
“Mucking out the stables is strange but a talking bird isn’t.”
“Merlin, what have we said about you trying to be funny?”

“I’ve no doubt you’ve got a very good explanation for this.”
“Yes! No! Wait—”
“Apparently I was wrong.”

“I tend to use pictures of things I want to do as my desktop background: travel to Ireland, go see Tangled…”
“Oh, I use my background the same way. Right now, it’s Andrew Garfield.”

“Who’s the dad?”
“We’ll know when the baby comes out. Depends on if it’s white or black or Chinese …or French.”
“Guess he’s not around then and you’re all alone in the world…apart from the living organism growing inside you?”
~
“When the time comes, you will know how to find me.”
“Well, if I don’t show up, it’ll probably because I don’t know where I’m going.”
~
“We’re going to need a fire extinguisher to put out…the corpse. Then, maybe some sort of trauma counsellor.”
~
“Do you recognise this? Apparently I made it last night in my sleep. I used gindronac; highly unstable. I put a button on it. I wish to press it but I’m not sure what will happen if I do…”
~
“I’m not taking your money, Eliot,” she replies instantly.
He gives her a look she’s gotten used to over the past nine years, one that says he loves her and that she’s an idiot. “It’s not my money, darlin’,” he tells her, reaching across the table to take her hand and run his thumb over his ring. “This ring? Means it’s our money.”
~
When she asks, he laughingly tells her that he fought the law and the law cried like a baby when he was done with it, which she assumes is a joke until the news starts talking about a military coup in Azerbaijan.
~
Mal had responded that he most certainly did not mope. He was just… marking a day. With a drink. And if he could plant his fist in someone’s face—hey, that’d just be the bonus.
~
“Don’t worry, my policy is not to shoplift when my friends can’t spare bail money.”

“If I had to choose, I would die execution-style by firing squad.”
“First of all, nobody’s asking you to choose. And secondly, why that? It’s brutal and violent.”
“I know. But I would choose all of my shooters personally. George Carlin. Abbot…or Costello, whichever was the fat one. Laurel and Hardy. All the comedy greats. Think of how funny that would be.”
“It wouldn’t be. You’d be dead.”
“Why do you have to take it to such a dark place?”
~
“I don’t understand a word you’re saying, but I know what you’re going on about and I refuse to apologise.”
~
“You know we were never really trying to kill you. Only trying to scare you into surrendering…”
“Well, that’s one way to explain why you can’t seem to shoot straight.”
~
“Yes, I’m wearing make up. It’s part of my new self-esteem class. Do you think I look pretty?”
“Depends. How far along are you in the class?”
~
“How do I feel? Let’s see. Closure. Indifference. Hunger.”
“Wow, you’re like a robot.”
“Thank you. I got the same comment on my eHarmony page, so it must be true.”
~
“This flashy panel is the key to saving the ship or I’d eat my hat…if I had a hat. I’d eat someone’s hat…as long as they’re not using their hat…sorry, rambling.”

“Found it on an old drive. Sorry about the quality; had to recover the data using quantum enfolding and a paper clip.”
~
“What’s so special about me? Have you ever seen Mary Poppins?”
“No?”
“Good, because that comparison would have been rubbish.”
~
“I’ve never kissed anyone before. What do I do?”
“Well, try to be all nervous and rubbish at it. You’re going to be anyway, so it might as well be part of the plan.”
~
He circled the kissing pair, curious. “How do you keep going like that? Do you breathe out your ears?”
~ “I can’t think of a better place to spend the apocalypse than Massachusetts, where the air is tinged with wood smoke, survivalism, and the sneaking suspicion that, whatever it is we’ve got coming, we probably deserve it. This is what I remember from last time, anyway.”
~
“Oh, uh, hello!” she said. Very eloquent. Good start. She rolled her eyes at herself internally.  Mark, understandably, looked puzzled. His eyes kept flicking from one side of her face to the other, and then to the shopping bags. As though he felt he ought to be able to puzzle out what was happening just by observing what was in front of him, and was confused as to why he couldn’t.  Well, say something, Juliet had to remind herself. This was all already proving to be more complicated than she’d hoped.
~
“So,” David said when she’d finished, “he left the country before I could kick his ass.”
“David, I’ve seen you fight. It’s not pretty.”
Pretending she hadn’t spoken, David continued, “You three are always welcome to move in here with me.”
~
“Stella. You know, like ‘Steeellaaaa!’” She took in their blank stares. “I’d pretend to tear off my shirt, but my hands are kind of full here.”
“That would in no way clarify what you’re referencing,” Sheldon said.

He tries in vain to come up with a loophole wherein he can incarcerate the kid for being a wiseass but, to his chagrin, can find none. Unfortunately, there’s no law against smarminess.
~
Batman looked at him.  Flash reminded himself that Batman probably wouldn’t drop him off a roof.  Supes and Diana would veto that.  Or at least catch him or something. 
~
Flash was kind of terrified of Batman.  Which was the completely normal response to a guy like Bats.  Superman and Diana weren’t scared by his whole “I am the night” thing, but that only proved you had to be Superman or Wonder Woman not to find Batman scary.
Not that he ever actually mentioned this to anyone.  It’d be like admitting you were afraid of the dark—or of the dark because there was a good chance 220 pounds of crazy guy dressed like one of nature’s creepier mammals was going to land on you.
And it wasn’t exactly a bad thing.  Being completely terrifying even in broad daylight—actually extra terrifying because Bats managed to get extra cranky when he hadn’t slept in a few days—was like Batman’s super power.  Well, that and not tripping over his cape or getting it stuck in doors and stuff. 
If he had to choose, Flash would probably have gone with being able to wear a cape.  Capes looked awesome—it was just the wind resistance and getting caught in things and possibly strangling aspect that was a problem.  Or getting sucked into a jet engine even though Flash didn’t have to worry about that, and Superman said that never happened.  Everybody knew Superman didn’t lie, and when he and Batman stood there with their capes billowing majestically in the wind (because they knew the secret to standing in just the right place so your cape billowed majestically behind you instead of hitting you in the face) you’d believe anything.  It was just the most superheroic thing ever.  Even if 90% of the superhero community didn’t wear capes because they were impractical and a total pain in the butt and usually just made you look stupid.
~
“You want me to break your arm,” said Batman.
“No,” said Flash. “But I think I messed it up, so it’s not healing right. And John’s somewhere in the Delta Quadrant doing Green Lantern stuff, and everybody else has super-strength. I mean, I’d try it, but I’m pretty sure I might puke. And pass out.” He decided not to mention that by “pretty sure” he meant that had happened once.
~
“It’s an instrument of God,” Indy said, with some exasperation. “Put it down, please.”
~
David’s given up trying to decide if Jumba has a bad imitation of a Russian accent because that’s where he learned to speak English, or if it’s just that the accent his language gives English happens to sound like a bad Russian accent, or if it’s some kind of wonky universal translator thing. He supposes he could ask, but at this point, his life is weird enough.
~ “Lilo,” Nani says, all groggy from sleep and refusing to open her eyes, “didn’t you read what I said about waking me up?”
“You can’t feed me to the dog, Stitch wouldn’t eat me,” Lilo replies, unconcerned. “I have a question.”
“You always have a question, Lilo,” Nani points out, still not opening her eyes.
“Yeah, but this one’s important. I kind of need to know. So I’ll know what to do next.”
Nani cracks an eye open. “I’m not sure I like the sound of that. Okay, Lilo, what’s your question?”
“If David asked you to marry him,” Lilo asks, very seriously, “would you say yes, or no? And would how big the ring is make any difference? Or if it could set things on fire?”
Nani’s other eye opens, and she seems to take a minute to focus. “First of all,” she says, “do not, under any circumstances, make a ring that light things on fire, or anything like that. Do you hear me, Lilo? No, I want you to say it out loud.”
~
“You two took long enough,” he adds, shooting them a glare before smiling warmly and cooing down at Elizabeth.
“You know, you lose some of that whole ‘tough-guy’ thing when you do that,” Chuck says. Casey stalwartly ignores him.
“I might have to kill your daddy,” Casey sing-songs to Elizabeth. She tries to clap her hands, and half-gurgles with a smile. “She doesn’t seem to mind,” Casey says to Chuck.
~
“How do you run in those heels?” Chuck hisses. “And where were you hiding that gun?”
Sarah grins at him. “Practice,” she says, “And that,” she says, “I’ll tell you later.”
~
“That’s Froydins,” Shawn said, suddenly adopting a vaguely German, possibly Dutch, accent. He drew a U in the air, crowned with two stabbed dots. “With the, how you say? Ze heimlich.”
“Umlaut,” Gus muttered.
“Gesundheit,” Shawn said.
~
Shawn took great delight in the word. “Dander,” he said, chuckling, as they left the office. “Dander. Why, you’re in fine dander today, my good sir! Oh, thank you, you’re looking quite dandery yourself.” Gus checked his watch and groaned when he saw the time. “What?” Shawn asked. “Is it your dander? Can I dander you? Don’t be dandered, Gus.”
~
Shawn hurried to keep up with Gus. “Proctologist? Masseuse? Urologist? Uranus? Ha, I said anus. Um, IRS? Exterminator? Do you have bedbugs, Gus? You can tell me. From a safe distance, of course, while wearing a hazmat suit, which, incidentally, would really set off your soulful eyes. No? No exterminator? Well, that’s good, I suppose. Hmmm.” He pursed his lips and tapped one fingers against his chin. Gus started walking again, quickening his pace even more. “Is it...come on, brain, think, no whammies, think. Anaesthesiologist?”
Gus stopped short and Shawn banged into him. “Why would an anaesthesiologist be a private matter?”
“I don’t know!” Shawn spread his arms wide and raised his voice. “You’re the one with all the secrets! You tell me!”
~
“Need a Kleenex?” Nightwing asked, producing a little travel pack of them out of somewhere. Jason had yet to figure out how the guy carried anything on him, considering that his costume was skin-tight and he apparently had something against the Bat-standard utility belt.
Jason eyed him suspiciously. “Why are you being so nice to me?”
Nightwing shrugged. “How about we make a deal— I’ll give you the Kleenex if you agree not to hold a gun on me this time. Call me crazy, but the idea of a guy who’s sneezing violently pointing a gun at my head tends to make me a little nervous.”
~
That creepy new Batgirl appeared out of nowhere (scaring five years off his life, swear to god) and handed him a package of Vitamin C tablets and zinc lozenges. He ran an analysis on the damn things, and they weren’t even drugged. Oracle broke into his secure communications channel and, sounding about as put-upon and pissy as a computer-distorted voice could sound, interrogated him for several minutes about his symptoms and whether he’d been drinking enough fluids and getting proper nutrition and rest. Jason was almost certain that he hadn’t hallucinated that one, but admittedly his fever was spiking pretty high at that point.
~
(Okay, so it wasn’t so much a “lair” as a crappy apartment in a bad part of town, but his last lair had gotten blown up and he hadn’t gotten around to setting up a new one yet.)
~
“The record keeper wouldn’t let me look, he said it was protected information, and I said, please show me, she’s my friend and I’m trying to find her, but he wouldn’t help me. So I offered to have sex with him if he would.” “And you did?” Nyota asks, not because this is the most important part of the story. Gaila shakes her head. “No, I just left him tied to his desk. It’s okay, I think his supervisor will have found him by now. I took a shuttle.”
~
Sometimes Castle wondered what other people’s lives must be like. Did they get nervous? Or doubt their own epic genius? Cause these weren’t really problems that he had.
~
“Christmas laser tag!” Castle repeated excitedly. “Like regular laser tag, but even more awesome in its festivity.”
“You two do realize I’m the only one here who actually knows how to shoot a gun,” Kate said, rising to her feet and pulling her hair back in a low ponytail.
“Yeah, sure,” Alexis said, returning with laser packs. “But I think you’re underestimating how seriously boss I am at laser tag.”
~
“Try to scowl less; it’ll make it sound more believable when you tell me you’re not jealous.”
~
The field hospital had sixty beds, and every one of them was full, which meant that his bandages—heavy and dark with blood again, already—would be changed between When I Get a Minute o’clock and You Have All Your Limbs So Shut Up thirty.
~
Audrey made some kind of sighing, squeaking noise that made Nathan smile. “Have I told you lately that you’re the best partner ever?”
“Aren’t I the only partner you’ve had?”
“That’s only because I was waiting for the perfect one,” Audrey insisted, taking a bite of her sandwich.
~
Note to self: add ‘jumping over things’ to daily running regimen.
~
George came roaring out the door, whooping like a fool, pointing and laughing at me laying on the floor beneath the knee of an airport security officer. Funny thing, George, airport security is even less likely to let a man hovering in the air on a set of faerie wings leave the premises without an interrogation. At least all I’d done was wield a big stick.
~
Tobias was glaring at me from under thickly beetled brows, the thundercloud expression on his face suggesting that he blamed me personally for the hospital bed he was lying in, the cast on his leg, world hunger and probably cancer. And he’d just admitted to being piledriven down a flight of stairs by a waterfowl. My stunning sense of tact informed me that this was perhaps not the best time to make a joke. I swallowed the first half dozen things that came to mind and managed an impeccably witty, “Oh. Okay then,” instead.
~
“I’ll see what I can do,” I promised, knowing even as I said it that it was a monumentally stupid thing to do. Emma brightened and Thomas rolled his eyes at me behind her back. I figured I deserved both responses.
~
“You know,” said Thomas thoughtfully. “I’m beginning to think this magic stuff isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.”
“You’re just jealous that you can’t blow stuff up with your mind,” I shot back. The crystal gave a half-hearted wobble to the side and I made a face at it.
~
“Can you take care of the coffee shop?” I asked. “I’ll find out what else it’s pointing to while you,” I made a gesture meant to convey ‘stand around and be ridiculously good looking while people fall in your lap’. Judging by the expression on Thomas’ face, it probably lost something in translation.
~
He flashed me a Hollywood smile, bright and flawlessly white. The gaggle of women at the door sighed like the heroines of one of Bob’s bodice rippers and, somewhere behind me, I heard the unique yet utterly unmistakable sound of someone on a bicycle ploughing straight into a lamppost. I refrained from rubbernecking over my shoulder to check the damage and rolled my eyes at Thomas instead. “Put that away before someone gets hurt,” I told him.
~
The crystal jerked with an odd hooking motion and I took an absent step around the corner into another alley. And came face to snout with a lion. The thinking part of my brain got about as far as ‘Hell’s bells, that’s a lion’ before it hit a mental brick wall and started grinding gears. My animal brain just flailed uselessly and started whimpering in sheer, unmitigated terror. The rest of me stood there like an idiot, absently cataloguing the damp-fur smell of the thing’s dark brown coat, its heavy mane and a jaw full of really, really big teeth like there was going to be a quiz later. Then the lion growled, a low, terrifying sound accompanied by a lip curl that neatly showcased the aforementioned teeth, and I turned on my heel and ran like hell.
~
“Is your life always this weird?”
“Nah. Sometimes people try to kill me too.” 
~
“Your lack of faith in me is astounding,” I told him solemnly.
“Hear that?” Thomas asked. “That’s the sound of me rolling my eyes at you. Just so you know.”
~
Unluckily for me, there wasn’t a whole lot I could accomplish from the inside of a closet, especially since my kaboom magic usually came with side-effects like third degree burns and missing body parts when used in small spaces.
~
“I thought you said you could take care of it,” Thomas said, in a tone of voice that suggested he was laughing at my pain.
“I’m a chronic liar.” There was dawn-light leaking in around Thomas’ silhouette which meant it had to be close to seven; apparently I’d fallen asleep while I wasn’t looking. How professional. “How’d you find me?”
Thomas rolled his eyes. “Oh, I don’t know Harry, our close family bond?” He stepped back to let me out of the closet, which sounded like the beginning of far too many gay jokes for me to even want to go there. I noticed the veritable army of red-hatted lawn ornaments clustered around the door at the same time as Thomas said, “or maybe it was the ten thousand garden gnomes in the hallway.”
~
“You know, you seemed a lot more impressive before I knew just how much of this stuff you make up.”
“It’s the sense of mystique,” I agreed and pushed open the bedroom door without any hint of subtlety. “Hand me the pizza, could you?”
“If you get us killed by pucas I’m going to be very upset with you,” Thomas said, passing over the still-warm box.
“Duly noted. Hey pucas!” I said to the room, which looked unexpectedly frilly for belonging to a puca-summoning pagan. Of course, considering that Emma got her inspiration for said summoning from a nursery rhyme, all the pink really shouldn’t have been all that surprising. “I brought you a present!”
Thomas was shaking his head at me. “How do you ever take yourself seriously?”
“I don’t,” I answered. “I would’ve thought you’d noticed by now. I’m going to put this down on the bed,” I told the as of yet unseen pucas. “I just want to talk.” I put the pizza box down and backed off, not really all that sure this was going to work. I mean, pizza was definitely the way to some fairies’ hearts, just ask my friend Toot Toot, but I’d never had much actual experience with pucas before. For all I knew, they were lactose intolerant. Which would have been awkward.
~
They intercepted Arthur and Merlin as they were leaving the castle. Merlin was carrying what had to be his own bodyweight in weaponry. Arthur was carrying nothing and admonishing Merlin for being too slow.
~
“We’re not with you,” replied Morgana. “We’re just strolling in this general direction. Aren’t we, Gwen?” Gwen’s dress snagged on a branch for the third time in as many minutes and she muttered something that definitely wasn’t “yes, my lady” under her breath.
Merlin asked, “Why are you two along, anyway?”
“Oh, Morgana had a dream about Arthur being eaten by bears.”
Merlin attempted to rearrange Arthur’s various weapons in his arms. “I have that one all the time.”
~
“I called God a bad name,” Castiel murmurs.
“He was asking for it,” Dean says.
“I really don’t think He minds,” Sam adds. “He’s big enough to handle it.”

“New friends? Oh, you mean Misty and,” he snaps his fingers a few times, then gives up. “The other one?”
~ “Emma, goddess of my heart, won’t you please do me the very great honour of becoming my wife and finally making an honest man of me?” He declaims. Tony’s never declaimed before, but that’s definitely what that was, declaiming. Normally he’d be a little worried she’d take him up on it, but this is Emma. The only thing she hates more than making a scene is making a commitment.
~
He doesn’t realize he’s staring until Michael walks by and flicks him on the back of the head, and he spends the next half-hour upset that he owes Michael a favour. Then Dwight shows up in a shiny short-sleeve turtleneck with little holograms on it, and it’s hard to be upset when something so wordlessly awesome exists in the world.

Tony calls Rhodey because he’s already called Pepper twice this week, and the second time she came over, Tony could see that murderous gleam in her eye that he’s only seen in women he’s had escorted from the premises by guards. The thing about Rhodey, though, is that seeing Tony naked doesn’t faze him. Rhodey sees naked men every day. Sometimes Tony thinks he should’ve joined the military just for all the skin, and then he remembers he can see all the naked people he wants, whenever he wants, for free: that’s what youporn.com is for.
~ He’s always liked drinking a bit too much, and after the whole business with Obadiah, well, it only gets worse. He’s only semi-conscious about it, of the way Rhodey stops taking him out for drinks and starts showing up in his place with pizza instead; of the way his decade old scotch bottles start disappearing and how both Pepper and Jarvis claim they know nothing about it. Pepper, incidentally, is the better liar.  “I’m a big boy, damn it,” he says as he comes home with a new bottle, and Pepper pointedly says nothing but leaves him passed out at his working table instead of dragging him up to his bed as usual and then refuses to tell him where the painkillers are the next morning in retaliation.  “You’re a big boy, you figure it out,” she says, and clicks her heels extra loudly all day long.
~
Every so often, Pepper reviews her list, when she’s exhausted, when she’s shaken from watching Tony soar through unknown skies on shaky guerrilla news footage. She always firmly caps it with: Except I will never sleep with my boss, no matter the reason, because that would be Stupid. It would end in Disaster. And he would probably film it and it would get leaked and my Career would be Over. She makes sure to capitalize certain words in her mind, underscoring their importance, reminding herself time and again that having sex with Tony Stark would be a really terrible idea.
~
Teela shrugged. “You’re male. Father says you’ll keep maturing and mentally catch up with me in a few years. In the meantime, you’re an idiot. It just works that way.”
~
She blinks again, about three times. “You’re wooing me?” “Yes. I thought it was quite obvious.” “No,” she says, shaking her head. “No, it’s hasn’t been, because I’ve been helping you woo women for the better part of the past few years, and this is not how you woo women. You send them lavish gifts and buy them dresses and once you bought someone a car.” He nods slowly. “Yes, but I’m not wooing women right now, Pepper. I’m wooing you. This is a Pepper-specific wooing.” He waves a hand expansively. “Those were just women,” he says. “This is you.”

“If it wasn’t for my dust allergy and crippling claustrophobia, you know I’d be right there with you.”

“Oh, and happy Christmas, Mr. Chance.”
“Merry. We say merry Christmas.”
“I know. It just sounds a bit silly.”

“Mom, don’t use the word blog. It embarrasses me for us both.”

“I feel like I owe you an apology. I mean, it’s one thing for me to live my crappy life, but making you do it too is just cruel and unusual.”

“The character is a smart, complicated detective with enormous depth…then the studio goes and casts the braless co-ed in a blood soaked T shirt from Knife II.”
“Well, Knife II made a lot of money, dear. And your books are not exactly Shakespeare.”
“Thank you, mother, but I was hoping to elevate their stature by not casting the chainsaw-wielding hooker from Hallowscream III.”
“Hey, I like that movie…if I’d seen it, which I haven’t,” his daughter backtracked quickly.

“How are you going to pop the question? Hot air balloon? Skywriter? Jumbotron?”
“I thought I’d just ask.”

“I see eight Rolex boxes. The guy’s got two arms and eight Rolexes?”
“Yeah, two arms, eight Rolexes and one safe he didn’t use. Genius.”

“Alright. Nobody panic. I’m in charge here.”
“That’s why we’re panicking.”

He gets up, hoping to god that Isaac’s office isn’t actually locked, because one of the many advantages of being raised upper middle class is never having to learn how to pick a lock. Dan probably knows how to pick a lock. That’s just the kind of scoundrel he is.
~
He’s never had a running joke in his life, a fact he attributes to not keeping people around long enough to develop that kind of familiarity and comfort. And all things considered, he doesn’t think he’s entirely pleased with the fact that the first such joke in his life centres on an unfortunate lack of grenades in situations that might merit explosives.

“Twice a year or so, on her way home from the wine shop down the street, she decides to buy a book for her daughter for her birthday or Christmas or to apologize for their latest row. You sell her whatever book happens to be on the desk at the moment, and it’s always something completely inappropriate for a teenage girl. Last time you sold her a complete set of Dostoyevsky.”
Bernard snatched a piece of toast. “It’s her fault for coming in so early. I’m not awake at this hour.”

Phil looks at Lem, and Lem looks at Phil. Eventually, they will need to break the news about the escape of the Octochicken 2.0. They never should have attempted to get drumsticks and calamari from one animal. But today is not that day.

“But I can’t stay at mine for at least the next couple of days. Ergo, I have nowhere to live. Unless my best friend takes pity on me.” Danny wonders why the universe never takes pity on him; in a just world, Dana would have found them slacking off by now, and killed them both. He glances hopefully at the closed door, and when it shows no signs of bursting open, he says, “Dude, I think it’s really great the way you and Jeremy have gotten so close. He’ll really appreciate the company—and the extra practice time.”  Casey kicks him again. “I don’t even know what that last part means,” he says. “I also don’t care. Couple days, Danny.”
“See, you say that, but a couple days living with you comes in second to an eternity of being stabbed, repeatedly, in the face by a group of crazed, angry children. A close second, you understand. But second, nonetheless.” “That is demonstrably not true,” Casey says. “And I admit, the last time we tried it, we had some teething problems, but that was years ago. We’ve both undergone substantive personal changes since then.” “You’ve probably made lists of them. In a book. An indexed book. An indexed book, in which all even-numbered pages are allocated to you, and odd-numbered ones to me. That, my friend, is the kind of person you are, and you are going to come into my home, and you’re going to make schedules for all the cleaning activities, and an ordered system by which we will choose which TV programs we watch, and you’ll start alphabetising things. And I will wish for death. And death will not come, Casey. Death will purposefully stay away, simply because it, too, is enjoying my pain and suffering.”
~
“We talked about this!” Thomas was lying across my tiny bed, lazy and satisfied and not embarrassed in any way, despite the fact that his only article of clothing was the red and white-striped scarf tying his hands to the bedpost. He shrugged, as much as he was able.
~
“Oh, close your mouth and come inside,” Murphy said, but I knew all Murphy’s tells, and the way she turned away quickly meant she was pleased and didn’t want me to know it. “Also, no. What?” I’d already forgotten what the question I had asked her even was, and as Murphy went to fetch her coat, I closed my eyes and counted to twenty, trying to remember that Murphy and I were just friends and also that my brother was an idiot.  “Something wrong?” she asked, and I opened my eyes to find her fluffing her blond curls over the collar of her coat.  “My brother’s an idiot,” I said out of reflex, and started back over again at one.
~
“But,” I protested, feeling rather deflated, “there was touching! And kissing! I think I accidentally made it to second base!” “As implausible as it sounds, Murphy might actually just like you,” Bob said sympathetically. “What’s second base these days, anyway? Last time I had hands it was getting one of them on a bare ankle.”
~
“No! No, I just thought he...” I stopped myself from actually uttering the words ‘juiced you up for me’ and by the look on Murphy’s face, it was a good choice. “He was talking about me needing to...um...and then he mentioned tiny Dresdens, and then you were talking to him, and I thought the thrall part of him might have...rubbed off on you. A little. But it turns it wouldn’t last that long, so you must have been...you know...on purpose.” “Tiny...” Murphy echoed, and I said “Um” again. Finally Murphy sighed. “Let me get this straight. The reason you fled my company as though I were carrying the plague was because you thought I was overtaken by misplaced vampire lust, and you were only trying to save me from myself?” “Yes!” I said fervently, trying to look chivalrous and penitent. “That’s completely plausible! Trust me, I’m a wizard! It happens all the time!” ~ Peter inviting Neal to spend Christmas with him and Elizabeth wasn’t Peter feeling sorry for Neal; it was just—well, being polite. Keeping Neal out of trouble, perhaps. Peter rolled that phrase around in his mind a few times (‘keeping Neal out of trouble’), decided it didn’t sound too bad, if a little bit unrealistic, and decided to stop thinking about it.
Elizabeth, predictably, loved the gift Neal had gotten them (‘at the last minute’, he claimed, which was such an obvious lie Peter didn’t even bother calling him on it). Their tastes were remarkably alike, with the difference that, of course, Elizabeth didn’t feel any urges to remove her favourite artwork from the museums or homes where they were kept— or, if she did feel such urges, at least was sensible enough not to give in to them.
“Please tell me that’s a fake.” Which wasn’t, Peter knew entirely too well, the same as asking.
“It’s a fake,” Neal said promptly. Obediently, even— with that expression on his face that told Peter he’d gotten exactly what he’d asked for and so, really, he should stop scowling.
~
“No, I’m serious,” he complains over a plate of fried rice, “murder is back on the table. Wolowitz had us watch 1000 Ways to Die. We were inspired. Raj built a guillotine out of a bookshelf, and I took two pages of notes.”  Penny frowns, chopsticks stuck in midair. “You can’t kill Sheldon, Leonard.” He fixes her with a pointed look. “Again, we can, but we’re not allowed to.”

“Ten bucks says one of us dies. Or sleeps with the boss.” They flip the page of the script together. “Told you.”

“I don’t like olives. They’re too small.”
“Makes sense, sir. Your size is formidable. You mist have custom shirts, right?”

“I don’t know if it’s correct, but he said it with so much confidence that I don’t even care.”
~
“Yeah, I said skillz with a ‘z’. I’m still doing that.”
~
“What are these?” she asked, picking at the piece of paper sticking out of her book. 
“Bookmarks. Or an apology, your choice.”
“These are plane tickets to Athens,” she said with a growing smile. 
“Doesn’t mean they can’t be bookmarks.”
~
“You realize that you never thought our friends were criminals until you got superpowers.”
“No, I never thought our friends were criminals until we made friends with criminals.”

“When you take her out to dinner, just make sure it’s some place where you look down instead of up at the menus.”

“His name is Jonathan James Kai’hoalaloai’u Johnson.”
“Can I have you spell the middle name for me?”
“Which one? He has two middle names.”
“Not James.”
~
“He has an identical twin who wears glasses? That’s the worst disguise since Clark Kent and you believe him?!”
~
“That’s because you’re from the Rockies. There’s no air up there. Your brain? Not normal.”

“I was watching this show on the Discovery Channel and it said that if you kill a starfish, it just comes back to life.”
“Was the starfish wearing boxers? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.”

“I haven’t been to a comic book store in years. This place is awesome! Where do they keep the Archies?”
“In the bedrooms of twelve year old girls, where they belong.”

“I think we’d have a better chance of winning Best Group Costume if we fixed our weak link: Leonard as Superman.”
“Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.”
“That’s sad. Let’s think of whether we know anyone more manly and fitting to be the Last Son of Krypton.”
“Than Leonard in high heeled boots? Howard’s mother in high heeled boots.”
~
“It took three cars, two sets of stairs and a body double to get me here, so can we be quick?”
~
“I can’t sue my own client; there’s a whole canon of ethics against that. And I’m pretty sure they call it a cannon because it can kill me.”

“He erased all history of his actions on my computer. Fortunately, I have a secret keylogger, so we can still find out.”

~ “And you have no idea why he needed to set up a meeting with you?” Marshall queried.
“None,” Mary snapped in response, “because the moron went and disappeared, didn’t he?”
“I hear you lost a witness,” Stan said, coming out of his office and grabbing the last cup of coffee from the tray on Marshall’s desk.
“I didn’t lose him,” Mary growled, “He lost himself and that’ll be the least of his worries when I get a hold of him.”
~
“I didn’t bring it here!” Melin said. Arthur snorted disbelievingly. “Arthur, it’s taller than the door. How would I even get it in here? Through the window using an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys?”
“You could have used sorc—” Gwen coughed, Merlin nervously clenched his fists and Arthur cut himself off, cleared his throat and said, “Er, yes, an elaborate system of ropes. And Pulleys. Through the window. Exactly so.”
~
“The Oncoming Storm is here,” said the dragon. Cryptically, of course.
“Um, okay,” said Merlin, trying to work out how something could be both oncoming and already here. “Thanks anyway.”
~
“Merlin, open the door,” Arthur ordered. Merlin reached out and gave the handle a half-hearted tug; nothing happened.
“No,” said Morgana, “he means ’open’ the door. Don’t worry, Gwen and I will stick our fingers in our ears and hum loudly, and Arthur will have a little lie down and pretend to be unconscious.”
“I do not pretend to be unconscious.”
“I could really knock you out, if you’d like?” Morgana suggested. Merlin grinned at Gwen, and while the nobles were bickering he whispered a spell and the door opened.
~
“Nothing to fear?” he said, his eyes holding Arthur’s, seeing the knowledge already there. “Have you any idea how many people have been put to death, just since I came here, for what you’re suggesting I might be hiding?”
“Fourteen.”
Merlin started. “Yes,” he said, hoarsely. “How did you—?”
“I am not my father, Merlin. I know the number, and I can tell you each of their names.”
~
“Jo—” he starts, waffling between ‘I’m sure it looks worse than it actually is’, and ‘If I try to give you a hug right now will you dislocate my shoulder?’.
~
“Well, George, you see, there’s this tradition,” he explained. “You hang mistletoe close to Christmas, and then if two people get caught under it at the same time—”
George rolled his eyes. “I bloody know what it’s for!” he exclaimed. “I want to know why it’s here!”
~
Guinevere shot him a look that managed to say “I hope you’re not hurt, sire” while also saying “Seriously, you didn’t see that coming?” 
~
“Mmmmpppphhhlllffffffff,” said Arthur, which is Sleepy Person for “Bugger off.”
~
“Was it just me or did I see a billboard with your face on it on the drive home?”
“Was it my whole face? All I saw was the nose.”
~
“Cut the condescending crap. It makes you come off…bald.”
~
“Oh, come on. The bad section of the neighbourhood is at least one block over.”
“Well, murderers have been known to take the occasional stroll.”
~
“Nice to meet you, Miss…do you have a name? Or do people refer to you only with adjectives?”
~ “You’re wrong. I’m not in love with Natalie. I haven’t been acting weird around her. And even if I were in love with her, I’m charming and suave when it comes to wooing women.”
~
“Come on, no one said you’d be a vegetable.”
“No, I was combining blindness, paralysis and an inability to speak into one, easy-to-remember term.”
~
“If he was any more qualified, he’d be a fictional TV character.”
~
“I was going to tell you yesterday.”
“Yeah, I could totally tell from the way you didn’t say anything.”
~
“If you won’t tell me what the joke was, I’ll just tell one of my own. There was a man travelling on a train from Mumbai to Delhi, and his wife was travelling on a train from Delhi to Mumbai…and I’m just realising that this isn’t a joke it’s a math problem. The punch line is ‘two hours’.”
~
“How are you dealing with your feelings for Maggie?”
“By not having them?”
~ They ask her the same question, every day—tell me what you know about NCIS—and she always answers the same way: the coffee is terrible; the desks are too small; the uniforms are unflattering; I can see the Washington monument if I stand on the roof…
~
“So when do you think it started?” Gibbs asks dryly, foregoing a greeting on the one-year mark.
“Definitely after Superman II. Oh, sorry—I thought we were talking about when Superhero movies stopped being good.”
Gibbs ignores him. “DiNozzo.”
He sighs. “I don’t know, boss. One day I wasn’t in love with her, and the next day I was, and I don’t remember not loving her just like I don’t remember actually falling. Maybe it was the first day we met, maybe it was last week. I don’t know.”
There’s a beat. Then, almost surprised, “That was easier than I thought it would be.”
“Yeah, well, Yael David says that if I lie God will reach down and smite me.”
~ “I was not asking for a fashion critique,” Arthur snapped. Merlin forgave him for it, mostly because he expected he’d be a bit short-tempered too if he were being forced to wear that outfit. There were certain duties that came attached to the title of crowned Prince of Camelot, and accepting eccentric outfits to wear to banquets in honour of foreign princesses was one of them.
~
“He said something about putting my boys in a vice, and seeing as I don’t have any sons, that sends my mind to a very dark place.”
~
“He was a third degree black belt and I’m a white man with no belt. Who do you think won?”
~
“Officially, he went missing. Unofficially? If you were to do some digging in those woods out back, he wouldn’t be so missing anymore. And their political connections ensure that no one can do that digging.”
~
“Why would you think I’m off my game?”
“A: Handcuffs. B: The bomb you’re sitting on.”
~
“Go check and see if Mom’s in the car. She won’t come in unless she’s invited up.”
“Like a vampire. I see an arm. What’s the probability that she hung a sever arm out the window just to mess with you?”
~
“Just give me five minutes for coffee and then I will look at whatever you want me to if it will make this conversation stop.”
~
“You could work upstairs with me, with real writers and wear grown up clothes and get a serious haircut. I want that for you, especially the haircut.”
~
“Yeah, I’ve slept with twenty-one guys. I went to college. You didn’t go to college. It was a different time. There was free love.”
“It was 1992. You were just a slut.”
~
“I wore red cowboy boots to school…once. They ripped them off my feet and beat me up with them. In a way, I kicked my own ass.”
~
“You’ve got to get rid of the guy. If I wanted to feel guilty for robbing banks, I’d go back to living with my parents.”
~
“Can I just ask you one little question?”
“Yes, and that was it.”
~
“I’m measuring square footage. It’s what men do. If you had a boar, I’d kill it. Do you have a boar?”
“No, I don’t.”
“Then I have to do this.”
~
“Wait, don’t tell me. Your name is Bob? Bobinson? Bobert?”
“Yes.”
“Wait, your name is Bob Bobinson Bobert.”
“Two years ago, you told me that you only wanted to hear me say yes. Which is tricky, because you don’t always ask yes/no questions.”
~
“I do not like clowns. Are they happy? Are they sad? Why are their pockets so big?”
~
“Well, since you are the owner, we should do what you say. Oh wait, you’re not the owner. I’m the owner. See that oil painting of me? They don’t do oil paintings of people who don’t own things, Ben.”
~
“Oh, she’s very nice. Quiet. Always on time. But, remind me again, what did she do? She lit a man on fire?”
“There was an investigation. The evidence is inconclusive. But, yes.”
~
“Suppose the wife did nothing: suppose she was a proverbial bon-bon eater…”
~
“In future editions of this textbook, I think I might just edit this section out because fewer and fewer people are getting their indecency via Dial-a-Porn.”
~
“I had a nice time tonight.”
“It’s not polite to sound surprised.”
~
“He’ll stand by you. And the baby. And he’ll probably even marry you if you want him to because he’s a Catholic and fucked up like that.”
~
“Actually, it is very simple. People come tell me how they do – things. Then they want me to say if what they deed so far is good or bad, and what they should do better.” He pulled a face, as if annoyed at his own description – whether because it was the wrong or the right one, Margo couldn’t tell.
Agnes’ mouth pursed with concentration. Then she brightened. “Like Santa?”
For a second Gru looked like he was about to argue with that, then thought better of it. “Yes, yes,” he muttered. “Like Santa and his book of naughty children. Hence all the paperwork –  I’m happy you understand!”
~ Then all at once the weight of Sam’s gaze is heavy on the top of Dean’s head, but Dean’s good at accidentally not meeting Sam’s eyes when he wants to be. Sam toys with his hash browns and Dean can hear the thoughts firing off in his brother’s brain. Too loud for seven a.m. “What?” he asks finally. “I never thought about it like that,” Sam says immediately, like they’re continuing on some earlier conversation. Sam does that, and usually Dean can pick up the thread, but it’s early and all he wants to think about is eggs.
~ “You remember Lucas?” Sam asks out of nowhere, as Dean guides the Impala through a tollbooth outside of Gary. “No, Sam, I’ve totally forgotten the creepy underaged homicidal lake ghost.”
~ “Come now, Bingley,” he laughed. “You know my views. Certainly if Society, despite extraordinary efforts on the part of all of the mothers and guardians of the Realm, has not yet brought into my sphere one woman—not one!—whom I could consider the companion of my heart, such a woman must be assumed not to exist.”
“Hang it all, Darcy. You barely glance at a one of them.”
“A glance is all that’s necessary.”
~
‘I can’t even drive!’  he yells. Telepathically. Because apparently unicorns are fucking telepathic. “Come on,” Sam says, with a big stupid grin like this is the best thing ever. “You’re alive. And you’ve got magical healing powers. And you’ll be able to change back in half a year.”
~
“Can’t you turn the glow off or something?” Sam asks, gesturing uneasily. “You’re kind of... visible.”
‘Hey, it’s your fault I’m a fucking unicorn,’ Dean mutters, because it’s true, but he starts testing his unicorn muscles just in case one of them is the Turn Stupid Silvery Glow Off muscle. When he tries to wrinkle his forehead, a rainbow suddenly leaps from his horn and streaks off across the darkening sky. He doesn’t know how it’s possible, but being a unicorn just got even stupider.
~
“I bow to your superior knowledge of the fairer sex,” Merlin said in a tone Arthur wasn’t sure he approved of.
~
“Let me see if I’ve got this straight,” said Arthur, who had taken many blows to the head and sometimes needed things said aloud to be sure of following them. “You’re a magician, and Morgana is a sorceress—”
~ “Morgana,” Arthur interrupted, “we hear you’ve been hiding in cupboard.”
“Yes, well, I’m in Merlin’s body. I assumed if I saw you you’d ask me to do manservant things.”
“Why,” complained Arthur, “do you say ‘manservant things’ like it includes recreational buggery?”
~
‘College is good  Classes are sweet.  Girls and kegs abound.  You’d like it.’ Dean grins. “Abound”?  Maybe the kid does belong in college. He texts back, ‘Ok good.  Don’t drink 2 much & make ass of yourself. Litewait.’ The answer is immediate.  ‘You’re a jerk.  And its lightweight.’ Dean snorts.  ‘They teach you spelling already?  Advanced shit.’
~ Dwight audibly gasps, and Pam has to put her hand up over her mouth to cover the smile. Jim makes a triumphant fist under the table at her. And that’s how Dwight ends up challenging Jim to a duel in the Dunder Mifflin parking lot. Weapon: bowstaffs.
~
Jim has known for some time that him plus vodka does not equal good decision making, and so he goes with his gut and says “Dare,” before his better judgment kicks in to ruin things. His heart is racing, and when he looks at Kelly she has that gleam in her eye that he was secretly hoping for. He is really freaking drunk if he is actually thinking these things, in actual words. Next thing he knows, he’ll be confiding in Michael again. “I dare you to kiss Pam,” Kelly says, in a tone like she’s just won truth or dare.
~
“Number of bags of candy corn you ate the week after Halloween?” “Hey!” she says. “They were on sale.” “That is not an answer.” He raises his eyebrows at her.
~
“I dropped some horn mints,” Sam tossed some of the white packing material into the air, watching them land on the floor. “The special snowflakes.”
“Or-na-ments,” Dean corrected his little brother. “And those were really expensive snowflakes,” Dean said.
“Don’t sweat it, Deuce,” Caleb said. “Dad was a ‘special snowflake’ for letting that clerk convince him Swarovski crystals were childproof.”
~
“Have you ever made cookies, Mackland?”
“I’m a brain surgeon for God’s sake. How hard could it be?”

Peter spends a year searching before he even gets an image of the so-called Nick Halden: not a great one, high-angle, security camera blurry, black-and-white. But it shows the flash of his smile, just; his gaze is raised, as if he knows not only that he is under surveillance, but who watches him.
~
They’re in the middle of tracking down a jewel thief and Neal can’t shut up about how second-rate the guy is, how much better he could have done it, how much better he has done it, nudge nudge, remember that time in, oh, better not say. What Peter wants to say—what he should have said—is that if Neal’s so goddamn smart why hasn’t he figured out how to catch the guy yet?
What Peter actually says is: “Will you put a sock in it, Francis?” Neal whips around to stare at him, slack-jawed. It’s hard to tell how much of a performance it is. The one good thing about it is that he has, in fact, shut the hell up.
“Francis?” Cruz snickers.
“It’s his real name,” Peter says, though if he’d been thinking he would have played it off as a joke, which he realizes moments later.
“My name,” says the personage in question with deep affront, “is Neal.”
So Peter feels compelled to elaborate on his behalf: “He was raised in a Catholic orphanage. Nuns picked it.”
“I picked it myself. It’s my name,” says Neal.
“You know that’s not how names work, right?” says Jones.
“You spelled it wrong,” Peter helpfully points out. He has been wondering why Neal-with-an-a-not-an-i for a while.
“It’s from annealing,” Neal sniffs. “It’s a blacksmithing process.”
“And you think being raised by nuns was a trial by fire?” Peter asks.
~
“But,” says Elizabeth. They both look at her. “But you want him to know,” she prompts Peter.
“Know what?” Peter asks. What fixes this one?
“You really should just leave it to me,” Elizabeth says. She turns to Neal. “Honey, your father loves you very much and you make him proud. None of what he just said was meant to imply anything else.” Peter thinks that should be obvious. It’s all stuff he’s said—not all at once and not in such emphatic terms, but Neal reads people, it’s what he does, surely he got the message. “Now,” says Elizabeth, “is there anything you’d like to say to him, or should I carry both sides of the conversation?”
~
Deliberately, Peter stands up, drops his napkin on the table, and holds out his arms. Neal pushes up from his chair and tentatively steps up to Peter. Peter pulls him close. Neal’s tense and so is Peter and Peter doesn’t feel Neal relax, at all, which means that he can’t either. After a moment, Neal says, slightly muffled and entirely flippant, “This is really awkward. Maybe we could come up with some other way to express our affection.”

“I still think you need to talk about your feelings more,” Elizabeth opines.
“Yeah, I’m going to freak him out if I keep doing that,” Peter says wryly. “He didn’t even take the hug well.”
~ “You mean you stayed in prison for three and a half years because I put you there?”
“No,” Neal says unconvincingly. Then: “Not entirely.”
“Yes, there were guards and bars and locks and stuff.” Elizabeth nods wisely. Neal glares, because these things were no impediment when he put his mind to it and everyone knows it.
~ Neal single-handedly gets a full confession from the bungling burglar by sitting down with him and offering to look over his work, supposedly to give helpful hints about being a more successful criminal but mostly as an excuse to get the most scathing criticisms off his chest. Peter might have stepped in if there had been any signs of molding more successful criminals, but it’s mostly along the lines of don’t do that, ever, are you stupid, with no alternatives offered, only reasons why it’s a very bad idea, and some of the bad ideas Neal is berating him for include don’t carry a gun, especially if you don’t have any intent to use it—and carrying a toy gun is like, the definition of intent not to use it—because if it looks like you have a gun eventually someone will shoot you which is an important safety tip Peter wished more crooks followed to the extent of Neal’s general avoidance of guns.
~ “Yes! How is she?”
“Evil.” 
“Oh,” said Jenny, in the tone of voice of someone who didn’t see that as a massive barrier.
~
“I found her for you! I did what you asked! Because the list of things I wouldn’t do for you is approximately two items long and the second one is: help you get yourself killed!”
~ “Classic doesn’t mean old,” Neal protests. “It means… timeless. Formal, adhering to particular rules.”
“Says the man in the fedora.”
“Exactly.”
~ She stabbed her sweet and sour pork, scowling. “Stupid rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. I still say that stupid rock would crush Spock.”
“You’ve already agreed to the stipulation that Spock would not be travelling in an area prone to rockfalls without a Type-1 phaser.” 
~ “What do you mean, he’s gone?” Penny yelled over the spray of the water.
“Why must you persist in making me repeat the simplest statements?” Sheldon complained.
~
She screamed and jumped away. Howard winced and covered his ears.
“Penny, what’s wrong?” Sheldon cried as he and Missy burst into the room. He used Missy, who was brandishing a lightsaber like a baseball bat, for cover and pointed his phaser around the room. “Is it Morlocks?”
“Why the hell would there be Morlocks in the apartment?” Penny asked.
~
“Penny, this is Sheldon.” It had taken her a long time to convince him that he didn’t need to announce his full name every time she answered his calls. “Cooper.” They were still working on it.
~
“Will you slow down?” he pleaded as she rolled through another stop sign. “They don’t give out Nobel Prizes posthumously.”
“Oh, hush up, you. You told me yourself you’re at least six months away from a prize-winning breakthrough.”
~ “Maybe that was his cunning plan all along,” Raj said.
“If you mean ‘cunning plan’ in the Blackadder sense, I agree.”
~
Sheldon looked confused. He raised a hand and asked, “Do you want me to do the math or was that a rhetorical question?”
~ “You think pictures of hatchling ducks speaking Pidgin English are adorable,” Sheldon pointed out. “Your reference points are clearly skewed.”
~ He finds someone who looks vaguely less intoxicated than most of the party-goers and asks where he should put the two bottles of liquor he brought, gets directed to the kitchen, where someone’s making Izellian Mojitos on the kitchen island and someone else looks like they’re about to make them flaming Izellian Mojitos.
~
“What are you doing today?”
“Plotting to take over Albion.” Arthur glared, Morgana sighed. “Sewing, why?”
~
Gwen wasn’t like Merlin, she would never say ‘shut up, you royal idiot’ to Morgana’s face. But she had a facial expression: a raised eyebrow and slightly down-turned lips, which said it for her.
~
“So, I was teaching the basic class this afternoon – you know, the absolute basic class? Not even communications or linguistics, just how to say hello, don’t shoot me in a number of galactic languages in case the universal translator goes out.” “I took that,” McCoy said, reminiscently. “I told the only Andorian in the class I wanted to bear her children.” A pause. “Theirs is a very tonal language.” Another pause. “And she did have very attractive antennae.”
~
Utterly fed up Morgana threw herself from the bed and slammed the door open. “What is—?” she cut herself off; she was not yet crazy enough to be shouting at an empty hallway. 
‘Morgana.’ Morgana stepped back into her chambers and firmly closed the door.  ‘Mor—’
“In a minute!” she snapped. She went to the cupboard and pulled on her dressing gown, slippers and a fur wrap. Now at least semi-decently attired she stepped out into the corridor, “Well?” 
‘Morgana.’
“I see,” she said coldly. “I’ll just follow the sound of your voice through this freezing castle at midnight, shall I?” Rolling laughter was the only response. “I don’t appreciate being laughed at by a figment of my imagination, you know.” 
~
“You never mortally offended Lady Helen, did you?” 
“Believe it or not, Morgana, with women other than yourself I am the model of chivalry and charm.” 
~
“God, Gwen, stop apologising. It isn’t as though you took ill on purpose.” 
“I’m sorry, I—” Gwen broke off and laughed, even Morgana smiled slightly. “I just meant that after years of complaining about Arthur always getting to be the hero you got to fight the monster and save the day.” 
“I got soaked to the skin, I ruined a perfectly lovely dress, I broke a fingernail, I got clay in my hair. And I can’t even tell anyone about it!” 
~
‘Morgana.’ She rolled her eyes; she’d really thought the Dragon was through with the middle of the night summonses. She threw on her dressing gown as quietly as possible and was nearly out the door when— ’Bring the sword.’ Oh, good, because sneaking through the castle in the dead of night clutching a sword looked so much less suspicious. She arrived in the cave with the sword in one hand and a torch in another. “It’s not that I don’t enjoy these little talks of ours, but one of these days I would like to sleep through the night.”
~
“I don’t really know what to say to that.” 
“Traditionally one receives a compliment by saying thank you.” 
~ “I’m the picture of health. Your concern, Arthur, is most... uncharacteristic.” 
“I’m sure you meant appreciated.” 
~
They tried to leave Arthur’s chambers exactly as they’d found them, which basically meant dropping the few things they’d picked up back onto the floor. 
~
Four years and three days after their arrangement becomes official, Peter and Neal sign their names about fifty different times on the bottoms of a whole ream worth of papers, Jones cuts Neal’s ankle tracker for the last time, and Neal is officially a free man. They throw him a party in the office: cake, balloons, a card. Thanks for all the help closing cases. Good job not doing anything so illegal we had to arrest you for it over the last four years. Aside from, well, the three times you were framed, and that other time. But no hard feelings about that, right?
~ “I’ll spare you.” It was hard to say that without laughing, but they always believed it. They didn’t have a choice.

“Spock, humour the human.” He jerked his head, encouragingly. “Hit me.”

“Is it a crime to pay another woman to give me the love my wife is withholding from me?”
“Yes.”
“Yeah, I know it’s a crime. But is it a crime crime?”
“Yes yes.”

“Wikipedia claims she’s mostly a painter, but Wikipedia also claims that ‘The topic of this article may not meet the notability guideline for biographies.’”

How is it possible that she looks not only exactly the same as she did on Sex and the City, but basically the same as she did when she was on Melrose Place when she cracked her head on that cursed pool and died and then spent a couple of weeks half-heartedly haunting poor Billy? Why doesn’t this woman have a blog in which she explains all her beauty secrets? Sure, perhaps it would only read, “sunscreen and good genes,” but still. Then we would know!

“This website is about seven bajillion times more awesome when your friends are using it too. We have proven this. With science.”
~ On the fifth day of Christmas, Veronica got four gold rings that turned anyone who wore them into a minion and the one ring to bind them all from Phil and Lem. She admired the binding ring on her hand and had Dr. Bhamba stand on one foot. She could have done it without the ring, but the delight on Phil and or Lem’s face made her feel like giving something back.
~
Rose narrowed her eyes. “It’s wrong to fire people at Christmas. Or Hanukkah.” She tilted her head adorably. “Or the other one.”
“Kwanza.” Veronica spread her perfect hands. “You think it’s wrong to fire people Kwanza. But that’s just wrong thinking. If we fire them, then the government will give them free money and they won’t have to work at all. It’s like we’d be giving them a Kwanza gift.”
~
“How should I know? You’re the nurse.”
“Sorry, Amy, but I was ill the day they covered what to do when the thousand year old alien you’re travelling through space with keels over and turns into a woman.”
The Doctor sat bolt upright. “I’m a woman?” He clasped his hands to his chest and yelped. “I’ve got breasts.”
“Nice ones,” said Amy reassuringly.
“I hadn’t noticed,” said Rory, staring up at the ceiling.
~
“Because you’re not wearing any shoes and that bowtie looks even more ridiculous than it did before.”
“Bowties are co...” the Doctor looked into Amy’s eyes. “They’re not, are they?”
~
“Sorcery most foul!” bellowed Uther.
“There’s no such thing as magic,” said the Doctor.
“Oh, bloody hell,” said Donna.
~
“Well,” said the Doctor, “we’re all lonely.”
“I’m not,” said Donna, who hadn’t finished her first cup of coffee and really thought the cryptic conversations could keep till about lunchtime. She shoved a mug of tea into Morgana’s hands to distract her from making any more opaque pronouncements. 
~
“That was nice,” said the Doctor. His hair was plastered to his forehead with mud. “A nice bracing walk in the fresh air. Wasn’t that nice, Donna?” Donna was about to tell him in no uncertain terms that no, no it had not been nice. It had, in fact, been a swamp, a swamp that the TARDIS had sank waist deep into in the fifteen minutes that they’d been away. 
~
Donna found Morgana in the TARDIS kitchen, sitting at the table. In her hands was the dagger she’d used to slit the throat of the Emperor of Thallis IV. “No deadly weapons at the table,” Donna informed her.

“What do small humans do to celebrate birthdays in your time? You’re not from the time when they whack a donkey with a stick, are you? I never liked that game.”

Sheldon rolled his eyes and held out what seemed like half of his thick sheaf of paper to Penny who took it reluctantly. Looking down, she read: Sheldon Cooper’s Apocalypse Plan No 19: Sudden Ice Age. Neatly written in one corner was her name. “Is this some sort of joke?”
~
“It is a well documented law of physics that slapping, hitting or otherwise physically assaulting electronic objects is not a scientifically-viable method of fixing said objects,” Sheldon said calmly.

“They are alphabetized,” Gus points out. “They’re categorized, then alphabetized according to author, and then according to title. I don’t just alphabetize them, because categorization is a superior sorting method. Alphabetization as a single sorting process should only be used for items that all belong to the same category.”

Over the course of his rather interesting life, Kyle Hobbes had the misfortune to have bunked with all manner of people and most of them irritated him. Surprisingly, Former Father Jack Landry was not one of them. The blonde man was neat, not prone to senseless chatter and didn’t get flustered by the occasional appearance of a multitude of large guns and knives.
~
“Listen, Betazoid women when they’re forty, they have this thing. It’s called the Phase. Now, I’m not saying I have or I haven’t, but oh my god. Alien life is beautiful. I hear.”
~
“Hello, where the hell have you been? I have a bored swordsman bugging me and if I don’t come up with a good excuse he’s going to make me practice fencing with him all afternoon.”
“What’s wrong with that? You love mindless violence for the fun of it,” she pointed out.
~
Uhura marched onto the bridge well after her shift had ended to find Kirk, who was snoozing authoritatively in his captain’s chair. She kicked the underside of it and placed a hand on her hip so as to better strike fear in his heart as he woke. “Hey,” he tried.
“Did you happen to, I don’t know, attack my boyfriend for no reason earlier today?” Jim thought about it. “Mmm, no.”
“Really? Because from what he tells me it sounds a lot like that’s what happened.” “Listen, you should know by now that when I do things I tend to have reasons. If I feel like it. Sulu’s starting a fencing club and teaching everybody and we want Spock to join. I thought you’d be happy we’re letting him in all our reindeer games.”
“And you didn’t just tell him because...” “It was funny?” “Right.” Nyota crossed her arms at her chest and looked around the near-empty bridge for a moment. The ensign at the helm was trying hard to be invisible. He’d go far in Starfleet. “And you didn’t invite me because...” Jim scratched at his temple for several seconds, as Nyota’s gaze bore down upon him. Finally, he gave his best shot. “You don’t already know how to fence?”
~
“Y’know Bobby?” Dean went on, chasing a thought elusive as a will o’ the wisp, tracking it around the room with his slightly unfocused gaze as though it were actually solid.  And present.  “He’s…  Man.  Bobby.  Is…fuckin’ awesome.  Knows ever’thing.”
“Oooh,” said the girl.  “Okay.”
“An’ Sam?  He’s…” Sam knew better than to expect “awesome.”  He cocked an eyebrow, waiting for Dean to chase down the adjective that kept fluttering past him. “Tall,” Dean sputtered, forefinger jabbing in Sam’s general direction.  “You ever see anybody that fuckin’ tall?  Stan’ up, Sammy.”
“Maybe later,” Sam said.
~ Blackadder could have asked why this was, or asked what Baldrick had done wrong, or cast aspersions on Baldrick’s ancestry, comportment, and general mental faculty. Instead, he chose to hit him.
~
“What the bloody hell is going on here?!” The voice was male, but the tone could only belong to a thirty-something woman who had spent the past few months of her life being carted around the universe by a mad alien, and was quite frankly sick of things like this happening. It was the sound of Donna reaching the obvious conclusion. The Doctor stumbled out of Donna’s bedroom, wearing Donna’s her pink pyjamas, and found Donna standing in the corridor pointing his own finger menacingly at him.
“You! Get out of my body this instant!”
“And how exactly do you suggest I do that?” The Doctor enjoyed the use of Donna’s vocal chords; her voice had that sort of sneering tone that was appropriate for situations like this. “It wasn’t me. It was that machine. Come on, there must be a reverse button on it or something.” The Doctor walked in the direction of the console room, thinking that if the universe had any gratitude at all for all the things he’d done for it then there would be a reverse button on the bodyswapping machine.

“Rose took me to work with her today because she cannot bear to be without me. Either that or she thinks I need constant supervision. It’s definitely one of the two.”
~
There was a cooking rota. Notionally, at least, there was a cooking rota. Arthur couldn’t cook, and he caused a terrible mess in the process of not cooking. Morgana did a marvellous line in ringing out for Chinese food. Merlin was an absolutely fabulous cook, as long as you only wanted cheese-on-toast. Gwen had actually been taught to cook as child. But she refused to do it every night on the principle that she wasn’t the mother of anyone in the house.
~ “It’s not their fault,” said Merlin, as he and Gwen were cleaning one day. Arthur and Morgana were doing their version of cleaning, which seemed to consist entirely of moving dirt around the room. “If we’d been raised by nannies and cleaning ladies, we wouldn’t have any idea how to clean either.”
~
“You know the thing about mojitos? They make you feel all better. Like a tropical beach party in your mouth. I mean, look at me. I’m having a great time.”
“You sure? Because you’re sitting her all on your own.”
~
“It really hit me that we were living together this morning; I was sitting in the bathroom and I saw a twenty-pack of Charmin and thought ‘Oh god, we’re going to be together through all that toilet paper’.”
~
“You need to chillax?”
“Yeah, I know. I regretted it the moment I said it, but you know what I mean.”
~
“Look, I don’t know what the rules are where you come from, but, here on earth, you tell your girlfriend you don’t want to talk to her and she just runs you over with her car.”
~
“Dude, don’t worry about it. I got a guy. His specialty is apology flowers. You just ask him for the Bastard Bouquet.”
“Oh boy, how much is that going to set me back?”
“I don’t know. Lisa pays the bills.”
~
“She said my coffee is not the only thing she’d like to put whipped cream on. I think she’s interested.”
~ “Bar,” Hobbes replied smoothly, but, from the glances his back up dancers exchanged, clearly there was something else afoot.
Pointing to a large crate, Jack said, “You’ve got enough booze in there to give Keith Richards and Charlie Sheen alcohol poisoning. It’s right in there with the AK’s.”
Hobbes hadn’t expected a fight, so he frowned and Sid said, “It’ll be fun! It’s….”
“A karaoke bar!” Chad interrupted, elbowing the scientist in the side. Hobbes just heaved an annoyed sigh.
Dear God, they were really bad liars. Still, Jack figured they were going to go do something idiotic, so he’d better tag along to be the adult supervision. “I don’t believe a word of that,” he told then, but rose and grabbed his jacket. “But I suppose I’m up for getting out of her for a while.” The smirks should have told him he was making a poor decision.
~
“Did you like, skip over a few chapters in the Guy Handbook? You know, the ones that say a guy must take any opportunity presented to him to stare at boobs? Especially naked ones.”
Giving him a sour look, Jack intoned, “They erase those chapters from your memory in seminary and replace them with psalms.”
~
“Sometimes family has to make sacrifices for each other. Like the one my lower body made pushing out that beach ball sized head of yours. You owe me for that.”

“I was here for twenty years taking care of her, and it was no day at the beach. Or maybe it was; I wouldn’t know, I’ve never had a day at the beach.”

“Heather is…”
“Insane?”
“I was going to say ‘my assistant’ but your word is really right too.”
~ “That’s a parrot,” Dana says. “We are apparently now a parrot-friendly workplace. We are inclusive of the parrot.”
“The parrot is a noble and majestic bird,” Jeremy says. “It’s known for its nobility. And its majesty.”
“You’re out of parrot-related trivia?” Natalie asks, looking a bit surprised.
“I skipped that section of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. It’s their beady eyes. Reminds me of paintings where the eyes follow you.”
“You know that parrots’ eyes actually follow you, right, honey?” Dana says.
“When Dana says, ‘honey,’ she means, ‘dumbass,’” Natalie says, helpfully.
~
So far, the parrot is far more interested in Kim’s sparkly holiday tights, and keeps saying, “Shiny penny, shiny penny,” then babbling in what sounds like Spanish mixed with Italian mixed with absolute nonsense.
“Who even teaches a parrot Esperanto?” Casey asks.
“You’re just mad the parrot knows one more language than you do,” Dana says.
~
This pamphlet includes a piece on the Sports Night official ‘nog’ recipe, which appears to be little more than an excuse to add brandy and rum to whiskey and consume while wearing festive mittens. Casey, it seems, has brought everyone mittens.
~
“No, I do. It’s just, Merlin, this girl. You didn’t see her. The car, the clothes, where on earth am I going to go with a girl like that?”
“I didn’t see her, but Will did, he’s made up a little song about it. Will, sing that song.”
~ Gwen is in no danger of starving to death herself, even after Merlin and his diabolical attempts at cheese on toast moved out and left her without a flatmate. But Morgana can cook like people on television can cook.
She’s even got one of those miniature blowtorches for the tops of crème brûlées.
~
“I love you! I love you, you stupid idiot. How’s that for a gesture?”
“Um.” To be honest, Gwen could have lived without the stupid idiot bit. Apart from that it was nice, unexpected, but nice.
~
The first one home every evening was responsible for fixing dinner in those days, and when Sam didn’t have after-school activities, that job had his name on it. He was beginning to suspect the only reason Dean was able to talk Dad into letting him sign up for any extracurricular stuff was so they wouldn’t have to eat Sam’s cooking.
~ His day wouldn’t be complete without Zedd’s stomach growling loudly in between the homilies he dished out, the Wizard’s rules that Richard was, even now, still half convinced that Zedd made up on the spot.
~ “I’ll have you know that went on no longer than fifteen minutes.”
“Because I interrupted you.”
~
“I love this song. Can you turn it up?”
“I don’t know. Can you join me for a shot of tequila?”
“I don’t know. Can you light it on fire?”

“Come on. You don’t get jealous of all those guys Julia goes “fund-raising” with all the time?”
“Don’t put sex-implying quotes around fundraising. That’s just her job.”
~
“Show us your boobs!” the drunk frat boy called out. 
“Dude, that’s my sister. Julia, it’s me; do not show us your boobs.”
“Yeah, Rex, that was really close” she said, sarcastically. “What are you even doing here?” 
~
“Hon, you’re not going to go through this alone. Did we not pledge in our wedding vows to love each other for richer or poorer?”
“I don’t know. It was all in Vietnamese.”
~
“We should have been rich. Why didn’t we start a hedge fund?”
“We don’t really know what they are.”
~
“Oh, well if you love Dave so much, why don’t you marry him.”
“If I lived in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massuchusetts, Connecticut, Iowa or California pending appeal, maybe I would.”
~ Creeping up behind Sid and Chad, Erica whispered, “Why are we staring?”
“It’s like watching two universes merging into a whole new world of scary. We’re used to seeing Hobbes playing with guns, but how often do you see a priest field strip an automatic weapon? Every day. In Bizarro Land!” Sid mocked.
“We can hear you,” Hobbes said without looking.
“Not a priest anymore,” Jack added, snapping the outer casing of an M9 back into place.
“This is even weirder than finding out that Jack’s catnip to strippers,” Sid muttered.
“I think he convinced three of them to go back to college,” Chad said, but Eric was still busy processing Sid’s comment.
“Do I even want to know about the strippers?” she asked, unsure whether she did or not. 
Jack’s shoulders tensed and she saw the back of his neck turn pink. It was Hobbes who responded. “No.” The menfolk had bonded. Apparently, there were strippers involved. She didn’t know why she found that prospect more than a little unsettling.
~
“So, your idea of man food is Ramen Noodles and microwavable hot wings?”
“And beer…at least tell me that’s beer you’re drinking,” Hobbes said, a note of hope in his voice.
~
“Of course I speak seven languages. When you’re a mercenary, it pays to know whether your employer is telling his men to ‘give him the money’ or ‘shoot him in the head’.”

“In case you’ve forgotten, back in the episode “Scales” (which all right-thinking people persist in calling by its original title, “Scales on a Train”) we learned that the mob boss Scales had been imprisoned by circus folk as a child. And he’d been taunted by a little person who snarled: “No cake for you!” So the clip above is really Scales passing along the abuse and trauma from his childhood. As a child, he was denied cake. And now, as an adult, he is denying cake to others. Thus the cycle is perpetuated.”

At least once a year since they defeated the Keeper, Zedd has gotten bored and turned up on their doorsteps to announce that it is of vital importance that they undertake a quest to save the world.
~
Kahlan, who’s walking a little way ahead, hand in hand with Richard, shoots Cara a look that says: Humour him. Anyway, isn’t this nice, all of us out in the sunshine like this.
Cara rolls her eyes at Kahlan as if to say: I’m only doing this for you. Also, we’re obviously spending too much time together, because being able to communicate like this can’t be normal.

Overthrowing Uther Pendragon isn’t that hard, he’s past his prime and more than a little mad. And his son, who commands most of the army, is away searching for the Holy Grail. He’s not going to find it, the Grail has been sitting on a shelf in Cara’s house ever since they’d all gone questing for it on Zedd’s birthday the year before last. 
~ Cara’s almost certain that Richard’s the true Lord Rahl this week. It’s honestly getting a bit hard to keep up with whether Darken Rahl is back from the dead or not at any given time.

“Someone must have worked in advertising and can corroborate this: we’re all the product of our demographics, right? You hit a certain age and you like Indie Chill and it’s not your fault.”

Merlin was exhausted just watching and he could tell how tired Arthur was from the fact that he had barely mocked Merlin all week and hadn’t even made him wear the insane feathered hat with his ceremonial uniform after the second banquet.
~
“You’re a bastard and I hate you,” he said conversationally, rolling an apple towards Merlin and Merlin shrugged agreement and bit into the apple to hide his grin. “But I suppose you might not be completely worthless.”
~
“Talk about… what… before… you knew?” Merlin said and Arthur blinked and then laughed. “Oh, very funny. Like you’ve been trying so hard to keep it a secret from me all…these… months…” he said trailing off and the smile fading as Merlin felt his face go white. “You stupid, reckless, half-witted, careless ass” Arthur yelled, grabbing Merlin by the shoulders and shaking him. “How the fuck are you still alive?”

Dr. Crusoe had introduced himself to Friday earlier that day in the gateroom in Colorado, and had spent most of their acquaintance trying to talk about science to Friday, while Friday had spent most of their acquaintance scowling and saying sarcastic things.

“Why aren’t you in the bathroom then?”
“Because,” Sam said miserably, pulling the blanket a little tighter, “if I look at the toilet I’ll puke.”

Ianto, however, was up to something. There was just a vibe of contrive around him. Jack thought that was catchy and gave himself a victory sip of coffee for being so clever. Ianto was up to something, because he so obviously wasn’t. Tosh was up to something too, Jack decided. Both of them were. Possibly together. Maybe taking over the world. He hoped they weren’t, because then he’d have to stop them. Then again, he thought, a world run by Tosh and Ianto would be very efficient, and possibly highly attractive. Tosh would make sure technology moved forward, Ianto could probably sort out this whole over-population and food shortage thing in a matter of months. They would make sure Jack had plenty of aliens to capture, and then Jack would be able to grin at the Doctor and show him how much better humanity would be. The Doctor would like Tosh. Jack decided that he would turn a blind eye on any world-conquering plans the two of them had. Unless Owen was involved. Jack was not okay with Owen part-owning the world.
~
“What?” he asked after Ianto’s stern Schoolmaster look appeared. Which was also a good look on him. Jack hoped he was the old fashioned sort of schoolmaster, who took to spanking naughty schoolboys. Jack wouldn’t study sums, but he’d make sure to learn- “Your five o’clock telecast meeting with Dr. Johnson is ready in the conference room.” Ianto said with a smile. It was like a reward for his naughty thoughts. Jack suspected that Ianto knew what Jack was thinking, and if he didn’t, Jack would make it priority one to think louder. He’d had a telepathic boyfriend once. Never could get anything done with that man around. No sooner would he bend over then he’d…well…bend over with a different intention than picking up a stray sock. Good times. Maybe Ianto was telepathic. Jack thought very, very hard about sex. “Sir? Teleconference?” No dice.
~
Also, if Ianto was the boss, then Jack could sleep his way to the top. Jack had always wanted to sleep his way to the top. Usually he slept himself to various other positions, and was on top rather often, but that was in bed. Usually the people above him weren’t very attractive, or they were scary bitch lesbians who chained him up and used him like a sex toy, and you couldn’t sleep yourself to the top as a sex toy. You mostly just slept yourself into a scary, scary rut.
~
“As a Torchwood employee, you aren’t supposed to know the combination to my personal vault.” Jack said very sternly, slowly inching a folded piece of paper toward Ianto. “I…don’t know the combination to your personal vault, sir.” Ianto frowned. “So I’m doing that part very well.” “There’s highly sensitive equipment in there, equipment that only the head of Torchwood should know about.” Jack continued, nudging the paper closer. “Who knows what could happen if someone else got their hands on it?”
~
Jack had been going to get Ianto flowers, but then he’d thought about it, and decided it wasn’t such a great idea. The dismembered sexual organs of a plant didn’t send the right message. They also died after a week, and that was sort of like “Well you’re pretty now, but after awhile you’ll molt and grow old and smelly, and then I’ll throw you away.”
~
“Confession magnifies love, right? How could I love you any more than I already do?” Her mouth fell open, and he gave her a wide, sincere grin before marching out into the corridor.

“It was the Con Dar, Richard.” 
Richard looked up at her from the other side of the fire. “You did seem really mad.”

“What do you mean ‘he coughed up a lung’?”
“He coughed, after which the respiratory organ which resided in his chest then resided in his mouth. Well, his hand and his mouth.”
~
“That phone call took too long for a wrong number.”
“I like human contact, Jimmy. Dog contact too. Cats are ok. Birds freak me out though.”

“We’re responsible, we’re also just passionate and spontaneous. Those would be gladiator names if we were ever on American Gladiators. Which we still might do.”
~
“We need another baby in this house like we need a gorilla throwing fireworks.”
~
“Ugh, these breath mints taste awful.”
“That’s because they’re sedatives. And that, kids, is how easy it is to get roofied. This should serve as a warning for the girls not an instructional aid for the boys.”
“Jimmy, you know how your mother and I always tell you that drugs are bad? We were wrong. They’re awesome. It’s like I’m floating and sinking at the same time. I’m flinking.”
~
“Where’s Robert?”
“I am Robert.”
“I meant the air-conditioning guy, Robert.”
“He’s Luis. He quit because you kept calling him Robert.”
~
“So, what are the chances of you forgetting I told you that without being hit over the head with something heavy?”
~
“What do you think? It makes me look fat, right?”
“I think it’s the pregnancy that makes you do that.”
~
He thought he was hiding his shock rather well, until he realized he was buttering his napkin. Fortunately, O’Connell was busy wallowing in self-pity and didn’t notice.
~
“You know I hate it when you smoke. Besides, you smell like a herd of cattle.”
“Evie, we’re on the Nile. That smell might actually be a herd of cattle.”

“I should probably go,” he said, making not the slightest effort to do anything of the sort.

“Saat Sehkmet iret Ra ahaa neser nebet nerew,” she said slowly, sounding out the ancient Egyptian.
“And for those of us who only know languages spoken in the last three thousand years?”

Rick whispered in wonderment, “You grew up with her?”
“I didn’t say I enjoyed it,” Evy told him.
~
“It probably contains the internal organs – if anything’s left by this time. Do you want to hear about the process of mummification?”
Sam sat down at his desk. “Okay, okay, I’ll shut up. You carry on there. This is my office, and you’re an intruder, but fine, don’t mind me.”
~
“Do you know why Sam’s got a girl in his office with an urn?”
Josh looked up slowly, frowning. “Is this a joke? Because I … don’t get it.”
~
Being Dean, he deals with it by trying to needle Sam into an argument, and Sam decides to go away and let him work off his aggression by beating several arithmetically challenged cons at poker.
~
Dean just gives him a disgusted look. “It was all over the yard. You should have knocked him on his ass.” “I didn’t want to draw attention,” Sam says defensively. “Not knocking him on his ass is what drew attention, genius,” Dean says in the same kind of overly-patient tones he’d use on a toddler. Actually, Sam’s heard him talking to toddlers, and he’s a damn sight more respectful than this.
~
“What makes you think anything’s wrong? Can’t a guy just try to cure cancer in his free time?” asks Bones gruffly. “Absolutely,” Jim agrees. “‘Free time’ being the operative words – typically when people are scheduled for senior staff meetings, that’s where they tend to be.” Bones closes his eyes. “I knew I was forgetting something.” “On the other hand, your punctuality record is better than mine, so I’d feel kind of stupid giving you shit about it,” Jim adds. “On the other hand, you want to talk about it?” “No,” says Bones. “Cool,” says Jim, clapping him on the back. “Let’s go get drunk.”
~
“You can’t have been that bad,” says Bones, because he’s really drunk. “I drove my step-dad’s car off a cliff.” Bones gapes for a long moment. When he can finally speak, the most intelligent thing he can think of to say is, “There are cliffs in Iowa?” “It was a quarry, technically. A really steep, cliff-like quarry.”
“There are quarries in Iowa?”
~
He is torn – on one hand, he’s not seventeen any more, and possibly more importantly people can’t keep denying him his vodka since he is now the official Federation age of majority; on the other hand, he is fairly certain that people will hug him if he tells them it is his birthday, since apparently being the youngest member of the crew means having to deal with excessive personal contact.
~
Pavel is mortified, even as Kirk and Sulu exchange grins that make it plain that they planned this. He reminds himself that he knows ways to make transporter-sickness as likely as possible, and these methods can be used the next time Kirk and Sulu have to go on an away mission. Preferably to a planet full of buxom blondes who will be considerably less receptive after having been thrown up on.
~
“You’ve got frosting on your forehead,” McCoy tells him. “How did you even manage that?” “I don’t care. I want to marry whoever made this. Or maybe just steal the recipe.”
~
He goes on to the appendices, which are mostly scientific logs and captions of graphs saying, “We pretty much have no idea what this is” or “this is the original source of this other thing that completely baffled us, go figure.”

“Why are they still naked?” Gibbs growls. He hasn’t seen that much pasty, embarrassed man since boot camp and he hasn’t missed it.
~
My big scary PASS THESE OR FAIL OUT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL exams are in less than a week, and watching Merlin was meant to be a nice joyful way to spend my study breaks, but...that didn’t exactly work out. Because this show makes me want to squeal in a high-pitched manner and have capslocky conversations about DESTINY and, obviously, write fic.
~ Merlin put on his best no-Gaius-I-wasn’t-doing-magic-no-really face—it was improving through sheer dint of repetition—and said, “I don’t know, it looks fine to me.”
~
What Arthur really needed, Merlin thought, was not a flipside to his coin or a tangled thread of Destiny or whatever the hell the Dragon was calling Merlin this week.
~ Arthur’s considering expression, when it appeared over the top of the cushion, had a little more sadism in it than Merlin considered entirely appropriate. “I thought you said you didn’t fancy, and I quote, being knocked around like a sack of hay. Which is exactly what you fight like, by the way, it’s disgraceful. We should do something about it.”
~
After five more minutes of ranting, three minutes of drawing Merlin into an argument and then trampling on his attempts to help, ten minutes of sulking and ignoring Merlin completely, and two minutes of grudging discussion of the preparations for tomorrow’s hunt, Arthur’s behaviour was inching closer to that of a reasonable human being. Merlin moved around the room pretending to clean things that were already clean and sneaking glances at Arthur, who was sitting on the floor, leaning against his bed and turning his— thankfully sheathed— dagger in his hands.
~ “Time,” it intoned, the booming sound glancing off the rocks, “will reveal all things.” “Enormously helpful, thank you,” Merlin muttered, and left the cave.
~
“You know that I wouldn’t lie to you.” He snorted. “You’re a terrible liar, Merlin.” “Right! Even better! So you’ll know that what I’m telling you is the truth.”
~
Merlin had learned to accept the things the Dragon said because, well, when a giant magical dragon with mysteriously intimate knowledge of your life told you things, you damn well listened to the coherent bits.
~
I believe this is what is called a ‘mugging,’” he said calmly, as if it was the strangest thing in the world, but yeah, nothing an angel of the Lord couldn’t handle.
Which was good, Dean figured blearily, because he was drunk and he was freakin’ useless. Damn good thing he hadn’t ended up walking back to the motel alone.
“It would be in your best interest to leave us be,” Castiel told the muggers. It was the voice he had used against the demons in that barn in Kentucky. The one that clearly promised that shit would shortly be thoroughly fucked up.
No one ever accused muggers of being smart. They came after him anyway. From Dean’s perspective it was all a big tan blur of Castiel’s trenchcoat moving in front of him, but he clearly heard the snapping of some poor fool’s arm, followed by a strangled scream. 
~
From his seat on the floor, surrounded by Arthur’s half-polished armour, Merlin did his best to make sympathetic faces. He nodded earnestly, the effect lost as Arthur continued to stare out of the window at the torchlit courtyard below. Eventually, he shrugged and went back to polishing the armour. 
“Must you do that here?” Arthur snapped, turning round in irritation. It didn’t seem wise to point out he was only doing it here because Arthur had told him to, cutting off his excuses of chores with the curt instruction to do them here. “You can scrub and listen at the same time, can’t you?” he’d sneered. Merlin had bitten back the retort that in private, he could scrub, polish, shine, dust and read a book.
~ Arthur cut his protest off with a glare of his own. “Yes, my respectful manservant?” He jerked his head towards the small crowd of villagers— children and old women, of course, but at least as many grown men and women— gathering a nervous distance away. “—am yours to command, my prince,” Merlin finished. He sneered, though, which helped.
~
For one beautiful moment, Merlin thought longingly of treason. Then he sighed and slumped down on the foot of Arthur’s bed to take off the prince’s boots.
~
“The floor fell in. Do you think you can climb?” “Yes.” He tried to push himself up, shifting his weight to his hands for just long enough for the agony to set in. “No.”
~
“You’re not carrying me,” said Arthur, leaning heavily on his shoulder. “You’re giving me a little support after I risked my life to save innocent young children.”
~
Merlin made a face of purest innocence. “It’s not too late to have you put to death,” Arthur said, his smile taking all the sting out of it.
~
“Okay.” Winston nods slowly, when he’s sure his jaw can take it. “You know what that was?”
Chance still doesn’t move, doesn’t respond; Winston will just go ahead and take that as breathless interest in the answer.
“That was understandable.” He nods again, firmly. “Heightened situation, you didn’t see me coming and we don’t know each other that well. And, you, you have issues with authority anyway.”
He crosses his arm and then lowers them to his sides, because he was paying attention in all those damn public relations seminars. “So you know what happens now?”
This time Chance shakes his head, that’s practically a conversation; Winston feels he’s getting somewhere. If the other man would just lower his fists, he’d even be happy about it.
“We use our words,” he says flatly. “And our first word is...?”
“Sorry.” Chance clears his throat and abruptly stands down, like he hadn’t realised he was still waiting for a fight.
~
“Yeah. No.” Chance shrugs and jams his hands in his pockets. “Kind of?”
Winston throws an old fashioned look Chance’s way. “Glad we cleared that up.”
~
“What’s a knight errant?”
“I think that means he fails a lot.”
~
“Why would he have girls’ underwear? And how would he steal it if they’re wear it?”
The two men exchanged a glance over his head. “Craftiness.”
~
“Let’s go,” chirps Pepper. She’s wearing a suit. There’s a clipboard. No good can possibly come of this.
“What.” I can’t even find the energy to make it an interrogative. Why is she here? Isn’t it after working hours? Isn’t today Saturday? Surely even Pepper must have some semblance of a social life.
~
“Just take my wallet with you. You can put it in the seat next to you, tell it to behave occasionally, and at the end of the night you take some money out of it and make a big fat donation. I bet you no one will even notice that the rest of me isn’t there.”
~
“You have one hour to get showered, shaved, and dressed,” Pepper continues, as though I haven’t spoken. She holds up a single finger, just like that, one, like I’m incapable of counting that high.
~
She slows to a stop when she sees me, which is generally the effect I have on women in this getup. Some men, too, for that matter. Occasionally also machines. “How do I look?” I ask, as if I need to be told. The word magnificent springs to mind.
~
“You’re still wearing your sunglasses,” she murmurs.
“I wondered why you looked so yellow,” I stage-whisper back. “I thought you might have jaundice.” I didn’t know it was possible to eat melon off a stick in a reproachful fashion, but somehow Pepper manages it.
~
I tip a couple more martinis down my throat in rapid succession, then retreat to the men’s room, where I take another Vicodin and ask my reflection what the hell he thinks he’s doing. I catch a snippet of sound: someone saying my name into a microphone, followed by polite applause. There was something I was supposed to do right about now, and clearly I’m not doing it.
~
“Were you seriously going to let one of those guys pick you up?” I demand. “They weren’t listening to a word you said. I bet neither of them knows how to make a decent mojito. I bet neither of those jerks could even spell mojito.”
She gapes at me for a second, like I’ve started speaking in tongues. “Glass houses,” she says finally. I can’t decide if she’s impugning my tendency to date uncomplicated women or the fact that I never listen to her. Maybe just my spelling.
~ Arthur starts talking about feasts and boots and shining and cloaks and Merlin is probably supposed to be listening because those do sound a bit like instructions, but somehow his head is all muddled up and it isn’t making sense.
~
“Those of you who disagree with the court’s decision in that case might think that the chimes of freedom that we play in this class are not pretty chimes. They are atonal chimes. Discordant, even.”
~ The rolling sensation of being carried along began to send Merlin into unconsciousness, but he forced himself to stay awake, remembering that he had a very important reason to do so. Just because he couldn’t remember it didn’t make it unimportant. Merlin let out a groan, one that he hoped conveyed ow, my legs, my arms, my head, my bones, ow, but the hulking great lummox carrying him seemed to take it as ‘yes, sire, of course, sire,’ which was not what Merlin had meant in the slightest.
~
Two days passed. Arthur avoided his father studiously with the ease of long practice. Direct summons went astray at a gold coin palmed to the guard, a wide grin and an easy wink that suggested Arthur had something better to do. His bedroom was occupied at odd hours, his servant’s serious illness blamed for everything and anything it could be remotely applied to—messages going astray, apologies unconveyed, two dinners unattended. He was going to land Merlin in the stocks again at this rate, but considering it was all his fault in the first place, Arthur saw it as appropriately petty.
~ “Yes,” Arthur said from his position on the ground, “I am aware that this is amusing, Sir Lars, but would you kindly help me up.” Three suddenly straight-faced knights lifted the leg of the wyvern off of Arthur, who stood up, muttering.
~
“Wine.” Blinking, Merlin nearly said ‘no thank you’ as imbibing while on duty typically was frowned upon before realizing Arthur was indicating that his hand was empty of a goblet and wanted some of the wine Merlin had fetched from the cellars.
~
Bliss, it was. Not that she could think much beyond that, not when she could feel herself liquefy in his hands until she was certain she resembled nothing more than a moaning puddle cradled against a wall that was most definitely a well-defined chest.
~ “This room’s larger,” Sam says, watching Dean. “And it’s a little darker. But it’s not shaped weird like the other one.” Dean lets out an exasperated breath. “I’ve got eyes, Sam.” “I’m just… reviewing,” Sam says slowly. “You’re funny-shaped. You take the funny-shaped room.”
~
“I just saw Amy Lovegood. You might know her from such films as ‘Spank Me: Volume 26’ and ‘Cheerleaders Are Easy’.” “Okay, one, I wouldn’t know her from those movies, because I’ve never seen them, and two, is this like the time you thought the janitor was Matt Damon?” “That janitor was Matt Damon.” “No, Dean, he really wasn’t.”
“I know what I saw, and Amy Lovegood is out walking her little purse dog even as we speak. And I know you saw ‘Slutty Sorority Sisters III: Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves’; don’t try to deny it.”
~ “Elizabeth Bathory bathed in the blood of virgins to stay young looking,” Sam offers doubtfully.
“Wasn’t she a vampire though? I’m pretty sure the chick I met this morning wasn’t a vampire. And what the hell is up with the virgins, anyway? Why does everybody want to kill them?”  “Seriously? This is what you’re focusing on right now?”
~ “You know, we don’t really have any proof she’s done anything wrong,” Sam says as they exit the elevator on the twenty-ninth floor. “I think looking exactly the same in 2009 as you did in 1923 is proof enough. That’s some pretty heavy mojo.” “She could be a great-granddaughter. Okay,” Sam concedes as Dean gives him his best are you shitting me? look, “she’s pretty exact, more like a clone than a great-granddaughter. But still. It is possible.”
~
“Come on, there has to be someone in this class who’s spackled a wall.”
~
“Oh God, please tell me I’m not going to have to wear a party hat. I will give up alcohol for a week—no, three days if you don’t make me wear a hat.” ~ “Where’s—” What is her name? “—Sarah?” he finished triumphantly, Neil’s brow quirking at Tony’s inappropriate enthusiasm.
~
Dawn seemed revolted by some of the stories Neil told about their time at MIT, so Tony took great pleasure in describing every detail of the time Neil got so drunk that he fell off the balcony of the Physics building and landed on Professor Brendon’s vintage Chevy.
~
“If they said that all you had to do to get that contract was come over once a month and dance under the full moon stark naked, you know you’d do it. You’d totally be thinking ‘Yes! I can be rich and naked!’”
~
‘Goddaughter, here’s my personal email, now that you’re old enough to be interesting. Don’t bother me too much.’ 
~
“I will survive without it,” he says. “Because she’s not the only thing I have. I have you.” Her teeth stop worrying her lip, but she doesn’t say anything in response. She just stares at him. For a horrible moment he’s sure that he misread the situation. “I mean, not that I have you,” he stammers. “Of course I don’t have you—”
“I’m yours,” she cuts him off.
~
He can’t say when exactly he decided to kiss her, but his lips are on hers before he has a chance to second-guess himself. Rose seems frozen for a second or two, but then her hands are buried in his hair and her lips are moving against his and he silently congratulates himself on his good decision.
~
“Do you have any idea what 16 year old guys do on a Saturday night?” The question was rhetorical, but Sam seemed compelled to reply.
“Put on make-up with girls.” The four year old was confident in his answer. “I heard you tell Dean all about it.”
“That would be making ‘out’ with girls, Runt. I should definitely be making out with a girl instead of babysitting.”
“How do you make out with a girl?” 
“Do you want me to explain the birds and the bees or save your big brother’s life?” Caleb glanced down at him. “I can’t do both.”
There wasn’t even a moment of hesitation. “Save Dean.”
~
“Dean?” Sam tugged on his brother’s cape. “Can I have your old tooth? I can take it to show and tell at daycare on Monday.” Sam stared up at the tooth as if it were a sparkling jewel. “It has blood on it and everything.”
~
“Hey, no, I was……” Dean narrowed his eyes, taking in Castiel’s too-blank expression. “Was that a joke? Did you just…..” Castiel stared blankly back, though maybe his mouth twitched. “Terrific. Sam’s off the wagon and you’re making jokes. The end really is nigh.” That got him a patented ‘you mortals are vexing’ look. It made something close to a smirk curl Dean’s lips.
~
Panel-three Dex is just flabbergasted: “What? Engage a professional to help us minimize risk and tax exposure as we transfer and apportion a large sum of money? I – I never imagined you would try to pull something like this on your own brother, Berna! YOU MONSTER!”
~
“I asked you straight out and you assured me that there were enough rose petals to spell it out… What do you mean ‘lowercase’? Who apologises in lowercase? You know, the next time I need to apologise in rose petals, I’m taking my business elsewhere.”
“Evan, have any faxes come in for me?”
“I don’t know. I barely check that machine any more; faxes are so last century.”
“Says the man apologizing via rose petals.”
~
“Oh, I forgave you two Edible Arrangements ago. I didn’t tell you because the stuff you were sending was so cute…and I kind of wanted to see what you’d come up with next.”
~
“He left? Why didn’t you stop him?”
“Um, because he’s a football coach? I couldn’t even stop a guy like that in a video game.”
~
“I didn’t get a chance to thank you for saving my arse this morning.”
“Well, everybody needs something to sit on.”
~ “If I’m distracted by your hair,” she told him flatly, “it’s because it’s so unruly that I’m looking for any rodents that have nested in it. Oh wait.” She raked her eyes up and down him and added, “I found one.”
~
From that moment, a merry chaos reigned in the room.
~
“You do know that the odds of getting hit by lightning are one in 750,000, right?”
“So, you’re saying it’s a possibility.”
~
“You sound like a teenage girl. Maybe you should be watching Twilight.”
“Seen it. Team Jacob.”
~
“He must never know that his ‘In Case of Emergency’ bag was actually useful.”
~
She is also (according to the internet, which is NEVER wrong) greatly beloved.
~ He managed to climb up the side of the hearth and into the chimney with a bit of help from magic and a lot of help from being skinny and naturally good at finding his way into small spaces.
~
Merlin has been very careful not to use magic around Arthur for anything other than essential reasons. (Saving Arthur’s life and cleaning his armour both count as essentials).
~ As it is, Arthur hasn’t explained any of the increasing complicated and thoroughly ambiguous signals he’s using, so of course Merlin gets it wrong and goes left when he should go right and zigs when he should have zagged and ends up stumbling noisily into a bog. He might possibly have flailed a little in order to keep from falling over in the bog, which is perfectly understandable because bog water smells and no one wants to fall into it. Unfortunately, the boar they’ve been stalking since the sun was facing the other way catches sight of him and goes crashing loudly away through the undergrowth, sending a flock of birds noisily into the air. Which means he’s scared off any other prey within hearing. As Arthur points out, one word at a time, jabbing his finger into Merlin’s chest to punctuate each and every word. Merlin’s going to have a finger shaped bruise there tomorrow.
~ The silence spell wears off quickly, which is a good thing as Merlin can’t actually speak to reverse it.
~
“We are not talking about what happened,” is the first thing Arthur says. “I don’t know what happened, and I don’t even want to know. And most especially, I do not want you to mention it to anyone.” Merlin doesn’t blame him. He nods agreement, relieved. And then opens his mouth. “But, you know, if we were to talk—” “Merlin!” “Okay, no talking. Understood.”
~ He makes some sort of snorting sound to emphasize his point, which Merlin thinks is overkill. And is also what finally convinces Merlin that Arthur is lying through his teeth.
~
“Why is it always hearts? Just once couldn’t we find a monster that steals, I don’t know, kittens or something?”
~
“The fact that she’s a tiny blonde woman saying this makes it racist. If it was a black guy saying it? We call that stand up.”
~ “Why don’t we disguise him?”
“That might just work.”
“We could dress him as a woman.”
“That, on the other hand...”
“We could dress him as a servant.”
~
“So, if we’re all going to die, we should have sex.” Spock looks like he’s not dignifying that with a response, his head still bent over his tricorder. Nyota smiles, not nicely. “Don’t tell me you’re afraid you’re going to die a virgin.” Jim shrugs one shoulder. “Would that work?” “No. Besides,” Spock says. “I think I might have something to say in the matter.” “I meant you, too,” Jim says. “Because that’s the kind of thing you do when you’re about to die, and your whole life is flashing in front of you—” “You’d think in your case that would keep you entertained,” Nyota says. “What are you trying to do?” “Keep morale up?” Jim suggests, but she gives him a withering look and then looks expectantly at Spock. “I am trying to transmit our location,” Spock says.
~
Spock is hunched over his console with a comm line open to engineering, saying things like “Have you tried …,” and “That should not be possible,” and “Then have you tried … I see, you have.” At intervals Spock asks him if they have permission to do something to try to fix the problem, and Jim says “Yes, do it.”  “There is a not inconsiderable element of risk involved,” Spock says about whatever the latest thing they want to do is. Jim understands what a warp core is and why it makes the ship go, and that’s about the limits of his understanding of warp propulsion physics, so he’s not wasting their increasingly precious time trying to actually understand any of the things they’re suggesting. “Do we have another option?” Jim asks. “One without a ‘not inconsiderable element of risk’?” “Not at the moment,” Spock says, sounding frustrated. “Then do it.”
~
Jim thinks he should probably put the ship on Red Alert, only they’ve already been on Red Alert four times in the last twenty minutes, the siren is really getting on everyone’s nerves, and he thinks everyone gets the picture that things are not good.
~
“It’s instinct,” he says. “All my genes want to get passed on in near-death situations.” “You realize if we’d all been blown up, any attempt to pass on your genes would have been pointless?” “It’s not a rational thing,” Jim says.
~
“Your course description states that we will learn language and culture, but 87.6% of our class time has focused exclusively on grammar,” she prods. Actually, she pulled that percentage out of her ass, but Commander Spock seems to respect numbers that end with decimal points. The strategy works. He quirks an eyebrow at her one last time, perhaps calculating the accuracy of her statistics, and then answers the question.
~
“Well,” Nyota says carefully, “when you came here, it seemed like your exposure to interstellar sexual practices was...limited. All the arrests and demerits and the foursome with the tentacle guys on my bed...” Actually, it was just a threesome, but Gaila can see how all the tentacles would have confused her. But that is so not the point of this conversation, so she continues with her story.
~
“Have I ever lied to you?” Shawn took a second to think. Gus’ eyebrow arched.
“Not about anything important,” Shawn finally conceded.
~
“If you were a human being reading this document—not a lawyer, a human being—what would you make of this clause?”
~
“I’m sorry, I know this isn’t making much sense. I promise you I haven’t been drinking, although I have plans to later tonight.”
~
“I thought I’d find a prize inside. You know, like how they put prizes inside pies?”
“That’s not a thing, Crystal.”
~
“Give me an hour and then this will be a night you’ll never forget. And if the sex doesn’t do it, we’ll steal a car or blow something up.”
~
“Sterling and I met in high school and we’ve been wrapping things in bacon on the internet ever since.”
~ Tonks,” he said, his voice weary. “I believe I’ve made myself perfectly plain—”
“And I think I’ve demonstrated that I think your reasoning is completely bollocks.”
“—and I really think your energy might be better expended—”
“S’my energy. I can do what I want with it.”
~
“I don’t know what to say.”
“A yes or no would be traditional,” he said. “Although if you’d rather throw something at me and run away screaming, I would completely understand.”
~
“If you’re about to launch into some touching show of concern about the state of my finances, you needn’t. I didn’t buy it.”
“So you’ve finally turned to a life of crime, then?”
~
“What’s your cunning plan, then?” she said.
“Nothing fancy. It’s only moderately heroic.”
~
“And you can be sure he’s trustworthy? Death Eaters won’t have turned him?”
“He’s thirteen, Mad-Eye.”
~
“I’ve got to swing downtown and talk to Justin’s naked neighbour.”
“Don’t bother finishing that story; it’s much better in my head. She’s six feet tall and her name is Chloe…”
~
“Upset? Who says I’m upset?”
“Well, for starters, when you’re upset, you start saying everything in the form of a question.”
“What? Who says I do that? Do I do that?”
~
“There’s no proof that she’s sick. There is also no proof that she’s being stalked by ninja squirrels either, but, as her boyfriend, it’s your job to make her feel better about it.”
~
“She drove my car once, just down the street where, according to Amy, there was an ‘unexpected house’.”
“You’re just jealous because I passed my test the first time.”
“You cheated! You wore a skirt.”
“No, I didn’t.”
“That works too, I guess.”
~
“For your information, Mike went on a spiritual quest about six months ago. Moved in with a group of like-minded individuals and as there have been no reports in the news about any mass suicides lately, we assume he’s doing very well.”

“Someday, I will beat you at something.”
“Aw, sweetie. Deep in your heart of hearts you don’t believe that.”
~
“Yes, I quit my job at the pet store. And, yes, I got a severance package.”
“Please don’t produce an animal. Please don’t produce an animal.”

“Have you ever seen the movie Working Girl?”
“I claim to be twenty-five so I’m going to say no.”
~
“Oh, Ms. Spencer is my transvestite brother. Call me Amy.”
~
“You’re a cuddler,” she says when she feels him stir in the morning. “Am not,” Amos denies instantly. “Then why is your arm around me?” she snuggles into Amos to prove her point. “Oh, do shut up, Maria.”  Maria thinks Amos would be more convincing if he didn’t still have his arm around her, but she decides not to mention that. She likes it, after all. It doesn’t stop her mocking though. “You’re a secret cuddler.”
~
“This is some kind of joke, right?” Maria says, because it has to be.
~
“Little sisters are never right,” Ron scoffed, “they’re just, on very rare occasions, ever so slightly less wrong!”

“So how do I word ‘How are the tests going’ in a way that really says ‘If you lie to me I’ll shave your scrotum while you sleep’?”
“You’re harsh!” Foster gasped from the doorway.
“I have six brothers,” Ginny said, plainly.
“Oh right,” Foster said, brightly, “well that explains everything.”

“Your Deluminator helped your head during an...what are we calling them?”
“Um...flashes?” Ron proposed.
“Sounds menopausal to me, how about episodes?”
“I dunno,” Ron shrugged and winced, “it makes me sound a bit...y’know?”
~ “I’m glad she’s there to keep an eye on you though.”
“Not been doing her job then,” Ron smirked as he glanced over his shoulder at his eavesdropping sister, “‘cause all she seems to do when I look at her is roll them.”

What he hadn’t planned was for the sky to open up and pour down upon him like the wrath of a vengeful god in the middle of the night, halfway to Eames’ place to gather him for a swift implementation of Plan 6C (or, as Eames referred to it, the “Well, This is Buggered” plan). Unfortunately, none of the many helpful provisions of Plan 6C had included a goddamn umbrella.

“All those in favour of dosing Arthur with NyQuil, and then sterilizing everything in the room,” Ariadne says, with a look in her eyes that Arthur takes to mean that she would not be above doing this against his will, and then drawing a dick on his face when he passes out. In Sharpie. She raises both her hands, and he doesn’t even have to look at Eames to know he has his up too.  “I hate you both,” Arthur says, as Eames pets his hair. Eames pats his back, drags his fingers in soothing circles through the coughing spell that follows. “That’s completely disgusting,” Eames tells him, when it’s finally over. He sounds pretty gleeful about it, though.

Yusuf mentally forgives Cobb for not teaching his new recruit basic IV cannulation technique, on the grounds that he was distracted by his dead wife’s habit of showing up in his dreams and shooting people.

“Ariadne,” says Saito. “Do you have a favourite hospital?” She blinks, momentarily distracted form the contractions. “I—had my appendix out at the American Hospital of Paris. They were fine.” “Excellent. I own that hospital.” “You do not,” says Eames. Saito is pulling out his phone. “I will own it by the time we arrive there,” he amends.
~
When he finally managed to unstick his tongue, all he could get out was, “Your name isn’t Arthur.” “Yours isn’t Eames,” Arthur shot back. “Oh excellent,” Mal said, delighted. “You know one another.” “When this job is over, I am going to punch you in the face,” Eames said. Mal looked significantly less delighted at that. “Fair enough,” Arthur said. He had the grace to look slightly guilty. It didn’t make Eames want to punch him in the face any less.

They’d only just begun the soup course and she was already contemplating various methods of escape, each one more improbable (and more likely to get her fired) than the last. She’d been daydreaming about elaborate diversions involving bread baskets and sonic explosives when the man sitting opposite her (Arnold? Archie? She couldn’t seem to recall) reached across the table and took her hand. 
~ A rather disturbing pattern was beginning to emerge. Or as Mickey put it: “Blimey, Rose. You’re being stalked by alien space monkeys.”

“Two.”  She eyed me very carefully. “This is extremely important, Harry.”  Uh oh.  “Is there sausage on the pizza?”
“... it’s deep dish,” I said, affronted.  Of course there was sausage.
“In that case, the three ghosts can stick it,” she said, almost cheerfully, and she settled deeper into my couch.  “Find something animated and feed me.”

The Nac Mac Feegles had a saying. Actually they had several, “Who’re you lookin’ a’?”, “Tha’ sheep oer there, tha’s ma sheep,” and “Tha couldnae find a cow’s pat wi’ aye feets, Daft Wullie,” being some of the most popular, even among those Nac Mac Feegles who had never met Daft Wullie, heard of Daft Wullie or even been accidentally set on fire by him.

It’s a simple premise really: he meets and is kind to various animals, and they help him out later in the quest. Meets a hungry raven, and gives him his bread. Meets a stranded salmon and tosses him back into the water. Meets a ravenous wolf and feeds him his horse. Wait, what? Feeds him his horse? How’s he going to—oh, then he puts the saddle on the wolf and rides it to the castle. Makes sense.

“Look, I’m just saying,” says Sam, “just because the Trickster turned out to be Gabriel doesn’t mean it was a bad plan.” “And I’m just saying that you must’ve been dropped on your head when you were a baby,” says Dean. “Seriously, it was probably a bad plan before paisley went out of fashion, that’s how fucking bad it was.”
~
“You did what?” says Dean, because honestly, he’s pretty sure he must’ve heard wrong. He must’ve heard wrong, because Sam may be epically moronic sometimes, but Dean’s pretty sure he’s not crazy. “I recruited a shape-shifter,” says Sam. OK, so Dean’s been known to be wrong. “What the fuck, Sammy, what the fuck,” says Dean, and then shakes his head. “What the fuck?” he says again, because that’s pretty much all he can think of that’s relevant to this situation.
~ “He’s the one wearing my face,” he says. “I think I’m entitled to a little antagonising.” “I’m right here, you know,” says the shape-shifter in the back seat. “Shut up,” says Dean. “No-one’s talking to you.”
~
Sam looks like he wants to argue, but then he raises his eyebrows in that thoughtful look that always means I’ve-just-had-another-really-dumb-idea-that’s-going-to-get-us-all-killed. “I have an idea,” he says.
~
“I get it, you think the plan is dumb—” “Pretty sure what I actually said was ‘have you had a frontal lobotomy?’” Dean points out.
~
“Think he really exists?” says Dean. “Why not?” says Sam. “Everything else does.” “Except unicorns,” says Dean.
~ Dean sighs. “And how’re we going to find this pagan god?” he asks, and Sam looks sheepish. “I’m pretty sure we have to pray,” he says. “There, uh. There may be dancing involved, too.” Dean glares at him. “This isn’t going to be naked dancing, is it?” he says, but Sam doesn’t meet his eyes. Dean’s never going along with one of Sam’s plans again. Just so we’re clear.
~ “Does it involve killing giants?” says Thor, and Odin shoots him a look. “What?” says Thor. “I like killing giants.” “Not giants as such,” says Sam. “But – in a different way, yes, yes it does.” Thor does a fistpump and Odin rolls his one visible eye and Dean thinks that actually, pagan gods are kind of awesome.
~
“It’s done,” he says, and Sam takes a deep breath. “How long will it take them?” he asks. “Five seconds,” says Castiel. “Four... three... two...” There’s a noise like the roar of aircraft engines, and then a stocky sandy-haired guy is standing right in front of Sam. Lucifer opens his mouth to say something else, but then there’s more with the crazy noises and Zachariah appears with two heavies behind him. Zachariah and Lucifer see each other and open their mouths, but Dean never finds out what they were going to say, because a deep voice booms out behind him. “My brothers tell me you will destroy Midgard, and Ásgard with it, and that you care not for the claims of those who came before you,” says the voice, and he doesn’t need to turn round to know it’s the voice of someone with a really impressive beard. Then there’s the sound that’s almost certainly made by a giant-ass hammer flying through the air, and Dean throws himself to the ground and closes his eyes.
~
“Fine. I’ll contact you later, when Sam is no longer inebriated and covered in…” He stares critically as if trying to discern between all the various body fluids that stain Sam’s shirt.

He cusses Dean out for waking him up so early in the morning, and then he cusses him out for not calling him soon enough.
~ “How was your date?” he asks, drunkenly sinking down into the chair next to hers. “Dating? That date you went on, with that guy, that you were all excited about going out with on that date? Was that tonight? I dunno, I mostly don’t listen when you talk about stuff like that, because, uh, Robin and her dating stories? Can you say bo-ring? Boring. Bam. I just did. But whatever. How was that? The date? Good, right? Good times were had? On that date? So you guys are like dating now? Unless you didn’t go. On the date. That you dated. To go dating. With.” He ends up with his chin in his palm, gazing raptly at her.

“You hurt her and we’ll kill you,” Sean said, his forearm pressed up against Michael’s throat.
“Not at first,” Finn added casually. “First, maybe we’ll pull out some of your teeth. Or break your fingers. Or, hell, maybe both.”
Michael tried for innocent. “I don’t know what you guys are talking about. I—”
“Fiona has mentioned you three times in the last week, mate,” Finn growled. “We’re not sodding morons.”
“We are, however, very good with knives,” Sean said.

“Hank, I love you man, but you’re out of your mind. We just watched an actual drug cartel walk in there strapped with a wide variety of guns. What we’ve got to do is call Gustafson and then high tail our asses out of here.”
“Where’s your sense of adventure?”
“I traded it in for a sense of self-preservation around the time you arrested me.” 
A scream brings their conversation to an abrupt halt. Britt eyes Hank warily. “Did that girl look willing?”
“She looked scared as hell.”
“Fuck.”
“Exactly,” Hank nods. “I’ll cover you from out here.”
“Cover me with what?”
“My natural charisma and that big ass two-by-four over there.”

~ After two days with a clear recollection of seeing the Haitian on his porch, Lyle decided to create a super secret log of events, to make sure that he wasn’t missing any memories. First, he cleaned out his internet cache extra super well, then organized his documents, then created a hidden folder inside of his “School Papers” folder. In this folder, he had three other folders, all of which were filled with random soft-core porno that he grabbed from online. The one labeled “xfro:okm” had a hidden folder inside of it, and inside that hidden folder was a password-protected zip file. He hid the password in a notepad document inside of a hidden folder inside of his Music folder, just in case. Then, he created all sorts of random hidden folders inside of most of his other folders that had names like “hot now sexy time girl”. It was a brilliant plan. So he just had to make sure that he wrote in a formatless .doc format, then label it according to his alphanumeric dating system, then put it through the encoding program he had hidden on the computer, (and he had a different encoding for each entry, because he wasn’t an idiot, and he used the alphabet in order of the qwerty system, except backwards starting from the middle row.) Then, he just dropped the entry into the zip file and closed all of the applicable folders before clearing his cache and signing off the computer. He figured that it would take his dad at least a full day to be able to get all of his files. That is, unless the Haitian decided to search through his memories to find the process. So Lyle tried to forget how he formatted the system outside of the essential parts, created secret keyboard shortcuts to help that out.

“A quarter of an hour, and you couldn’t have magicked the rest of your suit along with you?”
“Forgive me for being in a hurry to thwart the culmination of an evil plot.” Merlin rolled his eyes. “Next time I’ll be sure to stop and remember my cufflinks.” “I’ve changed my mind, you being magic is not an interesting secret at all. I wish you had turned out to be a Russian spy.”

“You look so young,” she said wonderingly.
“Vampire,” Mitchell replied, giving a sarcastic wave.

“My mum sent me to Jewish sleep-away camp every summer. From ages nine to seventeen,” he confirmed.
“How was that?” Mitchell asked.
“Same as a normal summer camp, I’d imagine. Full of sports I couldn’t play and girls who didn’t like me. Except there, the other kids could take the mickey out of me in English and Hebrew.”

“This is a disturbing conversation,” Mitchell commented. “And I say that as a vampire who has had his fair share of disturbing conversations over the years.”

Hermione frowned. “Are you saying I smell?”
“No, I’m saying you’re a girl. Girls like baths. Go.”

Hermione looked at him as though he had asked her to run a marathon. Naked. Trampling kittens as she went.
“I’m not asking,” he informed her. “Dance with me. See? No question mark. No upwards inflection to insinuate that it’s a question. Nothing of the sort. Get up.”
~
“I have to go through all of this again,” Hermione said glumly, taking a sip of her punch. “Time travel sucks.”
A wry smile formed on Tom’s lips. “I could arrange to have you killed before the ball. Send me a reminder nearer the time and you’ll be dead before light of the next day.”

“I can’t believe someone sent you a basket of dragon eggs,” she repeated instead. She sighed despondently. “I wish someone would send me a few thousand Galleons worth of Class A Non-Tradeable Goods.”

“We sleep on our backs, hands above the covers. There will be no sleeping on our sides as that could lead to another ugly spooning incident.”

She snorted. “Somehow I don’t think Blackbeard came all the way to Colorado to hide his pirate booty, Shawn.”

“We’re not going to hurt you,” Jack said, and she had a sudden, complete understanding of why that sentence was never, ever actually reassuring.
~
“It’s a baby,” Gwen said brightly, still behind her hand though her fingers hardly hid her smile.  Jack’s hand jerked away from Ianto’s shoulder as he straightened up, and he turned abruptly, putting his back to Ianto. “That’s impossible.” Owen frowned. “Yeah, because this is the place to make definitive statements about what is and is not possible, Jack.”
~
“Oh, no you don’t,” Owen said, setting down the scanner and turning away. “You make a fine coffee, Ianto, but I am not letting you jab needles into your own abdominal cavity. Now open your trousers for me, there’s a lad.”
~
“There. Mash the buttons and it goes into idiot mode,” Jack said cheerfully. “The little pictures show you what to do next.” Tosh straightened up. “You couldn’t have mentioned that sixteen hours ago?” “If you had figured it out that would have been useful information, and we had to get the hamster and let the scan run anyway. All set now?”
~ Jack reached out and touched Ianto’s right hip. “You know how you had your appendix out when you were a kid?” Ianto nodded. The memory was fairly vivid, one of the most terrifying of his life before Torchwood. “You should have a new one now. An Appendix B, actually. Time Agency standard issue, allows you to digest the fourteen most common types of non-Earth-descended proteins and three classes of processed hydrocarbons.” Ianto stared at him. “I can eat petrol?” Jack wrinkled his nose. “I don’t recommend it unless you’re starving. There’s not a condiment selection in the galaxy that makes it taste like anything but petrol. Polystyrene’s not bad, though, as long as you have a toothpick. And you’re really well equipped for a future career in smuggling,” Jack added. “But you should let me show you how to use that, if you intend to. There’s a trick to it, and it’s pretty easy to hurt yourself if you do it wrong.” Ianto covered his eyes with one hand.
~
Martha waved one hand dismissively and stood. “Just hang on one sec, I need to—” There was a sound—the sound. Ianto was on his feet at once, though he didn’t know whether he wanted to step in front of Martha or behind her. She caught his shoulder, and he held his ground at her side. The sound went on and on, louder and infinitely more immediate than the recordings he’d heard, and before him the blue box shimmered into being in the middle of Martha’s flat. As soon as the box had become fully present, the door opened, and the brown-haired man in the suit (taller than Ianto expected, even though Ianto had seen the CCTV footage of him standing with Yvonne the Terrible), the Doctor, bounded out with a smile on his face.  “Martha! Did you miss—” “You,” Martha said sternly, dropping her hand from Ianto’s shoulder to point at the Doctor, nearly jabbing him in the eye, “are early. Not a word.” The Doctor looked baffled, but shut his mouth obediently. Martha turned ostentatiously toward Ianto. “As I was saying, hang on one sec, I need to make a phone call.” Ianto glanced cautiously toward the Doctor, who looked enlightened and then eyed Ianto with cheerfully open speculation as Martha walked a little way away and dialed her phone.  “This is Martha, of course,” she said, and as Ianto watched, the Doctor mouthed the words along with her. “And I’ve got your voicemail, which means you’re either busy or screening my calls. Check the time stamp when you get this—it’s not an emergency, just some news about a mutual friend. Take your time, honestly, there’s no rush.” Martha rang off, and the Doctor said, “You over-sold it there at the end; it was that no rush business that got me a bit worried.” “So worried you couldn’t wait another ninety seconds and avoid interfering with causality?” The Doctor looked, possibly, slightly sheepish. “That’s never happened before, I swear!”
~
“Mind, I never heard any of this straight from him—I didn’t really get to talk to him directly—but Tish—” “That’s my sister,” Martha supplied, which explained precisely nothing.
~ “She, ah—after our last—she said if she didn’t get a bit of ‘me time’ someplace warm, on Earth, this year, without me around—because she insists something always goes pear-shaped when I’m there, which is obviously not true—” Martha raised her eyebrows, and Ianto could feel himself making the same face, even on the basis of his considerably less intimate knowledge. The Doctor looked back and forth between them with a very faint air of a man who knows he’s outnumbered.
~
“Go on,” the Doctor coaxed. “Say it. You have to say it, it’s a tradition.” Ianto looked around again. It had to be something about size, but he’d been spending altogether too much time with Jack for the past two years, and the array of possible rude jokes was overwhelming.
~
“He said you’re not ill, you’re hungover, so I shouldn’t bring you medicine no matter what you say, you can crawl to the loo and get it yourself.” Biting the words off carefully, one at a time, Ianto said, “Indy, your father is a sadist.” Indy shrugged, and raised his hands into Ianto’s view, one holding a small green bottle Ianto recognized from the medicine chest, the other holding a bottle of water. “I didn’t listen.” Ianto blinked. “You, on the other hand, are a Welshman and a gentleman, my son.”
~ Martha rolled her eyes. “You got terrifyingly polite. Trust me, you thanked him. But I’ll tell him again, if I see him before you do.”
~
“Don’t start by answering to anything that’s not your name,” Ianto murmured. “Sets a bad precedent with him.”

“Sure. And don’t be scared of all the other scars he’s got to keep them company,” Sam added to the sheriff as Dean pulled the sheets off of himself. “Made his career as a crash-test dummy for a while.”
“Hey, motorcycle stunt rider,” Dean enunciated carefully, peeling back the bandages over his stitches. “It had an official title.”

 ”So…what have we learned?” Anya asked as she applied a bandage to the cut on Dimitri’s forehead.
“Next time I’m chased by half of the Parisian police force I should probably avoid running smack into...Ow!” Dimitri winced as Anya yanked the bandage tightly, tying it off and glaring at him for good measure. “...No more cons?” he finished weakly.
“No more cons,” she answered sweetly.

“Right, Hatter,” his father said. “To what do I owe the momentous occasion of your visit to my study, the home of all things dull and tedious? Is this about your madcap scheme?”
“Why, Father, I am hurt that you would categorize my well-thought-out plan thusly.” Hatter plopped down in the chair in front of the desk and then hastily sat up primly. “It’s a plan of pure brilliancy and insight, one that will bring brightness and joy to people’s lives!”

~ Lois and Johnson were locking the alien in the Torchwood Secure Containment Facility 7, also known as the shed at the bottom of Rhys and Gwen’s back garden.

“Any idea what her first name is?”
“No, I think it might actually be Johnson,” Gwen replied sleepily. 
“I think her first name is Secret Agent,” Joe piped up.
~ In 2005, they watched Wales beat Ireland at the Millennium Stadium. Rhys shouted himself hoarse, and the Doctor demonstrated a surprisingly thorough knowledge of dirty rugby songs. Mickey, whose knowledge of rugby was about as comprehensive as his knowledge of quantum mechanics, was pretty much baffled throughout. Afterwards, they returned Rhys to Cardiff.
~
“The third planet was totally unfit for humanoid habitation. Human habitation, Time Lord habitation,” the Doctor gave Rhys a look. “Even Welsh habitation.”
Rhys rolled his eyes. “You’re pretty funny for a bloke I just saved from getting blown up by an alien midget.”
~
On the seventh coalition planet the Doctor announced himself as The Last of the Time Lords. The immediate result of this was that the natives strung the three of them upside down by their ankles. The Doctor had a go at undoing his manacles, but they’d taken his sonic screwdriver from him and Time Lord or not, there was little he could do against solid iron with his bare hands. Meanwhile, Mickey and Rhys were talking about what any two red blood males would talk about when hanging upside down from the ceiling of an alien prison: woman troubles.
“…And she always said she couldn’t talk about it so I thought that it was the terrorism squad, as you would. Next thing it turns out that she’s not even in the police anymore. Instead she’s working for this annoyingly good looking American lunatic, catching aliens.”
“At least your girlfriend only arrests aliens; mine chucked me and ran off with one.”
With a renewed sense of purpose the Doctor threw himself upwards and caught hold of his chains. He was going to get out of this dungeon if it was the last thing he did, and he might even consider taking Rhys and Mickey with him.

“How do you know?” she demanded. “How do you always know when I’m hungover to call me at the crack of dawn?”
“I’m psychic. And you left me a voicemail at four in the morning saying that you’d rather have me than any pretty Frenchman who couldn’t sit on a horse even when it was standing still…?” 
Morgana could practically hear the raised eyebrow. “It’s true. I don’t have a word of French and I hate horses.”
~ “I’m going to kill Uther Pendragon, I’m going to kill him with a staple-remover through the eye and then I’m going to hide his body behind the photocopier, so you’ll need to give me an alibi.”
“Er, this is Gwen. Morgana left her mobile on the desk when she went to look for a book. And we’re in the library, she must have forgotten to switch it to silent.”
“Oh. When she gets back tell her Morgause called, would you?”
“Any message?”
“Staple-remover. Photocopier. Alibi. She’ll know what I mean.”
~ “You look…” Arthur squinted at her. A maid had done something with her hair, and she was wearing a dress of… some description. “You look like a girl.”
~
After Lancelot leaves the second time, Arthur suggests Gwen get a flatmate to keep her company and Merlin suggests she gets a cat. Gwen gets a Morgana, who is a human flatmate and not a cat, not that it’s always easy to tell from all the time she spends sleeping on the couch and the amount of hair she sheds in the bathroom.
~ “If I die, I want you to use this password to get into my account and tweet “So this is what it’s like being a ghost”.”
~
“Dammit Hardison. If I could get up to that floor without setting off the alarms I would come up there and beat some paranoia into you. Just get the hell down here, and if he causes any trouble your code word is Mexico.”
“What am I supposed to do, just slip that casually into conversation?”
~
“What do you want for Christmas?”
“A clause in my contract that says I never again have to be a passenger in any vehicle driven or piloted by you.”
~
“You can tell they were made with a lot of love,” said Pepper tactfully.
~ “I was going to bake you a cake with a file in it,” he says, this time. “But I don’t know how to bake a cake.”
“Betty Crocker mix,” Britt says, resting his elbow on the table and his chin on his hand. “Don’t buy it with your credit card, though. Too suspicious. You can’t break me out if you get busted trying.”
~
“Hey, Sam.  Why do pirate kids always have trouble learning the alphabet?” “Jesus God.”  Sam cast his remaining eye upwards in supplication. “Because their fathers insist that there are seven C’s.”
“It’s never going to stop, is it?”
~
“Tulips.” Jeremy looked a bit rumpled, but also smug. “She told Louise ages ago that she loves tulips, and Louise told me. But Natalie thinks it was some kind of boyfriend telepathy; you won’t ruin this for me, will you?”
~
“Shit. Sammy’s going to be sooo pissed. ‘Way to go Dean. Look what you managed to do Dean. Looks like you’re catching up Dean.’ I’ll show you who gets kidnapped more often ya little...”
~
“Are you shorter?” Sam asks, stopping to catch his breath, hands on knees, and scrutinizing his brother.  Dean’s gaze shifts back and forth, searching for some way to tell and coming up with nothing. “I don’t feel shorter,” he answers helpfully.
~
“Holy photographic memory, Batman.”
“If you couldn’t recite half the Bible verbatim back when I was human, you were in pretty imminent danger of being burned as a witch. I learned damn quick.”
~
Sam only had eyes for the sword. Dean could not blame him because the blade was suddenly on fire, burning as cheerfully as a bar of magnesium.
~
“The man changed the face of ballroom dancing…and then a few things about his own face. All I’m saying that teeth shouldn’t glow in the dark, people.”
~
Nate was finalising the details, studying a list of employees, when Eliot cleared his throat pointedly. Barely glancing up at him, Nate said in a pointed tone, “No.”
~
“Seriously?” the Hitter demanded, “You think Eliot Spencer is my real name?”
~
“No. Okay, yes, one time. But no. I had other places to be so I ... left.”
“You escaped,” translated Nate, with a more speculative expression. “So you shouldn’t have any problem doing it again.”
“That was a whole other circumstance and there was this monkey, which—never mind, it doesn’t matter ‘cause I’m not doing it.”
~
“Hey, it’s no big deal. You been picked up before, right? Hell, Nate got you, what, three times? You should be used to it.”
Eliot stared at him. “Never try and make anyone feel better. About anything. Ever again.”
Alec considered and then acknowledged, “No, that’s fair.”
~
The man’s colour rose. “I mean for you. It’s dangerous for you. I could just get myself thrown in solitary. No one could get me there.”
A play by play of exactly how someone could kill him while he was in solitary probably wouldn’t be a comfort so Eliot just said, “That’s Plan B, okay?”
~
“Eliot could run the team,” Parker said, slightly too loudly.
Eliot shook his head. “No.”
Parker frowned and poked him. “Stop saying no.”
Eliot tilted his head back to look at her, paused for a pointed two seconds and then said, “No.” 
~
“Did you bring cereal?” Hardison blinks as if that wasn’t the question he was expecting. She gets that look a lot; she ignores it.
~
On the other hand, the man looked more sheepish than dangerous. His hands moved as he sketched vaguely in the air. “There was a thing, and then there was another thing, and Spencer—Eliot—asked me to sub in while he’s taking care of….”
“Let me guess: things,” Nate finished dryly. “Eliot Spencer—the guy who tried to kill you or … you tried to kill … whatever—Eliot asked you to play substitute, and you came?”
“Well ‘asked’ may be a little strong,” the man admitted. “He said if anything happened to the team – your team, I guess—because of this completely unavoidable thing, he’d come after me and everything I ever loved.”
A slightly self-mocking smile appeared. “And I really love my sofa. It’s worn just right.”
~
“I thought that might be a problem, so I brought references. You know Marty Jacobs?” Nate nodded. “He hates me,” Chance said with complete sincerity. “I think he has a dartboard with my picture on it. And Paulie Franze? Still tries to kill me at least once a year.”
“Traditionally, references are from reputable people you would expect to trust.”
Chance smiled crookedly. “You trust anyone, Mr Ford?”
Nate waved a finger as he considered; no one was coming immediately to mind, not even himself. “You have a point,” he conceded.
~
Nate shook the offered hand; it was callused in ways he’d come to associate with people who handled guns. A lot.
~
Three explosions, a sprinkler malfunction and a hail of bullets later, Hardison begrudgingly admitted that Chance had been useful, and maybe even nearly as good as Eliot, and way more understanding when someone – for example – screamed like a girl and accidentally hit him with a rebar.
~
“Don’t break his heart.” Ariadne looks up from her book at Cobb who is looking decidedly uncomfortable. “Shouldn’t you be having this conversation with Arthur? That’s the traditional way these things go.” “We’re not really traditional,” Cobb says and when Ariadne nods with a half-smile he adds, “You’re tougher than you look.” Cobb hovers, looking more constipated by the second and Ariadne bites her lip to stop from outright grinning. “Did you want me to sign something?” “No, of course not. I mean...” Cobb actually looks like he contemplates the idea for a second before he shakes his head briskly. “No, don’t be ridiculous.”
~
He ended up giving Alice the short version while making himself some tea: boy learns how to get people to confide in him, boy learns to sell their secrets, boy gets in over his head, boy has a sense of fucking professionalism and doesn’t tell the pricks valuable information for free, boy escapes, boy continues to collect secrets, is still occasionally accosted by people with a deficient sense of business acumen, but also grows up, gains a mean right hook and the apparent backing of the government, and thus the ability to explain to said pricks where to shove it without consequence, yet still gets all twitchy at the merest hint of the possibility that he might be tied to a chair.
~
She gulps down a handful of cheese-dusted popcorn and laughs with her mouth halfway open.
“You’re the perfect woman,” Hatter tells her sincerely. She stares at him sideways in suspiciously pleased surprise, settles against him, kisses him with faintly orange lips. He rests his chin on top of her head, pets her hair, leans down to murmur into her ear. “It’s an unexpected bonus that you’re cheddar-flavored.”
~
“Yes, exactly.” Castiel seems utterly satisfied with their response. Like, weirdly and completely satisfied. The kind of satisfaction that Dean has only known once (Ribfest ‘06, hot little waitress in even hotter pants. All you can eat ribs. All you can drink beer). It’s kind of creepy.
~
“I could just turn you in and you’d go to jail. Are you a cuddler, Cameron? You look cuddly.”
“Well, not in a jail-y kind of way.”
~
“I could really use a hug,” he said dejectedly. 
“Yeah, and I’d rather not be put into a sleeper hold.”
“Good! You’re learning! Never touch me.”
~
“Here: my bridesmaid dress. To be fitted.”
“I’ll learn to sew.”
“Or call the tailor.”
~
“If you see anyone insanely tall with annoying girly hair that’s Sam. Don’t shoot him. Shoot anyone who isn’t tied to a table!” Dean shouts off somewhere to his right. “And, me, don’t shoot me!”
~
“We could try again,” said Neal. Peter tried to convey his deep, deep disapproval of this idea using only the muscles of his face. “Or we could sit very still for a while,” said Neal. Peter closed his eyes. “See, we understand each other.” ~
“Do you know his number?”
Lestrade snorted. “He put it in my phone. I tried to delete it once, but it reappeared.”
~
“So let me get this straight,” he says, with infinite patience. “The CEO was actually some kind of… thing, wearing the real CEO’s body—”
“Yes, sir,” Sam says nervously. “A fiend, sir.”
“A fiend,” Peter deadpans. “Of course. How could I have missed that?”
Sam looks, if possible, even more awkward.
“A fiend,” Peter repeats, like he’s testing the word out. “Which you killed with… a water balloon.”
“A holy water balloon,” Sam corrects.
Peter gives himself a minute to digest that. “A holy water balloon.”
“Yessir.”
~
“Also?” Lis says, trying not to laugh, “I think, in order to still be cool, you do have to have actually been cool in the first place, so…”
“I was totally cool,” Peter mutters. “Some time. Maybe in college. For at least a month.”
~
“You know, the last time I saw you, you ate too much ice cream and threw up all over my husband’s shoulder.”
Lois’s eyes flicked to the side and back. “If this doesn’t turn out to be an embarrassing baby story, I can only apologize unreservedly and assure you I no longer drink tequila.”
~
“This is an orchard. There must be a ladder somewhere.”
Above him, Lois chimed, “A reasonable, yet erroneous, assumption.”
~
The intelligence is always awake, ‘THERE ARE AS MANY DEREKS AS THERE ARE POSSIBLE FUTURES.’ John knuckles sleep out of his eyes. “That’s a lot,” he says out loud. ‘INFINITY IS A LOT,’ says the intelligence.
~
‘CALL ME ISHMAEL,’ says the screen.  “That’s ridiculous,” he says. ~
“And how are you going to get me an exclusive with Bruce Wayne?” she asked. “I have my ways,” he replied. Batman’s ways, Lois was fairly sure, mostly involved dangling people off high buildings and over highways. Clark had assured her that this wasn’t (always) true, but he had been doing that thing he did when he lied where he wouldn’t look her straight in the eye.  “What if I don’t want an interview with Bruce Wayne?” she said. “You will,” he replied. “Rumor has it he’s about to do something very scandalous.”
~
Lois didn’t need her killer reporter instincts to find Superboy. There was only one rule for tracking a missing superhero: follow the destruction.
~
Superboy needed a name, if only for a few days. She couldn’t take him to the Planet without one—I’m sorry, my religion forbids me from telling you that unless we are to be wed, in which case you’ll owe Ms. Lane twenty-seven goats wasn’t an excuse that was going to fly in a building full of reporters.
~
The interview ended with shouting, armed guards and several broken computers. Conner took it all in stride. “Is this how interviews normally go?” he asked, looking bemused, as he threw a desk at their pursuers.
~
“What are you dragging Conner into?” he asked Lois.  “I like journalism,” Conner protested. “There’s a lot more punching things than I expected.”
~
Arthur squinted as he studied his opponent. “He’s bigger than me.”
“Slower,” said Merlin.
“Longer reach,” said Arthur.
A trumpet sounded. “Stop fussing,” said Merlin, and gave Arthur’s shoulder another pat. “Go win.”
~
Johnny made a face. “I mean,” he said. “I could. Go out, go to a club, find some girl. But I don’t really want to.”
“Oh my God,” Peter said. “You’ve been replaced by pod people, haven’t you? Is there an invasion? Should I be getting changed? I brought my tights.”
“You did not seriously,” Johnny said. Peter had, actually, at the bottom of his backpack, because he was a believer in basic hero math: when two heroes got together, a supervillain attack was infinitely more likely to go down. He decided not to mention that.
~
“Your problem, Arthur, is that you have no imagination,” Eames tells him. “You have to get by on being ruthlessly competent instead. It’s terrible.” He’s slurring, just the tiniest bit, the only clue that he’s drunk four gin martinis.
~
As he peels out of the garage and onto the street, Arthur asks, “What did you want to be when you grew up?”
“A dinosaur,” Eames replies, with no hesitation at all. He’s checking behind them, to see if they’re being pursued. “Adulthood didn’t really seem that appealing,” he adds. “It definitely didn’t have the obvious benefits of being a velociraptor.”
~
“Mum, this is Arthur,” Eames says, with almost no inflection in the words.
“I see,” Mrs. Eames says, with plenty of it. “Well, it’s a pleasure to finally meet you.”
“Likewise,” Arthur says smoothly.
“Finally?” Arthur whispers to Eames, while his mother is taking her coat off.
‘Fuck off,’ Eames mouths silently.
“Language!” Mrs. Eames calls, and Eames grimaces.
~
Over a dinner of baked ziti, she asks her son a number of probing questions, most of which Eames dodges. “How’s work these days?” she asks, finishing off her glass of wine.
“Probably something you’d still rather stay ignorant of,” Eames answers.
Mrs. Eames snorts. “At least you’re not telling me you work for the MI6 anymore. You would not believe the things he used to tell me,” she says to Arthur. “Something different every week. ‘I work for MI6, Mom, I joined the SAS, I’m an art thief, I’m a spy, on and on and on. Now he just tells me–”
“That it’s best for her to have plausible deniability,” Eames says. Arthur’s having trouble keeping a straight face.
Eames mother rolls her eyes. “It’s a real comfort, you can imagine.” She leans forward, brushes Eames’ bangs off his forehead, and asks: “You would tell me if you were a gigolo, wouldn’t you, honey?”
“Ugh, Mom, stop it,” he says, batting her away.
“Because if you are, can you recommend a good escort agency up in Leeds? Your mother’s got needs after all–”
Eames puts his hands over his ears and bellows the lyrics to “Rocky Raccoon”. “OH ROCKY RACCOON, STEPPED INTO HIS ROOM, ONLY TO FIND GIDEON’S BIBLE.”
“IT’S NOT SO EASY TO GET ANY ACTION THESE DAYS–” she shouts over him.
“GIDEON STEPPED OUT, LEAVING NO DOUBT–”
“WHAT WITH THE MENOPAUSE AND EVERYTHING,” Mrs. Eames crows gleefully.
“God, must you be so mortifying?” Eames says. He glares at Arthur, who is in tears with laughter. 
~
“You were staring,” Arthur says flatly.
“Merely resting my eyes on the most attractive object in the room,” she replies. 
~
“Why not? Very popular car. Very inconspicuous. Passed all sorts of safety tests, I’d’ve thought you’d approve of that.” Eames grins. “And very nippy in car parks.” “Nippy,” Arthur says. “Good quality in a car.” “I’d always figured you as the James Bond car type.” “Oh. Well, yeah,” says Eames. “My other car has water skis.” The indicators click as he overtakes someone doing fifty on the inside lane. “But I crashed it into a sperm whale.” “My commiserations.”
~
“You’re not in deep disguise, on the run from armed governmental and/or criminal organisations are you?” Eames says. “Because I’ll still help you out, for a fee, but I like to know whether or not to plan for shootouts at breakfast and so forth.”
~ “This is a ridiculous car,” Arthur says. “It’s ordinary,” Eames says patiently. “That’s the point.”
~
“Is this something you do often? And by this I mean hitchhiking, not changing the subject or inflicting moody silence upon your fellow human beings.”
~
“By the laws of Narnia I ask if there is anything that can be done to ease your passage into Aslan’s country, or whatever afterlife your faith dictates.” “You could die,” said the man who had tried and failed to kill the High King of Narnia. “I am not, however,” the High King continued, “obliged to carry out your requests. Do you have any last words before I execute the sentence?”
~
“My name is Professor Benjamin Adams. You may call me Ben. Or Adams. Or basically anything that isn’t somehow in reference to my rather substantially sized nose.”

“Today people carve jack-o-lanterns to ward away spirits like Jack. And because no one really knows what else to do with pumpkins. Don’t tell me pies. I’ve seen people bake pumpkin pies. Pumpkin pies are made from canned goop.”
~
“But you don’t understand! This is Arthur Pendragon, Prince of Camelot!” She shrugged. As if mortal names or titles meant anything to her. “You know who I am, correct?” She rolled her eyes and leveled a stare at him that spoke volumes. “Well then you know what my destiny is! To protect and guide the Once and Future King so that magic can be restored to Camelot and all of Albion united under one peaceful rule!” A tiny, delicate eyebrow arched. Merlin rolled his eyes and waved a hand at the pile of chainmail. “Well how many future kings do you think I know?” She blinked. Then looked down at the chainmail. Then looked up and blinked again. This time, the wince was hers. A tentative tinkling chime filled the air. “Exactly! This one is the one! Now bring him back.” Eye contact was suddenly hard for the Fairy Queen to make. She scuffed her petal slipper on the air beneath her and wrung her hands in front of her. Merlin understood very well what she said next, but his brain wasn’t quite ready to accept it. “What do you mean you can’t fix him? You have to! Bring him back!”
~
The next moment a dark-haired man in a smart suit stumbled into existence only metres away, looking rather dazed. “What was that?” he demanded of the sky, in a British accent. “‘Help them?’ What kind of instruction is that? Haven’t you ever heard of details?”
~
“I’m going to kill them,” Ariadne said flatly when the line finally picked up. “They’re dead men. Yusuf’s pretty confident he’s planned the perfect murder and Saito’s promised to cover the legal fees just in case, so I thought you’d like the chance to say your goodbyes.” Silence. “Dom?”
A high-pitched, definitely-not-Dom voice called out, “Daddy, it’s for you!”
Ariadne winced at the volume and weakly sweetened her tone. “Hey, Philippa.”
Philippa wasn’t listening; Ariadne heard rustling, clicking and a muffled, “Ariadne’s killed someone!” She let her head drop forehead-first onto the desk, but kept the receiver at her ear.
A moment later, Dom came on the line. “Ariadne?”
“Hey, Dom,” she said into the varnish. “School holidays, huh?”
“Yeah, you know. Kids. School.”  A beat, and then he spoke with studied nonchalance. “So Philippa says you … killed someone?”
Ariadne could hear the effort it was taking Cobb to be calm and non-judgmental, and took pity before, like the good, experienced friend he was, he started recommending ways to flee the country. “No, I said I was going to kill someone. Actually, someones.” Then, she frowned. “Wait, you think I could kill someone?”
~
“Look, there has to be someone out there you’d recommend who doesn’t want to kill any of us and isn’t prone to falling off balconies.”
“He fell off a balcony?” Cobb tried to imagine the sequence of events that would like to someone falling off the balcony of a single-story, window-free warehouse.
“Or down some stairs,” Arthur said off-handedly. “Depends who you ask.”
“I’m asking you,” Cobb said levelly.
Arthur shrugged. “Guy that accident prone, he probably tripped over his own shoelaces. He spilled coffee … he knocked over models. Hell, he nearly knocked Ariadne under a bus.”
Uh huh. “So what you’re saying is, it was Eames in the library with the candlestick.”
~
Tad swallowed. “Sam, please…” And then he threw the shovel at Sam and lunged after it. A rock-salt load from a dozen feet away wouldn’t kill a person, but hitting center-mass of Tad’s back, it was enough to bring him down cold at Sam’s feet. Sam ducked the shovel but otherwise didn’t even have to move.
He peered up at Dean with a frown. “Dude, I had him.”
“Dude, he had a shovel,” Dean called back. Not to mention there was the whole protective big-brother thing. “Deal with it.”
~
“I’d like a hug,” he mumbles, very quickly, trying to ignore the heat he can feel spreading over his face. And then, in panic, “from you,” Just in case Dean needs the clarification. There’s a silence, a couple beats for Dean to just stare at Sam in bewilderment, his arms notably still right by his sides, and then he says, “I’d like a brother who isn’t a huge girl.” That gets Sam to lift his head again, and he puts all his years of pissed-off little brother experience into his scowl. “Listen,” he says, “I’ve had a very hard—five years or so. And I put up with your stupid, frequently nearly-dying ass all the time. The least you can do—” “Jesus Christ, Shut up. I didn’t say no.” Dean shuffles forward, slow and cautious, scratching the back of his neck with one hand, like maybe he’s approaching a nest of rats instead of his brother. When he gets to Sam, he stops, looks up at him very earnestly. “I’m still giving you time to let us off the hook for this,” he says, but he tugs Sam in before Sam can answer, wraps both arms around him and squeezes, his hands splaying warm and strong against Sam’s back.

“Robbie! Mind your manners.”

“I may agree with your sentiments, but I very much disapprove of your way of expressing them,” Mama told him. “He is your uncle and you should be polite when you speak of him.”

“My name,” said Locke, “is Lukas Fehrwight.” The voice was clipped and precise, scrubbed of Locke’s natural inflections. He layered the hint of a harsh Vadran accent atop a slight mingling of his native Camorri dialect like a barkeep mixing liquors. “I am dumb enough to walk around without a blade of any sort. Also,” he said with a hint of ponderous regret, “I am entirely fictional.”

Don Salvara could now see that his clothes were very fine, despite their spattering of muck and their unreasonable weight—excellently cut, form-tailored, and ornamented with expensive subtlety rather than opulent flash.

Don Salvara bowed correctly but casually, then stepped forward to shake the newcomer’s hand; this signalled his permission to deduct any superfluous bowing and scraping from the ensuing conversation.

“Ten for the cask. One more for forgetting about this, hmm?”
“Holy hell, my memory must be cacked out, because I can’t remember what you’re paying me for.”

There was a series of noises from inside the cask that sounded vaguely like some sort of protest.

“The only person who gets away with Locke Lamora games is Locke Lamora because we think the gods are saving him up for a really big death. Something with knives and hot irons and fifty thousand cheering spectators.”

If the done was wise to this, the game might be blown. Conte might be trying to pin Locke to the table with his daggers in just a few seconds. And then Jean would pull out the hatchets he had concealed down the back of his vest, and everyone in the little group beneath the silk awning would get very, very uncomfortable.

“Fuckdamn,” he said, totally unable to help himself when the sums involved vanished over his mental horizon. “Beg pardon, Dona Sofia.”
“You should.” She drained her snifter in one quick unladylike gulp. “Your calculations are off. This merits a triple fuckdamn at least.”

Scholars of Therin Collegium, from their comfortable position well inland, could tell you that the wolf sharks of the Iron Sea are beautiful and fascinating creatures, their bodies more packed with muscle than any bull, their abrasive hide streaked with every colour from old-copper green to stormcloud black. Anyone actually working the waterfront in Camorr and on the nearby coast could tell you that wolf sharks are big aggressive bastards that like to jump.

“Maybe we could have her back a little less crazy, though.” Said one of the Sanzas, who Locke mentally labelled Calo for convenience.
“And humble.” Galdo nodded after he said this. “Humble would be great.”
“The brothers Sanza wish her well.” Chains held the glass of liquor rock steady and eyed the twins. “And they pray for her safe return.”
“Yes! Wish her well!”
“Safe return, that would be really great!”

“Exactly where you left it,” said one of the Stanzas.
“And not burned down or anything,” said the other.
“If you boys can burn down stone and Elderglass, the gods have higher aspirations for you than a place as my apprentices. Do behave.”
~ The Last Mistake was a place where the underworld of Camorr bubbled to the surface; a flat-out crook’s tavern, where people of every sort could drink and speak freely of their business, where respectable citizens stood out like serpents in a nursery and were quickly escorted out the door by mean-looking, thick-armed men with very small imaginations. 
~
“Rejoice!” cried Calo as he appeared in the kitchen. “The Sanza brothers have returned!”
“I do wonder,” said Jean, “if that particular combination of words has ever been uttered by anyone, before now.”
~
“No trouble now. Crossbow bolts cost money. Shame to waste them on the likes of you.”
~
“Papa’s in a mood.” There was a muffled scream from behind the doors that led to the inner chambers of the Floating Grave, followed by the faint murmur of raised voices—shouts, cursing, another scream.
~
“You think I’m inclined to walk in on a day like today and deliberately twist his breeches? If your father says ‘bark like a dog,’ I say ‘What breed, your Honour?’”
~
‘Let’s start the wobbling, shall we?’ said Locke’s knees, but this offer was met by a counterproposal from his better judgment to simply freeze up and do nothing, like a man treading water who sees a tall black fin coming straight at him.
~
“Pack up, lads. Our business here is finished so let’s quit bothering the nice men with the crossbows.”
~
“Beer and apricot tarts! A combination so disgusting I feel oddly compelled to actually try it.”
~ His pen-scratchings grew smoother step by halting step until the Sanza brothers announced that he no longer wrote “like a down with an arrow in its brain.”
~
“Steal a corpse? This won’t be any fun,” said Galdo.
“Think of it as a valuable test of your skills,” said Chains.
“Are we likely to steal many corpses in the future?” asked Calo.
~
“That’s easy. One night a powerful sorcerer knocks on the door of a less-powerful sorcerer. ‘I’m starting an exclusive guild,’ he says. ‘Join me now or I’ll blast you out of your boots right where you stand.’ So naturally, the second mage says, ‘You know, I’ve always wanted to join a guild!’”
~
It was the easy way to learn the language. They would chat about any subject on the old man’s mind, and he would fastidiously correct every consonant that was too short and every vowel that was too long. He would also get steadily more red-faced and belligerent as each session went on, for Chains paid him in wine for his services. 
~
“My client is otherwise occupied, and I will bear your words to him. Assuming you have any.”
“I always have words. Words like ‘complete lunatic.’ And ‘fucking idiot.’”
~
“Those that want a redhead in general have their fun and go their way. But you…you want one redhead in particular. And I’m not her.”
“I’m sorry. I said it’s not your fault.”
“I know. That’s ever so gracious of you.”
“And I’m happy paying anyways.”
“And that’s also sweet. But you’d be taking it up with the room full of armed men if you didn’t, not just worrying about hurting my poor feelings.”
“You know, I think I prefer you like this to all that ‘how may I please you master’ bullshit earlier.”
~
“Jean,” he gasped out during a brief lull between spasms of retching, “next time I conceive a plan like this, consider planting a hatchet in my skull.”
“Hardly efficacious.” Jean swapped a full bucket for an empty one and gave Locke a friendly pat on the back. “Dulling my nice sharp blades on a skull as thick as yours…”
~
“I can’t wait to have words with him when this shit is all finished. There’s a few things I want to ask him. Philosophical questions. Like, ‘How does it feel to be dangled out a window by a rope tied around your balls, motherfucker?’”
~ Then there was a torrent of polysyllabic blasphemy from four mouths; exactly who said what would never be clearly recalled.
~
“But you didn’t die.”
“Clever lad, to deduce that from such slender evidence after living with me for just three years.”
~
“It’s not natural. Not natural at all; salt devils don’t act like this.”
“Oh good. You can discuss it with them. After they devour us.”
~
“What’s with the ‘u’ in parlour anyway? We’re in America, man.”
“That ‘u’ is what gives us class. Distinguishes us from the tattoo parlour down the street that sells crack.”
~
“Oh, here comes Alexis. Question: Who is the hottest girl in Venice?”
“Answer: my wife, because I love her and she has ears everywhere.”
~
“Alex is amazing. She keeps it real, man. I bet she brushes her teeth with a stick. I bet she makes her own flip-flops out of dreams.”
“How high are you?”
“Not at all, man. But, just look at her! It’s like she knows stuff we don’t know, like does god exist or is wrestling real. How do I look?”
“Well, you know how I feel about the ponytail…I know, I know, it has half your personality—”
“All my personality.”
“Well, at least it’s back to its original colour. I’m telling you that pink—”
~
“This is like a party God would throw. I guess he does exist.”
~
“You can’t leave now! You leave now and you’re a douche. And you’re already a douche, so that’s douche squared. And when you square something, you don’t just times it by two, you multiply it by itself. It’s douche times douche.”
~
“Just make sure my witness shows up safe and sound at trial.”
“Safe and sound? Is that a new thing? No ‘or’ in there?”
~
“I know my alcoholism meant that I missed a lot. That I wasn’t there for you. Your prom, your sweet sixteen—”
“I never wanted a sweet sixteen. I wanted a bottle of vodka, and you got that for me.”
~
“Were you thinking about how to steal that?”
“It weighs two tons and is worth maybe a couple of thousand dollars.”
“But you were thinking about how to steal it.”
“Involuntary reflex.”
~
“Three steps to your left, Mozzie. And hold your arms up as high as you can.”
“Is that a short joke?”
“It is now.”
~
“Why are you removing the nametag from my door?”
“My supervisor issued a work order.”
“Why did he issue the work order?”
“If I knew that, I’d be his supervisor.”
~
“Do we have a plan here?”
“Well, I have some tactical goals and a rough approach…”
~
“Hey, it’s a sidewalk…walk! There are only three good reasons to run: cops, lions, and…”
“Angry hookers who won’t accept cheques.”
~
“Dude, I need a woman. I can’t sit through another ‘it’s ok if you’re gay’ conversation with my parents”
~
“If I got a new set of boobs, he’d be all over me. But they’re super expensive. And you gotta get two of them.”
~
“What’s Japanese for ‘Drop your weapons’?”
“I think it’s something like this.” Jesse cocked the gun threateningly. 
~
“Jill sent you a postcard?”
“No, she sent it to you.”
“Then why are you reading it?”
“Dude, it’s a postcard. If she wanted privacy, she should have sprung for an envelope.”
~
“About 250 grand of midlife crisis came straight at me, and I had to swerve.”
~
“My policy has always been that it’s better to live in poverty and in love, than not and spend a fortune on divorce attorneys.”
~
“Did you see the bay doors overlooking the backyard? It’s like a giant movie screen of nature.”
“Forget that. Did you see the lawn in the backyard? I can finally get my lawnmower and pay a neighbour boy to use it.”
~
“Why don’t you just be a man about it and put your foot down?”
“Ha. You have so clearly never been married, it’s cute.”
~
“From the piercing cries that just began to emanate from the nursery, I should judge that someone has spilt boiling water on a lio, or Edward has frightened one of the maids, or Laurence has woken up from his nap. The only thing that rules out the possibility of all three is the happy circumstance that we do not own a lion. 
~
“Georgiana is an utter goose, but if she wishes her whereabouts to remain unknown to anyone, I shall oblige her.”
~
“Cecelia, I do not wish to say anything invidious about your aunt, but–”
“It is quite all right,” I assured him. “You cannot say anything that I have not said myself already at least a dozen times.”
James snorted. “I believe I could manage one or two things.”
“Well, perhaps, if you use the sort of vulgar language that is permitted to gentlemen but not to ladies,” I allowed. “But I think that is taking unfair advantage.”
~
“Are you taking any medication, Sir? Can you tell me what type?”
“Sure. They’re yellow.”
~
“From one to ten, ten being unbrearable: how bad is the pain?”
“I can’t count that high.”
~
“I can’t wiggle my fingers. Pins and needles…only sharp pins and jagged needles…”
~
“She’s not your type.”
Joey grinned. “I thought you said she was a girl.”
~
“I am Cosmic Traveller,” he announced, and then paused as if awaiting fanfare. Asta and Tom stared at him, fascinated. “That ridiculous little man has sent me here to ascertain the whereabouts of our captors, and to inform you that he is concocting some, no doubt highly unworkable and highly dangerous, escape plan.”
~
They were scrambling around up in the rigging, agile as spiders, and casually cursing each other in English, French, Italian and a couple of languages Chandagnac has never heard, and though their grammar was atrocious he had to concede that, in terms of obscenity, blasphemy and elaborate insult, the pirates got the most out of every language he was able to understand. 
~
But she just laughed drunkenly and mumbled something in a slurred mix of French and Italian; Chandagnac was pretty sure it had been a half-sarcastic sexual invitation, but the slang was too unfamiliar, and the tenses too garbled, for him to be certain. 
~
The burly old man stared at Hodge in disbelief; then as if explaining something to a child, he pointed at the no longer distant sails and said distinctly, “Henry—it’s the bleeding Royal Navy.”
Hodge turned on him angrily. “And we’re in action, Isaac, and I’m the captain here today, and Davies’ quartermaster besides. God’s blood man, do you think I like these orders? The hunsi kanzo will have us all for zombies if we back off now—but in going on, all we risk is death.” To Shandy’s uneasy surprise, the crew found this logic unfortunate, but unassailable, and they set about preparing for combat.
~
“So what if he can tell when someone is lying? Every nun I ever knew could do that. Heck, Sister Mary Francis could even tell when you were about to lie.”
~
“Artie, the kid’s got no sense of humour. He doesn’t laugh at the jokes.”
“Your jokes, Pete? Give that a little more thought.”
~
“Come on, you’re an expert on the bird of Avon.”
“The bard, Pete. That’s Bard of Avon.”
“See? You’re helping already! If you needed help on anything that involved football or porn, you know I’d help you.”
~
“The lost folio…how do you lose a folio? What’s a folio, anyway?”
“A book.”
“Well, why not just say ‘a book’?”
~
“Alright, let’s get out of here. These plants are making me nervous and I think that one is staring at me.”
~
“She puts the ‘hell’ in Helen.”
~
“Hey, Dad’s birthday is next week; want to go halvsies on a gift with me?”
“By which you mean research it, buy it, wrap it and deliver it?”
“Yup. So wanna go halvsies with me?”
~
“Toe-sucking is called shrimping. Did you know that?”
“See, this is everything that’s wrong with the internet. Now I know that.”
~
“Nothing, Dad,” she said, rolling her eyes. “Do you need to know every little detail about my life? Geez.”
“See? That right there? Totally worth the custody battle.”
~
“This girl… Gwendy—”
“I hate her already. Go on.”
~
“I wear the cheese. It does not wear me.”
“Honestly, you meet the most appalling sorts of people in these places.”
~ “Our bedroom, our rules,” Lois told her with a shrug. “Besides you’re old enough to know how you got here.”
“Mom, until the day I die I wish to live in the firm belief I was delivered by a stork,” Sophie said, sounding completely sincere.
~
“We haven’t done anything wrong,” James blurted before Ginny could say anything.
“I know that,” Ginny looked annoyed with her hands resting impatiently on her hips. “I come here every month to see Teddy.”
~
“Did she tell you I kick puppies too?”
“I don’t care what she thinks. And I’m not a dog person.”
~
“I know a guy. He calls himself the Bed Bug Exorcist.”
“We don’t want to convert them to Christianity. We need to get rid of them.”
~
“I was going to use my key but I thought you might have changed the locks.”
“I wouldn’t do that…on a weekend. They charge extra.”
~
“No, I’m glad you saved my life. I have a haircut next week and I need to see how it turns out.”
~
I have it on excellent authority (my member of the league of holy matrimony had it from your member of the league) that the lad claims to have seen things in my big paperweight. A truly reliable gazing ball would come in very useful, so if he has found a way to create one, I owe Arthur a debt of gratitude. I can promise yout aht if I had a truly reliable gazing ball, I would never again return to my home weary from the hardships of the road to find my sister-at-law still visiting. Certainly not when the visitor seems to labour under the impression that she is hiding from a mysterious organisation that plots her demise. (Not that I don’t occasionally sympathise with the urge to plot her demise.)
~
“I could have caught him, Mama!” Arthur said. 
“And what would you have done with him them?” I said. “Even if it is the same man, he is much larger than you are. From the black eye you are currently sporting, courtesy of little Ella, it seems clear that you require some practice with fisticuffs before you can successfully deal with an opponent of your own size and weight. It therefore seems highly unlikely that you would have succeeded in apprehending the villain. More likely, if it was the same man, he would have captured you, which would have greatly distressed your sisters and your father.”
“Not you?” Arthur asked.
“I should have thought that being kidnapped and fed only bread and butter in an underground dungeon was just what you deserved for so serious a lapse in judgment,” I said. 
~
James’ knowledge of German is limited to what he refers to as “soldier’s phrases,” which I take to mean a combination of military commands and vulgar language. 
~
“I have every confidence in your skill at interrogation and in Daniel’s complacency. The man’s sublime interest in himself is only matched by his serene assumption that ht rest of the world shares it. With luck, Daniel will never even notice he’s being questioned.”
~
Quentin was thin and tall, though he habitually hunched his shoulders in a vain attempt to brace himself against whatever blow was coming from the heavens, and which would logically hit the tall people first. 
~
He spoke very correctly, as if he wished he had an English accent but wasn’t quite pretentious enough to affect one.
~
But there were more exotic questions, too. One of them showed him the back of a playing car—not an actual card but a drawing of the back of a playing card, mind you, featuring your standard twin angels riding bicycles—and asked him to guess what card it was. Or later on the test gave him a passage from The Tempest, then asked him to make up a fake language, and then translate the Shakespeare into the made-up language. He was then asked questions about the grammar and orthography of his made up language, and then questions about the made-up geography and culture and society of the made-up country where his made-up language was so fluently spoken. Then he had to translate the original passage from the fake language back into English, paying particular attention to any resulting distortions in grammar, word choice, and meaning. 
~
Magic, Quentin discovered, wasn’t romantic at all. It was grim and repetitive and deceptive. And he worked his ass off and became very good at it. 
~
“And if you find Lady Popper’s rather quaint eighteenth-century English difficult, keep in mind that next month we will be starting Middle English, Latin, and old High Dutch, at which time you will look back on Lady Popper’s eighteenth-century English with fond nostalgia.”
~
“Go like this,” she said, holding up her hands as if she were about to conduct an invisible orchestra. He went like this.
~ He closed his eyes. When he opened them again Professor March was addressing him directly.
“…between a subtropical cyclone and an extratropical? Quentin? In the French, please, if you can.”
Quentin blinked. He must have drifted off. “The difference?” he hazarded. “There is no difference?” There was a long, awkward pause, into which Quentin inserted more words in an attempt to find out what exactly the question had been, and to say “baroclinic zones” as many times as possible just in case they were relevant.
~
“We have to have a welters team,” Janet announced one day.
“No,” Eliot said, “we don’t.” He lay with one arm over his face on an old leather couch. They were in the library, exhausted from having nothing all day. 
“Yes, actually we do, Eliot.” She nudged him sharply in the ribs with her foot. “Bigby told me. There’s a tournament. Everybody has to play. They just haven’t announced it yet.”
“Shit,” Eliot, Alice, Josh, and Quentin all said in unison.
“I call equipment manager,” Alice added. 
“I vote Janet captain,” Eliot said.
“Of course I’m captain. And as captain it is my happy duty to inform you that your first practice is in fifteen minutes.”
~
“I bet they make us to go normal college. Just some random state school where we have to read Cannery Row and debate the Stamp Act. And like the second day Eliot’s going to be crying in the bathroom and begging for his foie gras and his malbec while some jock sodomizes him with a lacrosse stick.”
“Um, did that just turn into your total gay fantasy halfway through?”
~
He just couldn’t contain himself. He had to talk about it. “Honk!” he yelled. “Honk honk honk honk!” His classmates agreed. 
~
“I’ve taken the liberty of depriving you of the power of speech,” he said.
~
“Wait a minute,” Quentin said. “Who or what is the Thames dragon?”
“The Thames dragon,” Eliot said. “You know. The dragon who lives in the Thames. I’m sure he has another name, a dragon name, but I doubt we could pronounce it.”
“What are you saying.” Quentin looked around for help. “An actual dragon? Are you saying there are real dragons?!”
“Come on, Quentin,” Janet scoffed
~
Every morning when he woke up it seemed impossible that he could ever consume another drop of alcohol, but that conviction had always evaporated by five o’clock in the afternoon.
~
Instead Quentin went home with Alice. It was her idea, though as it got closer to the holidays Quentin wasn’t exactly sure why she’d invited him, since the prospect obviously made her suicidally uncomfortable.
“I don’t know, I don’t know!” she said when he asked her. “It just seemed like the kind of things boyfriends and girlfriends do!”
“Well, whatever, I don’t have to come. I’ll just stay here. Just say I had a paper to finish or something. I’ll see you in January.”
“But don’t you want to come?” she wailed.
“Of course I do. I want to see where you come from.”
“All right.” She didn’t sound any less anxious. “Do you promise to hate my parents as much as I do?”
“Oh, absolutely,” Quentin said. “Maybe even more.”
~
Alice’s father shook his outstretched hand. He seemed to forget he was doing it halfway through, then looked surprised to find a fleshy alien extremity still in his grip.
~
“So I’m a little worried about your parents,” Quentin said that afternoon. “I think they might be completely insane.”
~
Money people thought he was artsy, artsy people thought he was money, and everybody thought he was clever and good-looking.
~
In conversation he liked to address Quentin directly as “Quentin” a lot, which made him feel kind of like they were having a job interview. 
~
“How was Buffalo?”
“Like a vision of the apocalypse. We bought parka and hunting knives.”
~
Josh practiced a spell that uncurled Anna’s hair from a distance. She kept looking around, annoyed but unable to pinpoint the source. 
~
“Oh yeah,” Janet said. She made quotey-fingers. “Stat.”
~
“The thick plottens,” Eliot said dryly.
~
The bear, it emerged, drank only peach schnapps, which it sipped from delicate thimble-sized glasses. Given its bulk, Quentin guessed it could consume a more or less unlimited amount of it. The bear was named Humbledrum, and it was, as its name suggested, a very modest bear. It was a brown bear, it explained in deep sub-woofer tones, a species larger than the black bear but much smaller than the mighty grizzly bear, though the grizzly bear was in fact a variety of brown bear. It was not, Humbledrum reiterated periodically, half the bear that some of those grizzlies were. 
“But it’s not just about who’s the bigger bear,” Quentin offered. They were bonding.
~
“I’m alive. I can tell because of all the pain.”
~
He was dressed all in black and wore a long cape, apparently as an expression of the extreme seriousness with which he regarded himself and his abilities. Her clothes were loose-fitting and practical, evidently designed for ease of movement in unpredictable situations. She was, to the best of Quentin’s ability to judge these things, a lesbian.
~
What ‘inc aga’ looked like in practice was highly impossible for Quentin to fathom—Faye would talk about it only in high-flow, abstract metaphors. She and Dint were both adventurers by profession.
~ Then centaurs watched him weep with alien unconcern, like fish.
~
“I don’t make the rules,” the Questing Beast said. “You don’t like it, find some other magic stage and shoot it instead.”
~ “I’m not stealing street signs. I’m liberating the residents from the artificial social framework enforced by their addresses!” she exclaimed, finally wrenching the plate loose.
~
“It isn’t the same thing, actually. Hares are bigger. And they don’t live in burrows, they make nests in open ground.”
“Don’t start,” both Julia and Janet said in unison.
“Here’s my real question,” Quentin said. “If this rabbit thing really can see the future, won’t it know we’re trying to catch it?”
~ She didn’t speak much these days. And for some reason she’d mostly given up using contractions. She didn’t ride a horse at all but an enormous furry quadruped that she called a civet, which looked like an ordinary civet, long and brown and vaguely feline, with a fluidly curving back, except that it was the size of a horse. Quentin suspected it could talk—its eyes gleamed with a bit more sentience than they should have, and it always seemed to follow their conversations with too much interest. 
~ “Wake me up,” he said, “if anything happens?” He’d meant to make it a demand, a condition of his compliance, but it came out a lot less authoritative than he’d intended. More plea than assertion.
~
Superman gave her a look that was probably menacing in Metropolis but as threatening as a friendly handshake in Gotham.
~
“Great! Let’s go!” For a second, the Flash blurred and vanished. An instant later he was back, looking sheepish. “Oh, right. Or we could walk. Walking is good.”
~
Billy knows the minute he walks in, he’s getting far too good at recognising Hammer with the back of his head. He thinks maybe that’s a survival instinct. “I’m doing laundry, and you’re not allowed to harass me when I’m not in costume,” Billy reminds him. It’s one of the rules. Hammer appears at his left, in full costume, Billy’s never seen him out of costume maybe he doesn’t even have a real identity? Maybe his parents grew him in a tube. “Evil laundry!” Hammer accuses, and Billy really is starting to wonder if Hammer is actually a crazy person. “No, just laundry, strangely enough.” Hammer looks tempted, just for a moment, to rifle through it. Billy decides that if he tries it they’re going to have a problem.
~
“You’re just a little bit gay aren’t you,” Billy says quietly. There’s a very long moment of pointed silence from Captain Hammer. 
“Of course not, I’m a superhero,” he says, not entirely convincingly. As protests go, it’s an interesting one. “Of course you are,” Billy says sensibly. “And the two are obviously mutually exclusive.” Hammer scowls at him like he doesn’t know what that means, but suspects he’s being insulted.
~
Oliver smirked. “What makes you think I’m up to something?”
“You’re breathing aren’t you?”
~
“Nuh-uh,” the kid lies with no visible shame, and she immediately decides she likes him.
~
“It’s not cheating. Battleships change position during a war. It’s what they were designed to do.”
~
“I’m telling you. Hot girls and those cars are always together. It’s like a law. Like water. Or dinosaurs.”
“Neither of those are laws, Taco.”
~
“What seems to be the problem with your car, sir? Why did you call for the tow truck.”
“Operator error.”
“You mean you’re too drunk to drive. Why not just call a cab or have a friend drive you?”
“Because I have the Premium Plus plan and 200 miles of free towing?”
~
“What are you going to do? Just run up and knock on the door?”
“Don’t mock. It took me hours to come along with that plan.”
~
“Man, these are some dark times. I’m going to break out the emergency tequila. Where is it again?”
“Right next to the regular tequila.”
~
“If he’s Green Lantern, then I’m, like, Hawkman.”
“Who’s Hawkman again?”
“Exactly.”
~
“You are going to go out tonight. And you know why? Because guess who’s on your case: the Mayor of Fun,” he announced, doing an embarrassing little dance.
“Ok, I don’t want the Mayor on my case. Mayors don’t take cases. This metaphor has always bothered me.”
~
“Remember the backstage passes to Kanye? That was not backstage. That was outside the backstage door. Different!”
“Hey, those passes seemed legit.”
“To be fair, Kanye was spelled CONYAY.”
~
“Ok, gentlemen, step number two: get very drunk.”
“I don’t want to be nitpicky, but that was also step number one.”
“It’s also the next five steps. What’s your point?”
~
“I think I’m done throwing up now.”
“But just in case, let’s stay toilet-adjacent.”
~ He liked one tapestry in particular that depicted a marvellously appointed griffin frozen in the act of putting a company of foot soldiers to flight. It was supposed to symbolise the triumph of some group of long-dead people over some other group of long-dead people whom nobody had liked, but for some reason the griffin had cocked its head to one side in the midst of its rampage and was gazing directly out of its woven universe at the viewer as if to say, yes, granted. I’m good at this. But is this really the best use of my time?
~
In all honesty Quentin had only a very vague idea of how tournaments worked, or even what they were, except that they were something kings used to do at some point between when Jesus was alive and when Shakespeare was alive, which was as close as Quentin could get to placing when the Middle Ages had actually happened. He put the word out: a week from now anyone who thought he could handle a blade should turn up at the castle and start whacking till there was no one left to whack. Winner gets a small but very choice castle in the Fillorian boondocks and the honour of guarding the king’s royal person on his upcoming journey to an undisclosed location. 
~
He walked in while they were clearing the grand banquet hall. “Pardon me, Your Highness,” Eliot said, “but what the hell are you doing?”
“Sorry. It’s the only room that was big enough for the matches.”
“This is the part where I’m supposed to say, ‘Matches, what matches?’”
“For the tournament. Sword fighting. You didn’t see the posters? I’m having a tournament to find the best swordsman in Fillory.”
“Well can’t you have it outside?”
“What if it rains?”
“What if I want to eat something?”
~
The run, which has seemed so delightful the night before, so absolutely good and necessary, had now revealed its true nature as a hideous toxin, a drier of mouths and ravager of brains. He cursed the earlier incarnation of himself that drank so much of it.
~
“Oh, you’ve got an extra crew member. I forgot to tell you. The talking animals sent someone.”
“What? Who?”
“Exactly. Who or what, I never know which. It’s already on board. Sorry, it was politically expedient.”
“You could have asked me.”
“I would have, but I thought you might say no.”
“I miss you already. See you in a week.”
~ The dragon was a lot scoldier than he expected. And disappointingly cryptic. Somehow in the back of his mind he’d vaguely thought that the dragon might want to be his friend, and they would fly around the world solving mysteries together. The chances of that happening now looked vanishingly small. 
~
Josh brought them out in a public park not far from the centre of Penzance. This kind of precision over that much distance hadn’t been possible even a few years ago, but Google Street View was an absolute book to the art and craft of creating long-distance portals.
~
They played High C’s, a primally simple alphabet game in which the main goal seemed to be to win the pregame argument with your fellow players over who got to be the dolphin. After that everything else was blind chance and cartoon fish.
~
He was a professional killer, efficient and businesslike. He was like a baker, except instead of making bread he made corpses, and he wanted to make Quentin into one. 
~
“The cook caught a talking fish. It told us what to do. It had a bottle in its belly with a map inside. What happened to you?”
~
“Oh no, you think she’s going to make Indian food?”
“Evan! If she was Italian would you assume that she’d cook Italian food?”
“Yes. And that’d be great because I love Italian food.”
~
“I’ve never seen a dryad fight.”
“That’s because nobody is stupid enough to fight one.”
~
“Death and destruction,” the hare called out as it ran, in case it hadn’t made itself clear before. “Disappointment and despair.”
~
“I have a hard time believing that the history of the universe is being written by a talking rabbit, though that would explain a lot.”
~
“Did you know he was a were-lion? He was hairy everywhere!”
“Please,” Eliot said. “I would give anything to not know how you know that.”
~
“What do you want to do? We’re the kings of a magical utopia.”
“Some progressive reforms? I want to help somebody with something. If I was a Fillorian, I would depose me as an aristocratic parasite.”
~
“The Outer Island.” He picked up some royal looking document. “That’s what it says. I’m king of it and I don’t even know where it is.”
~
“You know, we’re not invading it. We don’t need to send a king. They haven’t paid their taxes, which, by the way is like eight fish. They’re not exactly powering the whole economy.”
~
“I’ve worked here for three years. You only flirt with me when you need something. What is it?”
~
“I’m a king. It’s not like they’re not going to re-elect me.”
~
The man’s name, absurdly enough, was Bingle. He wasn’t anywhere near as jolly as his name made him sound, thought that would have been almost impossible since his name made him sound like a clown who entertained at children’s parties. 
~
Quentin had a feeling that not a lot of people came to the map room, and still less often were those people royalty. At any rate, Benedict was out of practice at showing the appropriate amount of deference. Quentin sympathised. 
~
In one match, Bingle’s opponent waited till the opening bell had rung and then calmly stepped over the chalk line out of bounds for an automatic forfeit. Apparently they’d met before, and once had been enough.

“You know I’d kiss you right now but your family scares the crap out of me,” he said, peering anxiously at the faces in the window.

Julia had already stowed herself in her cabin with the air of someone who wasn’t planning to re-emerge till they’d made landfall. 
~
One of the topiary animals, an elephant calf, had broken free of its hedge and was running amok around the grounds, albeit very slowly, at the rate of about a yard a day. 
~
Venice was the only city he’d ever seen that looked the same in real life as it did in pictures. It was consoling that something in this world met expectations. 
~
“Penzance?” Josh asked. “Like as in the pirates of? Since when is that a real place?”
~
“I’ll spare you the details—” which is what Eliot said when he was going to march you through everything blow-by-blow. 
~ Florence had talked in an airy sort of way about destroying the manuscript; but when one came down to it, how the deuce can a chap destroy a great chunky mass of paper in somebody else’s house in the middle of the summer? I couldn’t ask to have a fire in y bedroom, with the thermometer in the eighties. And if I didn’t burn the thing, how else could I get rid of it? Fellows on the battlefield eat dispatches to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy, but it would have taken me a year to eat that manuscript. 
~
“But lots of fellows have asked me who my tailor is.”
“Doubtless in order to avoid him, sir.”
“He’s supposed to be one the best men in London.”
“I am saying nothing against his moral character, sir.”
~
“It’s a topping morning, Jeeves.”
“Decidedly, sir.”
“Spring and all that. In the spring, Jeeves, a livelier iris gleams upon the burnished dove.”
“So I have been informed, sir.”
“Right-o! Then bring me my whangee, my yellowest shoes, and the old green Homburg. I’m going to the park to do pastoral dances.”
~
“Bertie,” said Bingo, reproachfully, “I saved your life once.”
“When?”
“Didn’t I? It must have been some other fellow then.”
~ Bingo was both surprised and delighted to see me, and introduced me to the kid. If the latter was surprised and delighted, too, he concealed it like a diplomat. He was one of those supercilious striplings, who give you the impression that you went to the wrong school and that your clothes don’t fit. 
~
“Go outside and play. When I was your age, I was friends with whoever happened to be out roaming the neighbourhood.”
“Sounds like a good way to get stabbed by a hobo,” Nate grumbled.
~
“I don’t know,” Summer said. “We’re pretty selective.”
“Let me guess,” Nate said. “Nobody ever tried to join.”
“Something like that,” Summer admitted.
~
“They have some club, but they’re not sure if I can join. I think they’re trying to make up an initiation.”
“Don’t eat anything unsanitary.”
~
“With a name like Presidential Estates, shouldn’t they be bigger houses? We should at least have a pool. Or some pillars. They should rename the place Typical Neighbourhood Estates.”
~
“Can’t you home-school me?” Nate pleaded.
“You would never do any work.”
“Sounds perfect!”
~
“My name is Miss Doulin,” she said. She underlined the word Miss. “Not Mrs. Doulin. Mrs. Doulin is my mother.” Miss Doulin had to be in her late thirties. She was not a pretty woman. Her hair was shaggy, her lips were thin, and her eyes were too close together. Summer doubted whether Miss Doulin would ever have a Mrs. in front of her name. 
~
“I can practically taste our victory now. And it tastes like cheesecake miraculously devoid of calories.”
~ There was no doubt that, at times, my Uncle Henry did rummy things, notably keeping eleven pet rabbits in his bedroom; and I suppose a purist might have considered him more or less off his onion. 
~
A fellow living in a London flat is so handicapped. I mean to say, if I had been the young squire greeting the visitor in the country, I could have said “Welcome to Meadowsweet Hall!” or something zippy like that. It sounds silly to say: “Welcome to Number 6a, Crichton Mansions, Berkeley Street, W1”.
~
“So the Duke is off his rocker, what?”
“The expression which you use is not precisely the one I should have employed myself with reference to the head of perhaps the noblest family in England, but there is no doubt that cerebral excitement does, as you suggest, exist in no small degree.”
~
“So I was reading through my journal last night—”
“Your diary?”
“No, journal. And I realised that the year’s almost over and I’ve only dated one girl.”
“And you see no obvious connection between this fact and the diary?”
“Journal.”
~ As a rule, from what I’ve observed, the American captain of industry doesn’t do anything out of business hours. When he has put the cat out and locked up the office for the night, he just relapses into a state of coma from which he emerges only to start being a captain of industry again. But Mr. Worple in his spare time was what is known as an ornithologist. He had written a book called American Birds, and was writing another, to be called More American Birds. When he had finished that, the presumption was that he would begin a third, and keep on till the supply of American birds gave out. Corky used to go to him about once every three months and let him talk about American birds, but it was pretty rotten for the poor chap. You see, birds, except when broiled and in the society of a cold bottle, bored him stiff. 
~
“Sir?” said Jeeves, kind of manifesting himself. One of the rummy things about Jeeves is that, unless you watch like a hawk, you very seldom see him come into a room. He’s like one of those weird birds in India who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they want them. I’ve got a cousin who’s what they call a Theosophist, and he says he’s often nearly worked the thing himself, but can’t quite bring it off, probably owing to having fed in his boyhood on the flesh of animals slain in anger and pie.  
~
“Your presence has been requested immediately.”
She sighed. “Now?”
“Well, however you want to take the words ‘requested’ and ‘immediately’,” he replied. 
~
“I think we need to hack into Harvard’s system and fix my records.”
“Can’t. I’m busy breaking into Fort Knox to steal some dubloons.”
“Dubloons?”
“Your premise was so silly that it warranted the use of a silly word.”
~
“He was gushing about me?”
“Well, he mentioned that you exist. Which is gushing for Harvey.”
~
Jeeves smiled paternally. Or, rather, he had a kind of paternal muscular spasm about the mouth, which is the nearest he ever gets to smiling. 
~
“Oh, like Gollum from Lord of the Rings?”
“I don’t know what that is because I’m pretty.”
~
“We won’t let you say or do anything bad. We’ll be like Tom Cruise’s first publicist. Man, that guy was great.”
~
“Mrs. Newman is my slave name. You can call me Cathy.”
~
“Did you tell that guy at the basketball court that you were an attorney for the Department of Justice?”
“Not explicitly…I mean, people hear what they want to hear…I won’t impersonate a federal officer again?”
~ “You know, the longer I live in New York, the more I clearly see that half the trouble in this bally world is caused by the light-hearted and thoughtless way in which chappies dash off letters of introduction and hand them to other chappies to deliver to chappies of the third part. It’s one of those things that makes you wish you were living in the Stone Age. What I mean to say is, if a fellow in those days wanted to give anyone a letter of introduction, he had to spend a month or so carving it on a large-sized boulder, and the chances were that the other bird got so sick of lugging thing round in the hot sun that he dropped it after the first mile.” 
~
“I am familiar with the name Bassington-Bassington, sir. There are three branches of the Bassington-Bassingtons family—the Shropshire Basington-Bassingtons, the Hampshire Bassington-Bassingtons, and the Kent Bassington-Bassingtons.”
“England seems pretty well stocked up with the Bassington-Bassingtons.”
“Tolerably so, sir.”
“No chance of a sudden shortage, I mean, what?”
“Presumably not, sir.”
“And what sort of a specimen is this one?”
“I could not say, sir, on such short acquaintance.”
“Will you give me a sporting two to one, Jeeves, judging from what you have seen of him, that this chappie is not a blighter or an excrescence?”
“No, sir. I should not care to venture such odds.”
~
“Old George is an American,” I explained.
“Of course, I didn’t invent the country,” said George. “That was Columbus. But I shall be delighted to consider any improvements you may suggest, and lay them before the proper authorities.”
~
“Why don’t the policemen in New York dress properly? Why don’t they wear helmets like they do in London? Why do they look like postmen? It isn’t fair on a fellow. Makes it dashed confusing. I was simply standing on the pavement looking at things, when a fellow who looked like a postman prodded me in the ribs with a club. I didn’t see why I should have postmen prodding me. Why the dickens should a fellow come three thousand miles to be prodded by postmen? I gave him a shove. And then he biffed me in the eye and lugged me off to this beastly place.”
~
“Piece of unsolicited advice?”
“Do you give any other kind?”
~ “Earthly sources would not yet be aware,” Spencer told him solemnly. “This knowledge is solely the province of the nether regions....” He stopped, grimacing, and turned to Guster. “Nether regions? That kind of sounds like I pulled the information out of my ass. Is there a better way to say that?” Guster looked up from his plate with what appeared to be great difficulty. “I thought that’s where you got all your information, Shawn.”
“You have guacamole on your nose,” Shawn told him darkly.
~
“Okay,” said Peter, easing back into his chair in time for the waitress to arrive with coffee and croissants. “Congratulations Spencer. Guster. You now have a security detail.” Both men gazed around them, and looked disappointed when large men in suits and dark glasses failed to materialise.
~ “I knew you wouldn’t be able to resist conning yet another agency, Spencer, but I’ve got news for you: this is the FBI and they aren’t going to fall for your psychic shenanigans.” “That was a beautiful sentence, Lassy.” Shawn’s voice was almost entirely sincere. “Very Scooby Doo... ish?” He turned to Guster for confirmation. Gus gave it some thought. “Scoobyesque?” he suggested.
~
“I like your hat,” Juliet told Neal as they filed into the elevator. “I have hats,” Shawn announced to nobody in particular. “Many, many hats. I’d wear them, only it’d be a crime to cover up this hair.” He paused, a little awkwardly. “Gus too. Gus has a thousand awesome hats but the ladies would cry if he hid that sweet chocolate noggin away from the world.” “You know that’s right,” Gus agreed.
~ Shawn cleared his throat. “So, uh. Are we talking Queer as Folk kind of gay club? Because Gus has a quota.”
“I can’t look at any more naked men until 2017,” Gus told them sternly. “I don’t care if everyone in there is fifty years old and dressed from neck to ankle. I’m just not taking that chance.” Shawn gave him a disappointed look. “Gus, I thought we’d cured you of that pesky homophobia.” Gus widened his eyes in outrage. “I don’t fear men who like naked men, Shawn. Just the naked men themselves. And I will not be sneered at by a man who’s scared of tassels on loafers.”
~
Gus whistled. “Damn, girl.” Shawn stared at him for a second. “It creeps me out when you say black people things, Gus.” He shifted his attention back to Juliet, then, and shook his head. “Damn, girl.”
~
“All right. We’ll spy on Cassie—”
“‘Spy’ is such a negative word, can’t we use something like ‘watch over’?—”
“But when it inevitably backfires,” Tim continues loudly, “I reserve the right to a hundred I-told-you-so’s.”
~
“What, more homicidal than I used to be?”
“I was going to say ‘emo’, but sure, let’s go with homicidal if it makes you feel less like a girl.”
~
“How in the world would you even be able to tell if a model car was evil?” Lex demanded.
Clark shrugged. “I’m sure I wouldn’t know, not being evil myself or an expert on model cars.”
“And what makes you think that I’m such an expert?” Lex rolled his eyes. “Tragically, I don’t have the faintest idea how you’d go about figuring something like that out but for the record I don’t actually believe that it’s possible to have an evil model car.”
“You know, it’s always the evil ones who start going on about how there is no good or evil,” Clark said conversationally. “Have you ever noticed that?”
~
It’s been awhile since Eliot saw his little brother. Staring down the barrel of Arthur’s gun was not exactly how he’d hoped a reunion might happen, but he has to admit the odds had been better than even. “What’s up with your hair?” he asks curiously.
~
“You don’t look anything alike. Are you sure you’re brothers?” Parker demands, peering at him from where she’s perched cross-legged on the dresser. Eliot scowls at her, seeing Arthur do the same from across the room. Her eyebrows pop up in surprise and she nods. “Okay, now I can see it.”
~ Ruby stopped trying to burrow into the seat, instead running her hands through her hair and letting it fall, artfully, over one shoulder. She licked her lips, and did something hard to define with her clothing that resulted in Sam suddenly finding himself face to face with more cleavage than he was used to seeing in a public place.
~
Beaten and bloody, she struggles to choke out, “All men will hate you because of me. But not a hair of your head will perish. By standing firm you will gain life.” Luke 21:17. She swings out to connect with his jaw, and Briathos stumbles back with the blow. “Also,” she adds as an afterthought, advancing. “Fuck you.”
~
As if she could read his thoughts, she laughed. “Don’t let this thing fool you, Sam. I can take you. My Tai Chi teacher says that I have untapped potential in the martial arts.” She looked down at the Retriever, panting happily with his tongue lulled to one side. “And Marshall here, believe it or not, is a trained attack dog. He can be quite ferocious.”
To make her speech seem even more absurd than it already did, Marshall chose that moment to extend his paw in greeting to Sam. “Don’t fall for it. It’s a trick. That’s his warning move.”
~
“The attackers—are they with you or after you?”
“I despair that you automatically assume I’m involved.”
~
“We’re in lock down, radio’s compromised. We’ve got teams on them, but Command believes the attackers are only after one thing: him.”
Him, of course, meant Alex. “I don’t appreciate being objectified,” he informed the room at large, to silence and general incredulity.
~ To his surprise, it was a handwritten letter of some kind. “To the Righteous Man”
“Aw, shit,” Dean grumbled, “I thought we were through with that.”
“I know you probably thought you were through with that.” Dean blinked slowly, then stared around suspiciously. “You would have been—done with it all, that is—if you had done it right. But, no, you just had to listen to the Abomination— “Dean sighed. Sam was going to love that—and a fallen angel who clearly landed on his head when he fell. “And it is written that when the Righteous Man sheds blood in Hell, as he breaks, so shall the First Seal. He who began it must also end it.”  Do you see anything about Abominations getting involved there? Of course not.”
“But Sam got Lucifer into the cage. And the Horsemen were stopped!” Dean protested to the empty air.
“Yes, the Abomination fell into the cage with Lucifer, which cut the Morningstar’s hold over the Four Who Ride.”
“Okay, that’s enough,” Dean snarled, doing a 360º. “How the hell are you doing that?”
“I am your Prophecy of God; I already know what you are going to say (unfortunately, the Abomination’s mind is closed to me, or this would have been so much easier; I could have made sure he had…accidents at times when he was thinking of doing things that would derail everything).” Dean frowned fiercely at the letter. “If you don’t stop, your face might freeze like that! By the Creator’s Ineffable Presence, they would only have been small accidents. He would have been perfectly fine after an operation or two. And, no, do not crumple this letter up!” Dean unclenched his hand, his expression a scientifically impossible combination of guilt and I-have-no-idea-what-you’re-talking-about innocence. He carefully smoothed the page out.
~
“This is a murder, Castle,” she replied. “Not a vampire. Not an alien. Not a time machine.”
“Maybe it’s all of those things!” Castle exclaimed. “A time travelling vampire-alien!”
She gave him a look. “You had the double-espresso, didn’t you?”
~
“A couple of rules, Castle,” she said, as they parked outside the building. “One: you do not ask this man if he is a habitual drinker of blood, female or otherwise. Two: you don’t say anything. Three: don’t break rule one or two.”
~
She looked at the bottle, then back at him. “Holy water?”
“Beckett might think it’s my imagination,” her father said, “But I think it’s better to be safe than sorry.” He reached into the box on the counter and pulled out an oversized crucifix. “Do you want this over your bed or on the door?”
Alexis carefully put the bottle down. “Dad,” she said calmly, “you remember you told me that one day, there would be a day when the writing got too much, and your brain melted out your ears, and you would start acting crazy?”
~ “You do not follow police protocol,” he observed, leaning lazily sideways. “You cannot shoot a man with no weapon, I think.”
Beckett stared coldly at him. “I would risk it,” she said bluntly. “How many women have you killed?”
He smiled, his teeth gleaming. “How many have you found?”
~
“Can you lose ‘em?”
“In New York traffic? Yeah, sure, let me just wave my magic wand.”
~ “You people work with a time traveller!” said Dean. “All we do is hunt supernatural creatures!”
~
‘What is it?’ John asked, which he thought was a perfectly reasonable question. Sherlock made an irritated noise that John was growing to associate with ‘being thwarted by arch-nemesis/brother, will take it out in kind, preferably around the holidays for maximum impact.’ Since there was no return address, and it was addressed to John, and it also probably did not contain a bomb, he opened it.
~
“Er. Hello,” Ianto said. “He’s got amnesia,” Jack said. “He got hit on the head on his way through the rift,” Jack said, steering Ianto towards the medical bay. “For him, it’s been three, four days. He’s showing no signs of slurring or delayed thought—he just can’t remember much beyond his own name. And he recognised me when he saw me—both of me—but didn’t know where from.” “Let’s have a look then,” Owen said. “I’m Dr. Owen Harper, Ianto. You think I’m fucking fantastic and nothing makes you happier than making me coffee.” Ianto’s eyes narrowed. “Just because I can’t remember you,” he said, “it doesn’t mean I can’t tell when you’re lying your bloody head off.”
~
“It wasn’t a demonic fern,” Dean mutters, but he pours some holy water out of his flask anyway. It might not help, but it won’t hurt either.
~
“Would you believe I’m working my way through college?” “And I read Playboy for the articles.”
~
Dean blinked. “You think I’m Carver Edlund?” “It’s clearly a nom de plume.” “I don’t know what that is, but it’s totally not one of those.”
~
“How well can you take a punch?” asked Deputy Ambassador Schmidt.
Harry blinked and set down his drink. “You know, there are a number of places a conversation can go after a question like that,” he said. “None of them end well.”
~
‘This is the worst plan we’ve ever had,’ complains the shorter one. He looks pretty tough-guy in his leather jacket, but Jack takes in his pink nose and slightly congested voice and decides otherwise. ‘Not the worst...’ ‘Yeah.’ Leather Jacket seems pretty sure. ‘The worst.’
~ “Where are you?” Even though he knows Jack can’t see it, Ianto rolls his eyes. “I think it’s customary to start with hello, Jack.” “You’re not at the Hub,” Jack says, ignoring Ianto’s point, “and you’re not at your place.” Scribbling on the pad in front of him, Ianto notes his progress so far. “And you know this because…” “Because I was at the Hub, and I’m now in your flat. I picked the lock,” Jack adds, making the confession sound like an afterthought.
~
“My name is Ginny Weasley and I’m from the future.”
Sirius stared blankly for a few seconds, still slumped against the wall. “Okay, sure, why not.”
~ “How are there so many?” he asks. He looks terrified.
Fred blinks. “When did you last check your email?”
Angel looks at his hands, then his desk. There is a long silence before he asks, “How long have I had an email address?”
~ Wally and Robin exchanged a look; it was a mixture of abject horror and that combination of pity, disbelief, and mild exasperation that Kaldur had come to know as the ‘non-humans don’t know anything’ look.
~ “I can say, ‘Gentle stranger, have you seen any rabbits in the immediate vicinity’ and ‘May your nether regions be cursed with oozing pores,’” Buffy said. “I don’t think either phrase would be very helpful.” “Okay, Plan B,” Jack decided, sending her a dirty glance. “Let’s see if they speak English.”
~
“What can I say? Rumours of my death have been…Actually, they were totally accurate,” Buffy said. “But obviously your information is a bit out of date. I’ve been back for a while.”
~
“Summers,” he said more firmly, in his “it says ‘Colonel’ on my uniform” voice. “Get up here.”
~
“That’s not a plan,” he answered after a few, silently thoughtful, seconds. “That’s a suicide pact. I can see how you’d confuse the two.”
~
Eliot shook his head. “No.”
Nate smiled like Eliot had said yes and said, “You haven’t even heard the whole plan yet.”
“And I’m fine with that.” 
~ Eliot shot her a glare. “She gets to have fun, but I’m going to be avoiding the attentions of my fifteen cellmates?”
She waved that off. “You’re not that pretty.”
Hardison looked at him appraisingly for an uncomfortable moment before turning to Nate. “You know, he is kind of pretty. And some of those guys have been in there a while, the hair might confuse them is all I’m saying.”
~ So the taser had been a little unexpected, and it had brought back some unpleasant mental snap shots of the Ukraine. And Burma. And that time in Belfast. It wasn’t like he was starting to get a thing about it but didn’t anyone use pepper spray anymore? It was effective, it was efficient, and nobody’s nervous system got dissolved.
~
Eliot ignored him and tried a friendly smile for the first man. “You Jerome Valdez?” From the way Valdez took a step back, Eliot guessed he’d not pitched warm confidence so much as psychopath. He tried a wider smile. Valdez took another step back. Eliot gave up with a scowl. “I’m here to watch your back, okay?”
~
“He fell.” That was broadly true – the gangbanger had fallen. Kind of a lot.
The guards looked at each other and then at Valdez, who had the presence of mind to nod rapidly. “He slipped, on the water.” He pointed to a completely ‘pool of water’-free area of floor.
The cholo raised his head with the unfocused look of a man seeing two of everything. “I fell. Water.”
~ “I mean for you. It’s dangerous for you. I could just get myself thrown in solitary. No one could get me there.”
A play by play of exactly how someone could kill him while he was in solitary probably wouldn’t be a comfort so Eliot just said, “That’s Plan B, okay?”
~ Sophie stopped with an injured expression. “I thought we were past that: I ran things perfectly well while Nate was away. Nobody died, no one was arrested and your hair’s fine, you can barely see the—you know.”
Eliot reflexively raised a hand to the side of his head
.~
“First, I told you it’s Skrull—you can speak, like, four languages—you can learn Geek. Second of all,” Hardison leaned forward and held Nate’s attention. “I saw that.”
~ “I do like her,” Dan admitted hastily. “But I often like things that aren’t good for me.”
~ “Knitting? Is that allowed?” asks Rand, uncertainly. “On the bridge, I mean?”
“You’re allowed to do your bead thing,” says Sulu, without looking up from his thread squiggle.
“The subha are part of my expression of my religious principles!” she protests.
“Well, maybe socks are my religion,” says Sulu, stubbornly. Rand looks outraged, and a little like someone who schedules bridge shifts, so Sulu intelligently adds, “Or, uh, maybe not.”
~
One time, while they’re all waiting tensely for the admiralty to respond to Kirk’s request for clarification of orders (“So, when you say ‘all necessary action’, does that mean I can start a war? ‘Cuz I will, but I kind of feel you might have something to say on the subject.”), Sulu suddenly says “Fuck! Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!”
Kirk jumps, and then as Sulu does not immediately push them into warp, or page Scotty for more engine power, or leap up and repel boarders, but rather brings his knitting up about six centimetres away from his eyes, Kirk feels his left eyebrow climb, exactly in time with Spock’s oh my god, this is seriously fucked up.
“Is there something you’d like to share with the class?” Kirk asks.
“I almost dropped a stitch!” says Sulu, as if this is a red alert notice. He pokes his yarn-blob some more. “Don’t worry, though,” he adds, “I caught it.” As if anyone is worried about anything other than the fact their helmsman is mentally unstable.
Obviously this cannot be allowed to continue. Jim’s the one whose mind is being eaten by a elderly Vulcan who may or may not technically exist, there is no way there is allowed to be anyone crazier than him on his bridge.
~ She never shows up at his door, even though he explicitly invited her to, the first time they met. (“If you’d like to stop by my quarters, later, I have a private collection of artwork you might be interested in.” No one ever wants to see his Kansas wildlife prints. He has no idea why.)
~ Spock does the eyebrow. “Brain-Eater!” Kirk yells at him. Spock manages to convey without any motion that if his eyebrow were not already deployed, he would be deploying it now.
~ Sulu sounds shy. “It’s for you,” he says, and slides a bundle across. It’s knitting, of course, but Jim’s natural horror at this is stupidly outweighed by his curiosity, and man’s primordial instinct to unwrap presents. Sulu’s folded it into a little packet, and tied it with a ribbon, so unless Jim undoes the bow, he won’t know what it is. He hates not knowing what it is.
~ “Cancel my Friday tee time and let Kord know I won’t be joining him.” “Certainly, Master Bruce. Have I the privilege of offering the gentleman a rational excuse?”
~ With a few minor adjustments – say, varnishing the floorboards, giving the walls a fresh lick of paint, buying some new furniture, and then moving to somewhere else entirely – I was sure it could become a home from home.
~
I dropped the book in surprise. Now, at that time neither of us were the greatest of physical specimens, as no 14-year-old is, but I had presumed that of us both, I would be the first to make a mark on the fairer sex. After all, I had the advantages of wit, charm, better dress sense, and not being a complete twerp.
~
“Ours is a forbidden love! Our passion for one another transcends the bounds of mere social class.”
“That’s all very well, but does she have nice tits?” I said, one eyebrow raised.
“Fantastic,” Percy said solemnly.
~
“WHAT UNGODLY HORROR IS THIS?” he roared. (Do forgive me the use of capital letters. I understand the form is generally frowned upon, but lower case is inadequate to fully convey the Archdeacon’s manner of delivery.) “WHICH ONE OF YOU MISERABLE LITTLE TROGLODYTES TOOK MY HAT? YOU’LL GET THE POKER FOR THIS!”

“Are you going to a costume party as a beatnik?” Leonard asks, almost as soon as Sheldon walks through the door.
Sheldon looks at Leonard like he’s lost his mind. “It’s Saturday morning. Who would schedule such a party on a Saturday morning?”
Leonard sighs. Sometimes it drives him batty the way he has to spell out everything to Sheldon. “What’s with the turtleneck?”
Sheldon looks down at himself, as if he’s only just noticed he’s wearing the turtleneck. “I’m into turtlenecks now,” he finally says.
~
“Well?” Arthur tapped his fingers on his desk impatiently.
“Well what?” Merlin asked with saccharine sweetness.
“Tell me your plan.”
“‘Tell me your plan,’ what?”
“Just tell me your damn plan or I will throw you in a dungeon with Gwaine and that will be the end of all of my problems!”
Merlin tilted his head, considering the merits of the option. “I still think my plan is better,” he decided.
~
“She’s an Egyptologist. I hear she’s spicy.”
“What does that mean?”
“I don’t know. Not all my information is helpful.”
~
“You can’t go in. You’d stick out like Sam’s chin. Besides, I’ve been wanting to take ride into the country strapped to the bottom of a truck for ages.”
~
“She’s older. But, like, good old. Good old like my car, not like yours.”
~
“What is your name, boy?” The voice comes from behind him and he whirls to see a man in dark funereal colours with a harsh face and hair the colour of the snow that is falling straight through his lean body, leaving little glimmers of fast-fading gold in its wake.
“Fuck you,” says the young tough, badly startled— which is not entirely accurate, because his name is Johnny.
“Harry is missing,” the stranger says in clipped tones, a British accent like something off of the BBC, a villain from Doctor Who. “Help me retrieve him and perhaps I won’t leave you to Wizard Morningway’s tender mercies.”
Johnny considers this proposition. “Fuck you,” he enunciates clearly, because his point obviously hasn’t gotten across yet.
~
“I’m a wizard,” the kid corrects him seriously. “Magicians do stage stuff and sleight of hand. My dad was a magician. I’m a wizard. My name’s Harry,” he finishes, and that last part Johnny actually knew.
~
“He’s Bob.” The kid explains: “He’s kind of my tutor. He’s really old and kind of grumpy but he knows a lot. He’s from Bainbridge and his name means that he’s probably even older than William the Conqueror.” A pause, then, proudly: “I looked it up.”
~
“Did you know that that’s an Arabic word, from Al-Jabr, which is a word they used for calculating equations in a really long essay about math?” Harry recites.
“Nope!” Johnny says, with perfect honesty.

Why would anyone get a regular baby bottle when there were baby bottles with emerald inlay? Howl felt cheated, so he announced, “You can’t stop me getting it a teddy bear it will sleep with every night.” It was going to dance and sing and have a flashing heart on its belly, Howl decided, and they would somehow charm it to bleat the child’s name and remind him or her of his or her parents’ eternal love. Howl had a very enjoyable daydream of their child growing attached to the teddy and refusing to be parted with it, even when he turned ten. (In this particular daydream their child was a boy with his nose and Sophie’s beautiful reddish-gold hair, but their child varied in every imagining. Howl was certainly excited by the idea of not knowing; it had the feeling of an extra-special Christmas gift, wrapped up inside Sophie, but she would probably disdain that comparison, or think it creepy.)

“Stupid giant two-faced son-of-a-bitch Indian—”
“Native American,” Sam corrected absently from across the grotto.
“—which is stupid, too. I mean, I was born in America—doesn’t that make me a Native American?”

“Under no circumstances is he to leave that room. He has no medical conditions, he’s had enough water and he’s already used the bathroom.”

“You know that you trying to impress her never works.”
“It works for you.”
“Well, I am impressive.”
~
“He called me a whore.”
“I call you a whore all the time. Just apologise and he’ll take you back.”
“I thought he’d want to help me. God, I’m so stupid.”
“Stupid whore.”
~
“I can’t think of someone else when I’m trying to sleep with her.”
“Of course you can. How do you think ugly people manage?”
~
“He said I’m a horrible mother. And that Clem will grow up hating me.”
“Well, yeah, if he’s normal. You are his mother, after all.”

“I can take it easy in a bed that doesn’t cost, like, a thousand bucks a day and where nobody keeps waking you up to make sure you’re resting okay—oh, wait. You’ll be there…”

The blond one turned and gaped at his friend. Jim knew his name. It started with M. It wasn’t Michael. Or maybe it was. Wow, Jim was too drunk for this game. Tulio— yeah, Jim remembered that one, because it became progressively more fun to say with every tequila shot he downed— leapt to his feet, clutching his hand of cards to his chest in an unnecessarily dramatic fashion. “You wound me, sir!” he declared.
~ “I will be perfectly happy to defend your honour just as soon as I amass reasonable evidence that such a thing exists,” said Spock, which, what, how did he even manage to be that insulting in such a pleasant tone? Jim stared at him, impressed. “Unfair, man,” he said finally.
~
“I require incontrovertible proof linking this individual with this company, and the company with this incident in Montevideo.”
Kelly skimmed fast. “And do these links actually exist?”
“They do.” He pulled out his pocket watch and glanced at it. “But if proof of them cannot be found by the deadline, it may be necessary for us to construct some. Do keep that in mind.”

She’d landed Celia that job in New York through a combination of blackmail and aggressive disregard for the trans-Atlantic time difference when it came to making phone calls.

“I’m not naming the bloody cactus.”
“Which is why I named him for you.”
~ Having gotten it irrevocably into her head that smart was sexy, Chelsea had then set about acquiring smartness with the same determination she would have shown had ‘smart’ been replaced with ‘beige python shoes’ or ‘red hair’.
~ “I need you to take someone out to dinner and discuss—I don’t know, the endowment of a scholarship at your College, some excuse involving pots of money. And I need you to get some specific information out of him. But he can’t know I’m involved.”
“Do you want me to shag him?”
“Chelsea! No!”
“No need to get huffy, I just thought I’d ask. Do you mind if I shag him?”
“You haven’t even seen him.”
“But—pots of money, you said?”
“Probable criminal, I didn’t say.”
“Ooh, danger. I like it. When?”
~
Geoffrey Thwaites’s secretary, a middle-aged marvel of organisation who as far as Kelly knew only possessed three cardigans (all blue) and a single facial expression (Placid Disdain), gave a sigh and pressed the intercom before Kelly could even state her business.
~ “I may need a riot. Just a small one.”
“Our specialty,” said the twins.

Polly’s boyfriend, Aston Martin Willis, had been afflicted with parents who had more fondness for James Bond films than common sense, but he seemed to have emerged from the public school system miraculously unscathed. He had a ready smile, was as tall as Polly’s shoulder, and usually worked for about ten companies at once. Kelly was 99% sure he was one of the best hackers in the world, and almost as sure that if he and Polly put any serious effort into it, their combined talents could bring the techno-literate world to its knees in a matter of hours.
“Are you planning to have children, or just an army of intelligent robots?” Kelly inquired.

“I think my favourite part is this one where he makes a spelling mistake—”
“In his apoplectic rage, I like to think.”
“—and you spend two paragraphs explaining why this proves he’s stupid.”
~
“Does he speak English?” 
“No, but he’s fluent in glower.”
~
“Do you need any help?” he asks.  The muffled cursing emanating from beneath the raised hood stops, and a man’s voice rises in clear exasperation.  “No,” he says.  “I’m doing this for fun.”  British accent, sarcasm knife-sharp and used like a weapon. “I could get back in the car and keep going,” Dean offers.
~
“Sam was telling me,” Adams says, “that you two are going to exorcise a house in San Francisco.”  His voice wavers between amusement and intrigue and in the rear-view mirror, one dark eyebrow is lifted in what might or might not be mockery.
~
Spock is back; his gaze impassive as he considers the damage. “I believe,” he states calmly, “that we are in grave danger.”
~ The professor crosses her arms and narrows her eyes. “Mr. Scott,” she says. “I have three degrees in related fields and I’ve been teaching this class for nearly fifteen years. Do you think you could take over this lecture for me?” “No, no ma’am, I’d be a terrible, terrible teacher, but—” “Do you believe you know more about the subject than I do?” Scotty hesitates. “Is that a trick question?”

“She said you poured lemonade on the Junior Dean.”
“I wish the deuce,” said Claude, annoyed, “that people would get these things right. It wasn’t the Junior Dean, it was the Senior Tutor. And it wasn’t lemonade, it was soda-water.”
~
“Why didn’t you ask the way?”
“I can’t speak a word of French. And I couldn’t call a taxi because I’d left all my money at the hotel. And I would have taken a cab and paid it when I got to the hotel, but I suddenly discovered, dash it all, that I’d forgotten its name.” And there in a nutshell you have Charles Edward Biffen. As vague and woolen-headed a blighter as ever bit a sandwich. “I’d give a shilling,” said Biffy wistfully, “to know the name of that hotel.”
“You can owe it to me. Hotel Avenida, Rue du Colisee.”
“Bertie! This is uncanny. How the deuce did you know?”
“That was the address you left with Jeeves this morning.”
~
“Last year,” said Biffy, “I buzzed over to Canada to do a bit of salmon fishing.” I ordered another drink. If this was going to be a fish story, I needed stimulants. 
~
“The world,” said Sippy, “is very grey. How can I shake off this awful depression?”
“What you want, old man,” I sad, “is a policeman’s helmet.”
“Do I, Bertie?”
“If I were you, I’d just step straight across the street and get that one over there.”
“But there’s a policeman inside it. You can see him distinctly.”
“What does that matter?” I said. I simply couldn’t follow his reasoning. Sippy stood for a moment in thought.
“I believe you’re absolutely right,” said Sippy, brightening up in the most remarkable manner.
~
It’s in Dorsetshire; and, while not what you would call a fiercely exciting spot, has many good points. You spend the day there bathing and sitting on the sands, and in the evening you stroll out on the shore with the mosquitoes. At nine p.m. you rub ointment on the wounds and go to bed. It was a simple, healthy life, and it seemed to suit poor Freddy absolutely.

“Looks like someone had a lot of fun last night.”
“If by ‘fun’, you mean ‘vodka’, then yes.”

“You’re kidding me. You have Michael Jordan’s phone number? If I press this button, I can talk to Michael Jordan?”

“I told you that in confidence…over six Cosmopolitans.”
“Harold, really? You drink Cosmopolitans? You really shouldn’t do that unless you’re with girls and you’re never with girls so that means you should just never drink them.”

“It’s Benjamin. I’m sure you don’t like it when people call you ‘Mike’.”
“I prefer it, actually.”

Gilbert Blythe asks Anne to dance once, and Anne does her best to refuse in a way that is inoffensive and does not involve a feminist tirade.

“Babysit?” Castiel asks. He understands the concept, has read some junior fiction related to the matter about a particular club that dealt with that very thing but he doesn’t understand how it can possibly be something Sam needs.
~ Castiel can’t guess at an age because all small humans look generically the same to him but if he had to hazard a guess he would say between four and six.
~ “I’m bored.” “Does telling me that every twelve seconds help?” Sam asks, finally sounding irked which is what Dean was aiming for.
~
“The look you usually get before you announce that something truly horrible has happened,” Dean says, adding, “Or is about to.” “I’ve got a look for that?” McKay asks.

“Just, I’ve finally got a date with her, and I’ll probably ruin it by... oh, I don’t know. By saying something stupid, or spilling ruddy biscuits everywhere, or falling down.”
“By being yourself, then?” Sirius offered.
“Yes,” James said, throwing up his hands. “Exactly!”
~
“Nice day,” I said.”
“Quite.”
“But they say the crops need rain.”
He had buried himself in his paper once more, and seemed peeved this time on being lugged to the surface. “What?”
“The crops.”
“The crops?”
“Crops.”
“What crops?”
“Oh, just crops.”
He laid down his paper. “You seem to be desirous of giving me some information about crops. What is it?”
“I hear they need rain.”
“Indeed?” That concluded the small talk. 
~
And I drank a modicum of tea, with a good deal of hauteur.

I don’t know why, but somehow I had got it into my head that the first thing thrown at Tuppy would be a potato. One gets these fancies. It was, however, as a matter of fact, a banana, and I saw in an instant that the choice had been made by wiser heads than mine. These blokes who have grown up from childhood in the knowledge of how to treat a dramatic entertainment that doesn’t please them are aware of by a sort of instinct just what to do for the best, and the moment I saw that banana splash on Tuppy’s shirt-front, I realized how infinitely more effective and artistic it was than any potato could have been. Not that the potato school of thought had not also its supporters. As the proceedings warmed up, I noticed several intelligent-looking fellows who threw nothing else.

“I cannot recall his exact words, sir, but he drew a comparison between your mentality and that of a cuckoo. To the bird’s advantage, sir.”

Everyone called the smith’s prentice “boy” even though he was a hand taller than anyone there. Small towns being what they are, he would most likely remain “boy” until his beard filled out or he bloodied someone’s nose over the matter.

The two men glared at each other for a long moment. Eventually, Jake looked away, muttering something that could, conceivably, have been an apology.
~
“Oh, come on now,” Jake said, disagreeing mostly out of habit. “It’s not like…” He made an inarticulate gesture. “It can’t just…”
~
“A note? You sneak out and leave me a note?” He hissed angrily. “What am I, some dockside whore?”
“I knew you would just argue with me. Besides, you weren’t supposed to find it until morning.”
“I wasn’t even a good not. ‘If you are reading this, I am probably dead.’ What sort of a note is that?”
~ My father used to say, “Call a jack a jack. Call a spade a spade. But always call a whore a lady. Their lives are hard enough, and it never hurts to be polite.”

“Halfpenny a head. That’s right. Anyone without a head gets in free. Thank you, sir. That’s right, halfpenny. Yes, sir, empty head still pays full price.”

He would sing from time to time. He had a bright, reckless tenor that was always wandering off, looking for notes in the wrong places.

“That’s a clever wife you’ve got there, Arl. How much will you sell her for?”
“I need her for my work, unfortunately. But if you’re interested in a short term rental, I’m sure we could arrange a reas—” There was a fleshy thump as my mother elbowed him, followed by a slightly pained chortle in my father’s baritone. 
~
“Now, take these drinks, sit at that table, and talk. When I come back, I don’t want to find either one of you dead or the building on fire.”

“How would you kill that bird?”
“I probably wouldn’t. It’s done nothing to me.”
“Hypothetically.”
“I’m saying that, hypothetically, I wouldn’t do it.”

When I came out of the wagon, he had her in a dramatic dip and was giving her a kiss. It seemed like a good kiss. I watched with a calculating eye, dimly aware that at some point in the future I might want to kiss a lady. If I did, I wanted to do a decent job of it. 
~
Dax set himself alight while attempting a spectacular bit of fire breathing and had to be doused. All he suffered was a bit of singed beard and a slightly bruised pride. He recovered quickly under Ben’s ministrations, a mug of mead, and a reminder that not everyone was cut out to have eyebrows. 
~
“Father doesn’t worry about which fork to use and who outranks who,” I groused. My mother frowned, her eyes narrowing. “Who outranks whom,” I said grudgingly.
“Your father knows more than he lets on. And what he doesn’t know, he breeze past due to his considerable charm. That’s how he gets by.” She took my chin and turned my face towards her. “Do you just want to get by? Or do you want to make me proud?”
~ I was begging in Merchant’s Circle and so far the day had profited me two kicks (one guard, one mercenary), three shoves (two wagoneers, one sailor), one new curse concerning an unlikely anatomical configuration (also from the sailor), and a spray of spittle from a rather unendearing elderly man of indeterminate occupation.
~ I also felt guilty about the three pens I’d stolen, but only for a second. And since there was no convenient way to give them back, I stole a bottle of ink before I left.

“You are good friends and good company, but none of you are female, nor, with the possible exception of Simon, are you lovely.”

“He’s not a bad sort,” I mused after he left. “For nobility. It’s like he knows he’s better than you,  but doesn’t look down on you for it because he knows it’s not your fault.”

“Process of elimination. None of the other masters teach that sort of thing, so it must be your bailiwick.”
“By your logic, I should also be in charge of Solinade dances, needlework and horse thieving.”

“You have to promise me,” a red-eyed Simon said seriously, “that you will never play that song again without warning me first. Ever.”
“Was it that bad?”
“No!” Simon almost cried. “It’s…I’ve never—” He struggled, wordless for a moment, then bowed his head and began to cry hopelessly into his hands.
Wilem put a protective arm around Simon, who leaned unabashedly against his shoulder. “Our Simon has a tender heart,” he said gently.

“We can’t do anything but snap at each other. Anything too extreme would get us expelled for Conduct Unbecoming. Why do you think I haven’t made his life a hell?”

Her mouth made a line. “He’s staked a claim on me then?”
“Well, not as much. But he is my friend and there are certain protocols involved...”
“A gentleman’s agreement?” she asked acidly.
“More like honour among thieves, if you will.”
She looked me in the eye. “Kvothe,” she said seriously. “Steal me.”

P. S. Please rest assured that I did not notice the disgraceful condition of your bed linens, and did not judge your character thereby

He read the telegram out loud: “‘When you come tomorrow, bring my football boots. Also, if humanly possible, Irish water-spaniel. Urgent. Regards, Tuppy.’ What the devil do you make of that, Jeeves?”
“As I interpret the document, sir, Mr. Glossop wishes you, when you come tomorrow, to bring his football boots. Also, if humanly possible, an Irish water-spaniel. He hints that the matter is urgent and sends his regards.”

“I don’t want to end up like my mother. She has seven parrots.”
“I thought she had seven therapists?”
“Yeah, she has fourteen things telling her she’s pretty.”
~
“Anyway, enough about that. You left me a message that I did not listen to. What was it about?”
~
“I’m sorry, we’re looking for a what?  A haunted flask. At a freakin’ Civil War re-enactment. A place where all flasks go to die. Where everyone and his supervising officer has a flask.”

“Bertie, if you have the resource and courage to carry this thing through, I will take it as evidence that you are not the vapid and shiftless person most people think you. If you fail, I shall know that your Aunt Agatha was right when she called you a spineless invertebrate.”

“What do you mean ‘it’s not a treasure map’? It’s got an X on it.”

“Ok, there is no way I’m going to a book club. A) They’re stupid, boring and I have zero chance of getting laid there. B) See A.”

“I want you to take him out and do what you need to keep him with the company. Oh, and if you buy drugs, get a receipt. The IRS is loosening up on deductions.”

“Surely, you’re not frightened of a tiny little dog, Jeeves?”
“If I may so bold as to contradict you, sir, the creature seems to me to be above average in muscular development. May I also draw your attention to the number and size of the teeth.”

“I’m going to kill him,” she muttered. John wasn’t surprised. Most people wanted to kill Sherlock. Didn’t mean they meant to. It was a bit like sky diving. Everybody talked about doing it, but most people didn’t have the nerve to try.
~
John held up both hands and kept as far away as possible. “I just live here,” he said, the same way other people insisted they were just passing though, officer, honestly.
~
“You ran away from home?” John demanded. He didn’t know whether to laugh or shake his head sadly.
“I did not!” Sherlock insisted, once more focusing exclusively on John with a determination that was only slightly marred by the rising flush coming back with a vengeance.
“Did too,” the woman muttered.
“I most certainly did not!”
“You unbelievably did to!”
John settled for sighing. “I’ll put the kettle on, then, shall I?” He had a feeling this could take a while.
~
“My brother… is missing,” Mycroft finally admits, smoothly and with a dismissive smile, all the while hissing it out like it was the hardest thing he had ever said. “And for a week now he has been completely eluding me.”
“Oh,” Harry murmurs, leaning back a little. Me with Mycroft means Me, my underlings, all the security and street cameras in Britain and just about half in rest of the world, all of the people I could’ve and have hired, plus the entirety of the Muggle internet and everything connected to it. So it is no small thing.
~ “Why aren’t you Chief Inspector Lestrade yet?” Sophie ran her fingers over the letters on his nameplate, “Someone I need to take care of?” “Please don’t Sophie any of my colleagues.” “‘Sophie’ them? I’m a verb!” “Oh, you’re a verb, all right.” “Do you know what I missed the most? Well—one of the things. It’s how when you say things in that low voice, they don’t even have to make sense—’oh, you’re a verb all right’—they’re just incredibly sexy. It’s a talent I don’t think you know you’ve got.” “Look, I don’t enjoy being suspicious—” “Then don’t.” “...I think I’ve earned it.” He leaned forward on his arms. “And not that you’d be honest about it if you were, but ... are you here running a game?” Sophie calmly folded her hands. Lestrade continued. “And I’m saying ‘here’ and meaning ‘in London,’ or ‘in my office,’ or ‘back in my life,’ just to cover things, and by ‘running a game,’ I mean ‘are you about to mine my resources, contacts, or good will to further your criminal ends?’ More succinctly, Sophie, how would you like to use me this time?”
~
“The man you’re looking for is called Archibald Crimple.”  “Did you track him down in a Dickens novel?” “I’ve emailed you the particulars. He goes by ‘Chi-Chi,’ inexplicably.” “Ugh, awful.” Lestrade jotted the name down on a notepad. “Name like ‘Archibald,’ you go with ‘Archie.’ That’s just good sense.” “Or ‘Baldy’,” Sherlock smiled, “if one’s follicular state allows.”
~
“So you ... are a con artist.” “Sometimes.”
“And other times?”
“Yeah, all right, I’m a con artist.”

“You have ten seconds to get out of here,” Eliot says. It’s his most menacing voice, but that’s never worked on Dean as well as it does on everybody else.
“Come on, man,” Dean says.
“Nine.”
“You always take everything so personally?” “Eight.”
“Okay, okay.” Dean puts his hands up, rolls his eyes dramatically, and backs toward the window. “Christ, I’m going.”
~
“We crossed paths when I was working a job down in Tijuana a few years back,” Eliot says reluctantly. “It’s a long story.” “Crossed paths here having the meaning of hooked up,” Hardison says.
“Do you want me to break your face? ’Cause I can do that.”
“He just talks to me like that because he loves me,” Hardison whispers loudly at Nate. Eliot used to get respect, damn it. Not anymore, and the worst part is that he can’t quite remember when or how he lost it. Or even why it’s so important.
~
Hughes rubbed his forehead in frustration. “People are going to die, Peter.” “It’s VICAP. People are always going to die,” Peter said ruthlessly. At Hughes’s disapproving look, he sighed. “I know. I know, but I don’t work in violent crimes for a reason. I like my sleep nightmare-free, and my underlings untraumatized.”

“I’ve decided I like America,” John announced, changing the subject. “So far nobody in America has shot at us, which is more than can be said for any other country I’ve been to recently.”

“His mind’s wandering,” John Watson announced from the doorway. “Focus, Sherlock. We have tea.”  “You have one tea, three coffees, two Philadelphia rolls, one spider roll, one spicy tuna roll, some sort of chef’s assorted nigiri special, dumplings, and delusions that I am going to consume anything other than the tea,” Sherlock said. “Food, Sherlock,” John sing-songed. “It’s necessary to live! Look, it’s fish! Brain food. Delicious Omega-3s.” “I don’t eat on cases.” “Food,” John insisted, while Neal settled in next to Peter and gave him an amused look.  “American food tastes wrong,” Sherlock complained, as John thumped the spicy tuna down in front of him.  “Says the culture that invented boiling everything,” Neal said, before Peter could make an equally cutting retort.  “I don’t argue the culinary arts with criminals.” “Then I win.”
~
“You two,” Peter told them, holding up a hand. “Be careful.” “I’m always careful,” Sherlock assured him.  “I try very hard,” Neal said, which was at least honest.
~
“I’m starting to think I should go to Paris for the wedding. I mean, the Magic 8-Ball says ‘Ask me later’ but I don’t have time for that.”
~
“Going to wish me luck, John?” he asked, anticipation beginning to creep over his face.  “Try not to die,” John replied, resignation in every inch of his face.  “This is much safer than usual,” Sherlock told him. “He doesn’t even like guns.”
~
“Asmodeus?” Sherlock asked politely. It was always best to be pleasant in dealing with such beings.
“Oh my, greedy thing,” the demon said with a smile, “you were ambitious. No, not Asmodeus, sorry.”
“Oh,” Sherlock frowned and looked to the book in his hand, obviously wondering what he’d got wrong.
“Don’t worry, you did it all right. He was busy, so he sent me.”
~
John drops his arm and sits up, yawning. “Fine, I’m awake now. Put a cup on for me, will you?” He grins at all of them, an expression that falters as complete silence reigns. He glances from one blank face to the next. “You did know...you didn’t.” He glares at Sherlock. “Why would you text them to come over and not tell them I’m alive, you bloody idiot?”
“I didn’t,” Sherlock snaps back, “because you said it wasn’t the sort of news one breaks in a text message.”
~
“Thoracic. He’s a thoracic surgeon. What is that, like, dinosaurs or something?”
~
“Come, let us commemorate this moment with the adding of liquor to ice.”
~
The man toppled into the guard’s reluctant embrace. “I’m going to be sick now,” he confided.

“Yeah, she’s got it all planned out. Step One: Dad breaks out of a maximum security facility. Step Two: Dad breaks into a maximum security facility. Piece of cake.”

“Seriously, it costs, like, a hundred dollars to change your name. Go do it. Therapy is much more expensive.”

“You’ve already feasted on leftover muffins, cookies, and that big of jam sandwich I smuggled up yesterday. If I feed you any more, you’ll be too fat to fly.” The dove opened his mouth and cooed again, clearly unconcerned by such eventualities. 
“Highness?” Talia, the serving girl, was staring at her and the dove, clearly sceptical of a princess who chatted with the birds.

“Snow was the most beautiful girl in her kingdom,” Beatrice said.
Snow gave a modest shrug. “It was a rather small kingdom.”

“South,” she said, coming out of the trance. “Charlotte fled south.”

“It’s a strange place, that house. My uncle Cowen says the mother’s ghost is trapped up there in the attic, doomed to stay a year for every day of misery she put that poor girl through. ‘Course, Cowen also believes the fairies will steal his teeth if he sleeps with his mouth open.”

“If the tree tries to eat you, you should probably back up.”

“He changed into his donkey form and tried to kick us over the edge of the cliff. Let’s just say he ass-kicking didn’t go quite the way he had hoped.” She grinned. 
“If I’d known how many times you were going to make that joke, I’d have pushed you after him.”

“You drew the short stick,” Danielle guessed.
“Nah. Grint did. Then he pummelled me and broke my stick so it was shortest.”

“This is your contact? A drunken, crippled old gnome?”
Andorllan frowned. “I’m not crippled.”
“Touch my leg like that again and you will be.”

“But…I don’t understand. You told me you were the most powerful summoner in history; that you could conjure the lice from a beggar on the far side of the world.”
“Right, and I told those lovely pixie girls I was only a century old. What’s your point?”

“You have an awful lot of bandages in there.”
“I travel with Talia a lot.”

“Nice to see you too, Nexxle. My friends need to get to Arkhaven,” he said, eyeing the horse she was wiping down.
“Well, then it’s a good thing they have feet.”

“Look, he’s called Stomper for a reason and it isn’t because he likes Santa’s reindeer.”
“You think Santa has a reindeer named Stomper?”
“You’re missing my point.”
“I refuse to listen to a man who doesn’t know the names of the reindeer.”

“Wyatt, do you remember six months ago when you got all nervous and thought everything was falling apart?”
“Yeah, yeah, but this is a little different.”
“That’s what you said then. And a year ago. And eighteen months ago. And we agreed that when this happens again, I’ll remind you of those times and I’ll hang up. Trust me, it’s for your own good.”

“Did you steal those from my neighbour’s garden?”
“If you mean the one with the really big dog, then yes.”

To make matters worse, Thor’s secret identity (med student Donald Blake) is basically a younger version of the main character from House, right down to the crippled leg, the scrawny physique and the annoying god complex (though in this case it’s somewhat justified).

“Mugging gone wrong?”
She looked up from her inspection of the corpse. “He still has his wallet.”
“Hence the term ‘gone wrong’…”

“Gimme a coping mechanism on the rocks,” she muttered, slumping on the barstool.
“I believe I am unfamiliar with that drink.”

They argued for the last ten minutes of class, very properly of course, and Parkson won when Nyota failed to demonstrate the universal existence of music.
~
“I prefer to limit my time with students who lack proficiency.  The Academy has an excellent language faculty who are as able as I to guide them,” Spock said.  “Are you saying,” Nyota felt a smile edge out as she parsed what was under his words. ”That listening to baby cadets mangle your native language hurts your ears?” “I have never experienced physical pain in the presence of novice pronunciation,” said Spock, arching an eyebrow, but Nyota just grinned. “Not physical pain,” she emphasized and could have sworn Spock’s lips twitched.
~ She had glossy red hair the colour of fire in the daylight and dark satin at night. She wore old boots and farmer’s clothes: denim pants and a flannel shirt, both of which had started out in different shades of blue, but which had since been worn to the universal colour of fade.
~
Her breath sent a sharp flicker of fire and an attendant wisp of smoke into the morning air. Having elected years ago to turn from dragon into raven, she nevertheless decided to keep the fire. 
~ He’d always select his brightest clothes to wear, unless and until specifically ordered out of them. And then he’d put them on again as soon as he determined the term covered by that order had probably expired. 
~
“All except the black one, of course. He’s stubborn and doesn’t know how to mind like the others. I don’t know why I keep him. One shouldn’t become fond of stupid and stubborn things.” By then Peter knew exactly what was coming next. “I named him Peter,” she announced. 
~
Bo always cooked a big dinner, full of his favourite dishes, when she knew they were going to fight. She also brought out the good china. It’s as if she calculated that it was something nice she could do to partially offset all of the horrible things she might end up saying. Of course, like most men, Peter didn’t care what quality of dinnerware he ate from, so that part of her gesture was always lost on him. 
~
“That’s such an easy promise to make, which is why it’s both insipid and unfair. It’s a no-lose deal for you. Either you do come back and you’re the big hero who’s kept his promise, or you die horribly, and I have to instantly forgive you, because I’d be a heartless bitch if I didn’t. I couldn’t even remotely resent the fact that you failed to keep your word. You get out of any consequences scot-free.”
“Well, except for the part where I die horribly,” he said, trying on a crooked smile—the one she liked best. 
“Well, yes, except for that part. Don’t you dare try to make me laugh, Peter. I’m not done arguing and I don’t want to like you yet.”
~ It was someone he recognized, by the name of Kurt if one of the adults spoke to him, but whom Max and Peter had to address as Mr. Morganslaughtern. He was carrying a small framed portrait painting of Mrs. Cresentia Peep in one hand and a paring knife in the other. What he planned to do with either of those items no one could tell, perhaps not even Morganslaughtern himself. 
~
“Why should I bother calling out?” she said, with a wicked grin. “You’d likely not recognize my voice anyway.”
“Are we going to discuss that again?” His smile matched hers. “I hadn’t seen you in ten years. It was dark. There was a bloody damned stone wall between us—an exceptionally thick one at that. You were whispering. And your mouth, along with your whole face, was swaddled in that long black scarf you like to wrap around your head as a mask.”
“I have white-blonde hair and perfect alabaster skin that shoes up like a lit candle, even in the darkest rooms. I need a mask in order to skulk about in the night. But, granting all of those fine excuses you constructed, you’d still think a man would know the voice of his own true love.”
“Please, oh eternal light of my life, get into the damned pumpkin.”
~
“Look, unless you’re getting some sort of sexual pleasure from this self-flagellation, stop beating yourself up about it. You can’t change the past; you made a stupid decision and now you’re going to live with it.”
~ Arthur was in full mail and armour, including his helmet. The helmet was currently being gnawed by something that had been the butcher from the town before he’d died of the pox last spring. Arthur stabbed him through the heart for the fourth time on the off chance he’d remember to die this time. But he ignored the sword and kept trying to chew his way through Arthur’s helmet. Arthur stabbed him one more time on the grounds that in a fair and proper world things stabbed by Arthur would die.
~ From outside they could just make out the sounds of a scuffle, and if they hadn’t barricaded the entrance with every item of furniture Morgana owned they would have been able to make out the following argument: 
“They’ve barricaded the bloody door!” 
“Of course they’ve barricaded the door, there are zombies everywhere.” 
~ “He cast the spell to raise the dead. I saw it in a dream.” 
“Why haven’t you told Arthur?” 
“When should I have told him? After I told him I can start fires with my mind, but before he had my head cut off?” 
“Arthur wouldn’t...” Merlin trailed off. He was certain Arthur wouldn’t hand either him or Morgana over to the executioner. He was almost certain. Almost probably certain. “I’ll think of something to tell him.” 
~ It was a matter of constant amazement to Merlin that Arthur—who was heir to an entire kingdom and was, Merlin had to admit, quite handsome if you liked that sort of thing—was so utterly rubbish at talking to women. 
~
“Normally at this point I’d tell the audience to go buy a copy, your book is on the shelves now, but with the way these things are selling, that might not be the case.”

“I can’t decide how I’m going to kill you,” she grumbled as she put on the disguise.
“If anyone asks, you’re my personal chef and eunuch Gregory.”
“Bare hands it is.”

“Percy,” he started, “I don’t pretend to understand prophecies—”
“Yeah,” I said, “well, maybe that’s because they don’t make any sense.”
~ Richie slid the snack bowl toward Methos. “No old man, I mean how do you not die of boredom?”
“The operative word there being ‘die’. Not something I intend to do.” He saluted Richie with his drink and took a swig.
Richie knew that Methos was just being his witty, evasive self. But the future just looked like one big dull march toward nothing and he needed to understand what drove Methos to keep going after 5,000 years. “But why not die? Haven’t you lived long enough?”
Methos responded with mock seriousness, “Excuse me? You’re not actually challenging me are you?”
“What? No…Methos... I’m just bored… and…,” Richie sputtered into silence.
Methos chuckled and clapped him on the back. “You’re too young to be having a mid-life crisis, my friend. By the time I was your age-”
“I know, you’d conquered half the known world,” Richie finished before returning to the important task of peeling the label from his beer. “Not exactly an option these days.”
Methos smiled, “You work with what you’re given. And I’m not suggesting you over throw a small government. Though,” he paused thoughtfully,” if you do, can you start with France because I owe them about seventy thousand euros.”
Richie stared at Methos in the mirror over the bar. In the reflection, Methos’ face seemed older; less the callow youth he tried to portray to everyone. “Back taxes?”
Methos dug through the peanut bowl. “Apparently, they consider their library books government property.”
Richie pulled the bowl from him and fished a pretzel from the bottom. “You could just return them.”
“Oh no. First I’d have to remember where they were.” Methos shrugged. “And then I’d have to actually care.” He reached for the peanuts again. “Easier if you just conquer the country and then give me amnesty.”

“Are you a medical doctor?” Bobby interrupted.
“What? Oh. No. My doctorates are in….”
“Well, where’s the damn medical doctor, so we can get this done?” Bobby said impatiently.
~
“No, ‘ta-da’ is what you say when something good happens.”
~
“Oh, she’s texting and walking. She’s going to walk into the pool. Ma’am, ma’am…”
“Eh, you’d be surprised how often that happens. It’s ok; because of the prevalence of breast implants, no one drowns.”
~
“Are you a lesbian?”
“You mean because I’m not dressed like I have a stripper-pole in my room?”
~
“I really appreciate your concern, but I’m not possessed. Look, this is as far as I can move my head.”
~
“Go away! Nobody understands me!” she yelled at him. 
“Well, that’s probably because your face is in a pillow and the volume of this music is about to burst my eardrums.”
~
“All they care about is how they look or what they drive or how they look in what they drive.”
~ “I’m telling you, there’s no such thing as aliens,” Bobby said. “This is some kind of mass delusion, or everyone is under some kind of demonic spell or something.” Dean used the towel that Bobby handed him to wipe enough goo off his face to see. “I’m thinking maybe this is aliens, Bobby,” he said. Bobby threw up his hands in disgust. “If your father were here,” he started, and stopped when Sam pointed skyward. “I know, I see it,” Bobby griped. “I’m telling you, it just ain’t real.” Sam pointed to his left, where the crashed ship was still smoking. “I see that too,” Bobby said. “This has gotta been some kind of powerful spell. Or maybe it’s mass hypnosis or something. In fact, maybe the government cooked this whole thing up, brainwashed us while we were watching American Idol.” “You watch American Idol?” Dean asked, while Sam aimed his rifle and nailed the thing crawling out of the wreckage right between its large black eyes.
~
When he spotted the boy—looking sheepish, with a duffel slung over one shoulder—he knew this was the wrong week to quit smoking. “Dear God, no.”
“Nice to see you too,” said Cub mildly, undeterred.
~
Apparently, the man had been watching them with morbid fascination. He was now clearing his throat. “I didn’t know Cub was your son.”
“He isn’t,” the sergeant snapped, at the same time Cub said, “I’m his illegitimate love child; of course you wouldn’t’ve known.”
Eagle stared back and forth between them.
“He isn’t,” stressed the sergeant.
“Okay,” said Eagle uncertainly.
~ Kirk slams his beer to the desk with force enough to rattle the model of the Enterprise that sits atop the pile of papers next to him. Spock regards him from the rim of his cup of tea, waiting for an explanation which comes in the form of, “This is bullshit.” “If you do not enjoy the taste of your beverage,” Spock says, “I suggest you stop drinking it.”
~
“I’m going to assume that was a rhetorical question. I’m also going to assume that you don’t know what rhetorical means.”

“Try not to kill anyone while I’m gone.”
“When you’re gone, I won’t want to kill anyone.”
~
“Prongs,” said Remus, turning to his friend, “I request permission to kill your first-born son.”
James pulled out his wand. “Hell with permission, I’ll help you.”
~ “So,” Eames interrupts. “Don’t bore me with the petty details. Just tell me what sort of masks we’ll all be wearing while we rob this bank. I hope it’s not dead U.S. presidents. That’s so overdone.”
“We are not robbing a bank,” Arthur corrects. “Cobb and I are robbing a bank. You are going to be a hostage.” Eames looks Arthur up and down with smirk. “Kinky.” Arthur turns to Cobb. “Do we really need…” “Yes, we do,” Cobb says. “I really don’t like him.” “I hadn’t noticed,” Cobb replies with a small smile. Eames throws an arm around Arthur’s shoulder. “You love me.” “Fuck off and die,” Arthur says calmly.
~ They have a frantic conversation with hand gestures and Arthur is pretty sure that he promised Cobb either his soul or the entire contents of his wine cellar in Buenos Aires before Cobb relents and lets Arthur drag Eames away to the back room.
~
“I don’t like to discuss my age, Sam. I’m like a lady in that respect.” I stopped and felt the need to backtrack, “In that respect only.”
~ “Cancel—it’s a new Cantonese fusion place.” She picked up her coat, “It’s supposed to be amazing. Bruce pulled strings to get a table.”
He was busy at his desk, packing his briefcase, “What’d he do? Buy it?”
She nodded, “Of course.”
~
“Why would you think that, Clark? Superman doesn’t lie. He never lies.”
As the doors closed behind him, Clark reached up to remove his glasses. “Yes, I do. All the time.”
~ “Bruce says the percentage risk of failure is very high.”
Clark’s head cocked slightly to the side, “Diana? What does she say?”
Lois looked grave. “That she would have more confidence if you had been created by the Goddesses. And were a woman.”
~
“What’s a fancy way of saying ‘stupid as all get-out’?” James scratches out a line of his essay.
“‘Incurably obtuse.’” Remus twirls his quill in idle fingers.
~
“What do you think?” James squints.  The mixture burbles ominously. “It’s not very peaceful, is it?” Remus says. According to their notes, Calming Draughts are supposed to come out a peaceful, woodsy green —the colour of the ocean at dawn, the textbook helpfully supplies, or the leaves of an elm tree in midsummer.  “No,” James shakes his head. “I think it’s a bit tweedy, if anything. Or seasick.”
~ “So, Tessa, the bartender, she’s got some good info, but that chick will not take no for an answer.” Dean said, staring into his beer, words spilling out one over the other. “I told her I wasn’t interested. She said I was lying. I told her I’m gay. She said she likes a challenge. I told her I’ve got a jealous boyfriend,” Dean jerked his chin at Sam. “And she said you were invited.”  There was a short, hopeful pause. “No,” Sam said. “We are not having a threesome with the bartender.”
“Right, knew you’d say that,” Dean said. “Plus, it’d be weird. I’ll be right back.”
~ Dean stood in front of the door, re-wrapping his towel where it threatened to slip off his hips. “Remember what that crazy 3rd grade teacher of yours taught you about fighting, Sammy. ‘Words are for people. Hands are for God.’” Dean folded his hands in prayer and looked heavenward in a dead-on impression of Mrs. Leroux. Sam started laughing. “Yeah, and you told me to kick Ricky Maynard’s ass.” Dean grinned and shrugged. “What can I say; I’ve grown as a person.” […]
“Ain’t respectful,” the alpha jock in front of them said, “Jimmy’s name coming out of that dirty cock-sucking mouth.” “Why?” Dean challenged, rolling his neck. “There something else you’d rather put in there?” Sam slotted in against Dean’s back. “Thought you’d grown as a person?” he muttered. “What,” Dean said as the pack of jocks rushed them. “Those were words.”

Then he bent his mouth to hers and kissed her, and the slow heat and delight of the taste of his mouth did away any thought whatsoever. Then, boots thumped up the stairs outside Bernard’s office. One at a time. Loudly. Bernard let out an irritated groan, his eyes closed. 
“Ahem,” coughed Giraldi’s voice from outside. “Achoo. My but what a cold I have. Yes, sir, a cold. I’ll need to see a healer about that.”

“We can’t—get your century to the wall, dress uniform. We aren’t preparing to fight. We’re turning out an honour guard. Understand?”
“Perfectly, Your Excellency,” Giraldi answered. “You want our finest century on the wall in full battle gear so that we can beat some Marat if they’ve got a mind to tussle, and if they don’t, you want your most beautiful and charming centurion doing the greeting to make them feel all welcome.”
“Good man.”

“What are you doing down here?”
Max grinned. “There’s a young widow a couple of streets down. She gets lonely on misty nights.”
“This time of year, every night is misty,” Tavi said.
Max beamed. “I noticed that, too.”
“There’s a reason people hate you.”
“Jealousy is common among lesser men,” Max agreed magnanimously.
~
He pressed the dagger a bit more heavily into the other man’s neck. “I obey his Majesty’s commands regardless of how inconvenient it may be to you. You will release me, Lord Ambassador. I will take your request to His Majesty at the earliest opportunity, and I will bring you his reply personally the instant he release me to do so. Or, if you prefer, I can open your throat, you can tear me to bits, and we will both die for no reason. The choice is yours.”
“Do you think I’m afraid to die?” he asked.
“I think that your death here, like this, will not serve your people.”
“What do you know of my people?”
“That they have bad breath, sir, if you are any indication.”
~
“Oh, it’s you, Countess. Forgive me, but from there you looked like a young man.”
A few years before, the insult to her physique would have stung her sorely. “That’s perfectly all right, Sir Horatio. We all expect men of your age to begin experiencing certain deficiencies.” She bowed to him with courtly grace. 
~
“Are you trying to get me killed?”
“Yes. To tell you the truth, I never had much use for you, Max.” He watched his friend blink at him for a second, then scowl.
“Hah-hah,” said Max. “You’re hilarious.”
“You should know better than that,” he replied. “If there was anyone else I thought could do this, I wouldn’t have gotten you involved.”
“You wouldn’t?” Max asked, his tone suddenly offended. “Why not?”
“Because you’ve known what’s going on for ten seconds and you’re already complaining.”
~
“You’re one of the realm’s spies, then?”
“Darling, I’m merely a glorified pleasure slave, doing the Emperor’s a favour on behalf of her master. And even if I was free, I don’t think I’d have the temperament for the profession. All the heroism and duty and so on. Exhausting.”
Isabelle arched an eyebrow. “I suppose a spy for the Crown would be largely useless if she walked around announcing the fact.”
Sara smiled. “That seems a reasonable statement, darling.”

“You think I passed?”
“I think you should have slept last night,” Evan said primly.

“It’s too hot in there after a long test,” he told Evan. “The air gets all squishy.”

“I haven’t slept in almost two days. It’s squishy.”

“They’re meeting with the king to get approval for more studies of, uh…” Max squinted up his eyes. “Arthritic Beer, I keep thinking, but those aren’t the right words.”
Tim blinked. “Anthropomorphic Theorem?” 
Max nodded again, in exactly the same unconcerned way. “That’s it. I’ve got to learn all about it by the time we walk up to the palace and you’re to teach it to me.”
“Max, that class is required. You took that class. In fact, we had it together. And you were there most of the time.”
“Certainly. It was in the afternoon. I have no objection to education as long as it doesn’t interfere with my sleep.”
“Did you listen?”
“Um, keep in mind that Mara Green sat in the row in front of us. You remember her. The one with the red hair and the big…” He coughed. “Eyes.”
“That was a three-month course. How am I supposed to give you all of that in the next fifteen minutes?”
“Cheerfully and without complaint,” Max replied, grinning.
~
“Um, we don’t need to mention this to anyone do we?”
“Mention what?” Tim said, with a guileless smile.
Max let out a sigh of relief and smiled. “You’re all right, Tim.”
“Nah. For all you know I’ll just blackmail you with it later.”
~
“I noticed that you wear your sword tonight, sir.”
Nate looked baffled. “Gods. Do I?”
“Indeed. And I further notice that your clothing looks a rather great deal like the livery of a coachman.”
“Astonishing,” Nate said, smiling. “Some sort of fascinating coincidence, no doubt.”
“Nate, darling, you’re retired. I have no intention of dragging you into something dangerous. Stay here.”
“I’m afraid I’m not sure what you’re getting at, Lady Sara,” Nate replied affably. “I’m merely walking you to the carriage.” ~
“That is a question rarely asked here in court. Because a man of conscience would tell you that he is a person of conscience. And a man of ambition would tell you that he is a person of conscience—only much more convincingly.”
~ One corner of her mouth quirked into a tiny smile. “It’s nice to see you took my advice about offering compliments to ladies.”
“I have found it to be a most effective tactic, my lady.” 
She arched an eyebrow, and said, “I’ve created a monster.”
“Ladies sometimes scream,” Max said loftily. “But other than that, I would hardly say that I was a monster.”

“You just said that you intend to kill him anyway. How stupid do I look to you?”
“That’s a rhetorical question, right?”
~
“Anton, you are an idiot. But I am glad you have returned.”
Anton asked, warily, “Are you going to hit me, too?”
“Naturally not,” Killian replied. “You were injured tonight. Though I will hit you when the crisis is past if it makes you feel better.”
~
“No, I’m not sure about this. But, then again, what is sure in this life?”
Don smiled, his teeth a sudden white gleam. “Death,” he said.
~
“No other woman in the realm can lay claim to the same title.”
“No other woman in the realm knows my recipe for spice-bread either, but no one says anything about that.”
~
“Turk,” he said, his tone pleased. “You’ve employed a euphemism. Next thing you know, you’ll be showing signs of sagacity.”
Turk was silent for a blank second, then said, “Thank you?”
~ He spent the next few hours seeing pretty colours and feeling all fuzzy like a blanket. Or maybe fuzzy like a teddy bear?

“The peoples shall burn,” Sam muttered unhelpfully, brow furrowed.
~
“You’re first on their emergency contact list. I don’t know if you deserve that spot. What’s the normal body temperature for a baby?”
“94 to 100.7”
“The cure for colic?”
“Gripe water.”
“When was the last time you were certified in baby CPR?”
“I teach baby CPR.”
~
“I can see why you eat organic. Who knew artichoke had a taste? I thought it was just a harder way to drink butter.”

“Get me a scotch and soda, and yes, I know we’re out of soda.”

“Security!”
“Hey, you think he wants me to play a security guard?”
“I think this rather large gentleman might already have the part.”

“I haven’t been in one of these movie trailers since I did that thing with Woody Allen.”
“You were in one of his movies?”
“Oh, he better not have filmed that.”
~
“Make-up? I thought you were going for the natural look?”
“Well, yeah, but making it looks like I’m not wearing make-up takes twice as long.”
~
“That was a memorable party, wasn’t it?”
“Oh honey, you know I never remember the memorable ones.”
~
“You’re wasting your time. She’s waiting for Mr. Right. She’s very patient.”
~
“I have a lot of ideas for your present.”
“Can one of them be that you don’t pick it out?”

“Whatever farm animal of war, Lana!”

“If your apartment is hit by a dolphin, do not go to see if the dolphin is ok. That’s how the hurricane tricks you into coming outside.”

“Every week is shark week,” said an exasperated seal.

“But you’re so good with him.” Lily said with a frown, running her hand over his hair. 
“Yes, because I can give him back at the end of the day.” 
“Don’t listen to him, Lily.” James said with a smirk. “If it wasn’t for this war, Sirius would have nicked Harry long ago. Might I remind you of the little incident when he tried to kidnapped him a few months back? Brilliant plan hiding him under your robes, by the way.” 
“That would have worked just fine if he hadn’t started to sneeze.” Sirius scowled at James. 
~
“Don’t look at me like that. It’s unsettling when you’re that sincere.”
~
“You’re the cop’s kid.”
“Or Josh…” The thug levelled the gun in his direction. “But ‘the cop’s kid’ works. I can live with that.”
~ “Why is it on our front lawn?”
“He said we could build it here!”
“He has no jurisdiction on our front lawn.”
~ “We don’t care for Jeremy. He’s a bit difficult,” she said. 
“Jeremy’s a fart face,” he added.

“A blocked IP address? Can you—” “Of course I can. I’m Asian.” ~ “Well, if true love was that easy, I guess we’d all have it.” ~
“Quite right. My apologies,” he said, acerbically, “How dare I cast aspersions at the person who robbed me.” ~ “We’ll talk about your insubordination later. Do you know what insubordination means? No? It means you’re grounded.” ~
“All chefs are bad boys. We play with knives and fire.” ~ “I now realise why no one sleeps on a futon after college. And I’ve started making a list of the things I need.

That’s more than I can say about her other boyfriends.” “By ‘other’, you mean ‘previous’, right?” ~ “Look, every artist had to have that first person who saw their talent and gave them a chance: Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo—” “If you say Donatello, I’ll know you’re just citing ninja turtles.” ~

“I love the man, but he refuses to get a smart-phone. Thinks technology distracts us from living in the moment, which I always thought was the point.”
~
“If we’re being this open and honest with each other, I have to tell you that I’m wearing your socks and I have no plans to return them.”
~
“No, he doesn’t have a crush on you. He didn’t say anything. Honestly, I think he’s freaked out by you.”
“So he’s thinking about me!”
~
“No, thanks. I don’t dance. I’m from that town in Footloose.”
~
“You’re a good guy…you know, if you ignore all of the things you do on purpose.”

“You tell anyone we held hands, I have two people in my phone that will kill you.”
~
“Audrey! You’re alive!” Duke tells her, striding across the room and sweeping her up into a bear hug. “You’re really alive!”
“Yes ... did you come all the way here to tell me that?” Audrey laughs.
“No. Yes. I thought you weren’t.” Duke doesn’t care that he’s not really making sense at the moment. But a few very interesting details are filtering through to his conscious brain. Like the reason Nathan’s not wearing a shirt is that Audrey seems to be wearing it instead; that and very little else. Duke grins, looking from Audrey to Nathan, and back to Audrey again. “Sorry to interrupt. You two should go back to ... whatever you were doing.” Nathan turns an interesting shade of red, but Audrey just puts her hands on her hips and glares at Duke. She has nice legs. Nathan’s a lucky man.
~
“Goodness, if you got much taller, they’d have to raise all the ceilings in here.”
Tom shook his head, gravely. “Nonsense. This is the Legion. The ceiling is at regulation height. It is the responsibility of every legionnaire to be sure that he is at regulation height as well.”
~ She took a deep breath. “There’s something we need to talk about.”
His face turned red. “Look, a lot of that is just rumour. I mean, the men get to talking over drinks and every little story grows in the retelling.” She blinked at him. “I mean, it’s not like I’m hosting revels or anything. Everyone likes a good story like that, and the truth of it isn’t as much fun. 
“Tom,” she said in a firm voice, “What in the wide world are you talking about?”
He froze with his mouth open for a second. Acute chagrin flooded him in a wave she could practically see. Then he swallowed, and said, “Um, nothing?” She arched an eyebrow at him. 
~ The woman had one hand clamped resolutely over her eyes. “Captain?” she called. “Karen told me not to look at you when you were unclothed. How am I supposed to know whether or not you are unclothed without looking?”
Tom gave Karen a level look. “Oh for pity’s sake. It’s alright, Enna. You can look.”
“Thank goodness,” Enna said, dropping her hand. Then she gave him a disappointed little frown and sighed. “I miss all the best parts.”
“Soldier,” he prompted.
She gave him a quick salute. “The man who none of us saw and who none are going to remember is here to see you, sir.”
~ Evan burst out with a laugh. It died young, as he watched Tom’s expression. “Oh,” he said. “You were serious. Look, your confidence is flattering, but even if I could get close to him, which I don’t think I could, I’m not at all sure I could take him. I’ve seen him fight.”
“No, no,” Tom said. “If I wanted him assassinated, I’d do it myself.” He paused to consider. “Or possible send Max or Kevin.”
“For you,” Evan said, “that was an uncommonly sensible afterthought.”
~
‘Obviously,’ he thought. But that wasn’t the sort of remark one could make to a superior officer without making him look like the ass he was. So, he remained silent.
~
“How on earth did you convince the barbarians to wear clothes, much less uniforms?”
“They have very formal conventions with regards to the giving of gifts, sir. If one is given a gift and does not put it to use, it is considered a kind of insult to the gift-giver. So I went around to each of them and personally gave them their uniform and armour.” He shrugged. “They have to wear it now, or they’ll be insulting me. They’re too polite to do that.”
~ The two of them were sparring shirtless, apparently to keep Edward from having all of his shirts torn to ribbons and stained with blood.
~ Her fingertips almost ached with raw desire to trace those muscles. Instead, she turned back to her sewing, where both her eyes and her fingers would have less trouble behaving in an appropriate manner. 
~
Cameron gave him a very direct look. “Soldier, I hereby order you to stop whining.”
~ He frowned up at her. “You knew? But I never told you.”
She yawned. “Please. It is not as if you are horribly complex. I have ears and a mind. If I waited for you to speak to me about everything important, it would probably drive me insane.”
~
“I am your enemy,” he growled. “If you die to protect me, I will lose all respect for you.”
~
He blinked several times at the bowl and looked up and around him. He was back in his tent and it was morning again—a different morning, he thought. The past two days were little but mist in his memory; a few solid points, with many hours of nothingness in between. 
~
He lifted his eyebrows. “I’ve had a number of men report that you hacked the shaft off that javelin in your belly and kept giving orders for more than an hour. It wasn’t until we started pushing them back that you let them take you to the healers.”
Marcus blinked. He remembered nothing of that. “Well. That wasn’t real smart of me.”
~
He blinked. “Excuse me? Countess, I believe that I am perfect—” He broke off, ,coughing again, struggling to smother the sound with his hands. The sound became ugly for just a moment, and then he got himself under control again. “You may,” he breathed, “have a point.”
~
“I always enjoy working with his kind. They pay on time and almost never try to kill me afterward.”
~
She shrugged. “There was nothing to it. He made advances. I objected.”
The other woman arched an eyebrow. “I see. At what point did your objections draw his blood?”
“Here,” she said, drawing a finger across her chin. “And another you can’t see, right about…” she started untucking her shirt from her trousers.
~
“All that fuss about the men in a separate room. I should have shared a room with mine, and you with yours. We all would have been happier. Though I suppose we might not have gotten things done quite as quickly.” She tilted her head and gave Alex a frank appraisal. “How is he with his mouth? Mine needs practice.” 
Alex looked considerably more shaken than when he’d received his hideous belly wound. “Um, ladies,” he said. “Excuse me.” He hurried down the gangplank at a pace that was probably causing him pain. 
~
The Senator’s thugs, she thought, lacked refinement. She had expected to be bound, of course, but they could have at least found a clean cloth with which to hood her. She blinked and considered that thought for a moment. Had she really become so jaded with to the dangers of politics that she felt herself qualified to criticise the nuances of her own abduction. She couldn’t help it. She found herself shaking with silent laughter. 
Alex stirred beside her. “What is it?” he murmured.
“I’m just appreciating the irony of human nature. Particularly, our ability to face enormous adversity, yet retain the capacity to complain about the little things.”
“Ah,” he said, “I wondered if they made these hoods out of old horse blankets as well.”
~ Tim grinned. “Are you with me?”
“The plan is insane,” Evan said. “You are insane.” He looked around the inside of the tent. “I’ll need some pants.”
~
“Can you win?” she whispered.
The boy smiled crookedly. “I’ve never lost a duel to the death. Not one.”
~
Max shook his head. “There’s something broken in your skull, boy. You do all your thinking sideways.”
~ Kevin thought wistfully of murder. The other man cursed his horse savagely, kicking harder than necessary with his heels and jerking hard on the reins to bring it under control. Kevin idly added theoretical torture to the theoretical murder, because, if done right, it might be funny. 
~
“The lessons have gone well. And without serious incident,” she said. He frowned faintly. His standards on that subject differed rather sharply from her. To her, without serious incident merely meant that no one had been killed. 
~
“Your Highness, perhaps I should explain: my duty is to the Crown. And my orders, from the Crown, are to take every action within my power to support you, protect you, and secure every possible advantage to ensure your safety and success.” He added, without a trace of apology, “Including, if in my best judgment I deem it necessary, ignoring orders containing more idealism than practicality.”
James stared at him for a moment. Then he said, quietly, “Marcus, I’m not feeling will. But, I’m sure if I ask nicely, when Adam gets back, he will be happy to throw you off this ship for me.” Marcus inclined his head, unruffled. 
~
Marcus debated the proper way to inform the young officer that there was, in fact, a distinction between telling someone that they had a poor sense of smell and informing him that he smelled bad.
~
“I don’t care if it’s never been done before,” Bernard told him, “Once you do it, no one will be able to say that again, now will they?”
The engineer ground his teeth. “Your Excellency, you must understand—”
Bernard’s eyes narrowed. “I understand that if you speak one more word to me in that condescending tone of voice, I’m going to roll up these plans and shove them so far up your—”
“Assuming that you aren’t too busy,” Alanna interjected smoothly, “I wonder if I may have a quiet moment with you, my lord husband.”
~
“No,” she said, when he did not smile in return. “Gavin has some insane errand for you.”
“We got here late, and the sane ones were already taken,” he replied, forcing a smile to his mouth.
~
“It’s pronounced with a single syllable,” Marcus corrected him absently. “It’s another of those words one has to growl from between clenched teeth to speak properly.”
“Does it really make a difference?”
“Since we will be making landfall there, perhaps we should make it a point to pronounce the name of our hosts’ home properly, as opposed to offering them an insult every time we speak it.”
~
“There is no great secret to sailing in the leviathans’ waters. We chart their ranges and we respect them. The territory one claims and defends is important. We understand that. The leviathans understand that. Se we respect their claim.”
“Must make for some complex sailing routes.”
Grover shrugged. “Respect is elder to convenience.”
“And besides, if you didn’t respect them, they’d eat you.”
“Survival is also elder to convenience,” Grover agreed.
~ She leaned over the side of the longboat, and kissed him hard on the mouth, her fingers tight in his hair for a moment. Then, she broke it off abruptly, met his eyes, and said, “Survive.”
He winked at her. “I’ll be fine.”
“Of course he will,” Max said. “If there’s a lick of trouble, he’ll set something on fire—it’s easy to set something on fire, believe me—and I’ll see the smoke, knock down all the buildings between him and the dock, come get him, and we’ll leave. Nothing simpler.”
She gave Max a steady look. Then she shook her head and said, “And the truly incredible part is…you actually believe it.”
“In the course of my life,” Max said, “I more than once have been too ignorant to now that something was impossible before I did it anyway. I see no reason to jeopardize this success.”
~ The king, his expression calm, leaned over to look out the coach’s window. “I would seem that we’re under attack,” he called out.
“But we’re still miles from their territory!” Evan protested.
“Yes,” he replied. “Rather inconsiderate of them.”
~
“No, I suppose it’s because for so long we were…” Her cheeks flushed. “Improper.”
“Illicit lover,” Bernard said, not without a certain amount of satisfaction. “Frequent illicit lovers.”
~
“I’ve got blisters and muscle cramps in places not meant for the touch of anything but a beautiful woman,” Max spat back, sullenly. “I’ve bitten my tongue so many times in the past three days that I whistle in musical chords when I exhale. And the smell isn’t ever going to come out of my armour, I just know it. Where, precisely, is the bright side?”
Carver considered that gravely. Then he offered, “If nothing else, they’ve given you something legitimate to complain about.”
~
Then they left them there, on the flat, open expanse of the cubic building’s roof. Bruce didn’t need to look to know that there would be no way to climb down, no other building close enough to leap onto. There was no need for bars, locks, or guards. One would need to be able to fly to escape this prison cell.
Clark stared at the closed door for a moment, then said, “They can’t possibly be serious.”
Diana nodded. “It does seem a tad ingenious. A trap?”
“They’re trapping us into taking advantage of an opening that will give us a chance to warn our people and possibly escape?” Bruce asked. “That’s clever of them. They don’t know what we’re capable of doing, do they?”
“They believe you to be the equivalent of their sorcerers. Their sorcerers cannot fly, therefore, you cannot either.”
“If one of our people is missing when he comes back., he might take it badly,” Diana pointed out.
“I took being imprisoned and sentenced to death badly. It’s going around.”
~
“One can retire from whoredom,” the woman replied, her tone cool. “Idiocy is for life—which in your case, is probably about thirty minutes.”
~
“He gets to choose how the duel will be fought.” Duncan continued, as if no one had said anything. “He’s chosen steel and magic, which basically means anything goes, which is how fighting is supposed to be done anyway. As the challenger, she gets to choose the time and place of the duel. She has chosen here and now. Obviously. Or none of us would be standing out here in this wind. As the challenged, you have the right to let a champion stand in your place. In case you don’t want to get hurt, I guess.” Duncan’s tone was completely neutral and polite, but somehow the barbarian managed to infuse it with contempt, nonetheless. 
~
“You never asked me why I was preparing to move my troops south. Why I had decided to trust my people’s safety to your word. You just got out of bed, changed your bandages, and demanded a horse so you could come along.”
“Politely,” she said. “I demanded politely. I distinctly remember using the word ‘please’.”
~
“Shall I throw him back into his boat?” Nathan asked. There was a somewhat wistful note to his voice.
~
“Spies do not exist to circumvent the law, but to preserve its spirit against its letter.”
~
He lay quietly on his back, staring up at the stars. Given that he was lying on the floor of a cavern, it probably wasn’t a good sign. He searched his alleged memory for an explanation as to why he might be doing such a thing, and why the stars were so brilliant and swirling around so quickly, but he seemed to have misplaced that fact. Perhaps the aching bump he felt swelling on his skull had dislodged his memory. The stars had begun to wink out. Perhaps there was weather moving in. He’d have  been concerned about rain if he wasn’t already in a cave—which again brought up the question about where the bloody stars had come from. 
~
“On the contrary, flight is quite simple.” Her lips curved into an amused smile. “Surviving the landing is less so.”
~ She stalked over to him and placed her fists upon her hips. “I have been speaking to Celeste. She informs me that you have been treating me like a whore.”
Tim blinked. Several times. “Um. What?”
“Don’t you dare play innocent with me,” she spat. “If anyone is in a position to know, it’s Celeste. I am informed that the fact that we have been together for so long will be the source of much mockery and outrage among your people. They universally regard me as the Prince’s whore.” She scowled. “I will not be treated this way,” she snarled. “You idiot. You face problems enough in assuming the crown without giving your enemies such an obvious weakness to exploit. How dare you allow me to be a means by which you are brought to harm?” Tim just stared at her helplessly. The anger faded from her expression. “Of course,” she said, her voice very quiet, “this all assumes that you intend me to be your wife.”
“Honestly, Katherine, I hadn’t…I hadn’t even thought about it.”
Her eyes widened. Her mouth dropped open in an expression of something almost like horror. “You…you hadn’t?” She swallowed. “You plan to marry another?”
He felt his own eyes widen. “No. No, god, no. I hadn’t considered it because I never thought it would end any other way. I mean, it wasn’t even a question to me, beloved.”
For an instant, her uncertainty was replaced with relief. And then that expression gave way to another in turn: she narrowed her eyes dangerously. “You just assumed I would do it.” Tim winced. Again. Clearly anything he said would only make things worse.
~ Tim scowled. “You’re only taking her side because she’s a girl.”
“Yes,” Fiona said, smiling. “I may be no expert, but I have learned enough of your ways to know which side of this debate I am obliged to support.”
~ Anita suppressed an irrationally intense urge to use a spell to choke of the Senator’s supply of air. She supposed she didn’t absolutely need to choke him. Not fatally, anyway. She might be satisfied enough with merely watching him turn purple and collapse—but the man was so detestable that she scarcely trusted herself. So instead of murder, or a peasant near murder, she folded her hands calmly in her lap and forced herself to remain calm. 
Bernard leaned over, and murmured, “If I asked you politely, do you think you could strangle that smug idiot from all the way up here?”
~
“Too difficult to push him under the runners of the sled without being seen? It’s impossible. I spent the last two days looking for the opportunity. He hides in his cabin, surrounded by sycophants. Cowardly.” He paused a beat, and allowed, “If practical.”
~
“Can’t retire yet, the work isn’t done. Maybe I’ll get lucky and catch an arrow in the eye.”
David’s bland face barely showed a shadow of a smile. “That’s the spirit.”
~ Evan’s stomach twisted. “He’s dying.”
“He’s also lying right here, listening to you,” came Andrew’s voice, weak and amused. “I’d ask you to quit speaking over my head, but in my current condition you have little choice.”
~
“Terrible, isn’t it? On a scale of one to ten, ten being the most revolting and one being almost edible, I believe that rating this recipe would require the use of exponents.”
~
“Carver,” Tim rasped. His throat felt dry. It hurt to talk. “Report.”
“I hurt,” Carver said, his voice slurring and weak. He closed his eyes again. “End of report.”
~ Holly looked like a cat presenting its owner with a particularly juicy dead sparrow, Dean thought privately. He didn’t say it, though; when you mocked the junior accountants for their enthusiasm, he had learned, they stopped going above and beyond, and inevitably you had to start doing your own work again. So he smiled, thanked her effusively, and waited until she left to demand of the stuffed alligator on his desk, “Who likes doing shit like this? Seriously. That girl was wired wrong.”
~
“Before you leave today, I want all your Monday reports in my inbox.” Dean swallowed. “But it’s Wednesday.” “Did you do them Monday?” “No.” “Did you do them Tuesday?” “No.” “Then do them today, Dean.”
~ “You know, I bet if I lost a hand in this thing they’d replace it,” Dean said, reaching in after the fourth paper jam that morning. “It’d almost be worth it.”
~ The only thing in the entire spreadsheet was a note in all caps: TOLD YOU I DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO DO IT. “Damn it,” Dean said. “I need better minions.”
~
“Did I mention yet that you’re crazy?” Sam pointed at the shotgun in Dean’s hand. “Says the man who just filled a ghost full of rock salt.” “I haven’t ruled out that I’m crazy too.” Dean shoved his glasses back into place. “Maybe I fell asleep at my desk again and I’m dreaming all this on top of my depreciation projections.”
~
“I called everyone you, Dad, and I had ever met. I visited voodoo practitioners and mediums from here to central Mexico. I tried scrying for you—” “I don’t know what that means.” “A, yes you do, and B, it’s hard! And it didn’t work.”
~
“Sam,” Dean said under his breath. The god stalked closer. Sam was digging through his bag. “Sam!”
“I’m working on it.” Dean inched back until he was flat against the filing cabinets. Shai loomed above him. “Good to know.” As the god reached for Dean, both Sam and Dean emptied their guns into him. Shai didn’t seem to have noticed. “Plan B?” Dean called to Sam. “Hang on!” Sam shouted back, and dove behind a set of shelves.  “Shit!” Dean started after him, but a huge hand on the back of his shirt yanked him back. “Sam!” “I said hang on!” Dean looked down, exasperated, at where he was clutching the edge of a filing cabinet. “I am!”
~
“What’d you do? Call down the wrath of—something?” “Pretty much.”
~
“The goddess of destiny and fate. Shai’s partner, counterpart, or wife, depending on who you’re reading.” Dean had to hand it to him—not many people could sound like an encyclopaedia while whispering. Dean risked a look back at the two gods, who had thankfully completely forgotten there were other people in the room and were shouting at each other. Meskhenet tended to punctuate a lot of her angrier sentences with bursts of flame, he noticed. “I vote wife.”
~
Now that the spectacles had been destroyed, everyone seemed to be getting their memories back. Holly, a former occult tattoo artist who didn’t want to go back to her old life. “Who says you have to?” Sam pointed out sensibly. “You still remember all the accounting things, right?” Holly looked at him like he was the Dalai Lama. (“Wired wrong,” Dean muttered.) Caro, who was headed back to her magic shop to take on the owner who’d whammied her for asking the wrong questions. From the look in her eye and the Latin she was mumbling under her breath, he was going to have some serious explaining to do. Dean made sure she had his phone number, just in case. Nancy, whose hunter husband arrived just as the last of the building collapsed and swept her off in a cloud of mingled tears and curses. Matt, who had volunteered for this gig as a sort of self-inflicted Witness Protection program, and kept looking over his shoulder as he begged bus fee off of Dean. (“Did he say gnomes?” Sam asked Dean. “I don’t want to know,” Dean replied.)

Warnings: extreme self-indulgence, angsty emo (mostly Jack), character death (also mostly Jack), child endangerment, mentions of torture circa The Year That Never Was, sentence fragments, and believe it or not given the other warnings, massive amounts of fluff.

Jonathan puffed up with outrage. “I will squander my fortune where I damn well please.”

“Welcome to your first day at Rowdy’s Grocery. Just remember, if you’re honest and work hard…you’ll be mocked and ridiculed by all the other employees.”
~ This is the ginormous gummi bear on a stick I bought this morning. His name is Harold and he lives with me now. I can’t decide if my favourite thing about him is merely that he exists, that he’s a whole half-pound of gummi bear on a stick, or that his listed serving size is “1/4 bear,” leading me to wonder how one eats only 1/4 of a ginormous gummi bear on a stick. I won’t be eating him. I will, however, freely admit to thoughts of removing him from the package, taking the stick out of his ass, buying some teeny-tiny gummi bears, and having him lord over them like the Great Gooey God of Gummi.

~
“Obviously, you didn’t pay attention at the last sexual harassment seminar.”
“That’s a lie. I totally did. Thought it was a great How To guide. Come on, man, you gotta lighten up. And that’s going to be really difficult for you because you’re really white already.”

“Well, I mean it depends. Do you want to get with her or be with her? Does she pass the grocery store test?”
“I don’t know. What happens at the grocery store?”
“Absolutely nothing. But, if you want to go with her anyway, that’s how you know you want to be with her.”
~ “Saying ‘I told you so’ is more your thing than mine,” Sam says, and it’s true. “I gave it up for Lent, anyway.”
~ JJ knew that raised eyebrow; it was the same expression she saw when he came back from a budget meeting or the latest seminar on developing a proper work-personal life balance Strauss had forced the team to attend. Morgan called it the “eyebrow of death,” Garcia the “shit just got real brow,” Prentiss the “brow of last resort.” Reid just called it “Khan” for some reason (she knew better to ask at this point). She’d never asked Rossi. JJ knew better than to name it, she just tried to contain the fallout it produced. Gabert must have realized the irritation contained within that one facial expression as well, because he suddenly couldn’t explain fast enough.

“I’m fine, the doctors just want to keep me here overnight as a precaution.” She frowned. “How’d you get out?” she asked Dean. “Against medical advice,” Sam replied grumpily. “Because he’s an idiot with a traumatic brain injury, why not ignore the professionals?”
~
“Well....” Wilson studied the labs more carefully. “There’s no obvious sign of infection or metabolic disorders. Heart appears to be functioning normally. There’s no sign of….” Wilson looked up at House with an incredulous grimace. “What the hell’s up with his EEG?” “If I knew that, I might know what’s wrong with him.” “You do have a neurologist on your staff. What did Foreman say?” “I believe his exact words were: what the hell’s up with this EEG?”
~ “I sent them home. And I haven’t lied to you.” “Your last name isn’t Bates.” “I haven’t lied about anything except my last name,” Dean said without missing a beat.
~ “Sam’s not crazy,” Dean said instantly. Just because a guy had visions and chased zombies did not mean he was crazy. A freak, maybe, but not crazy. Then he hesitated, head tilted to the side as he considered the ramifications of pleading insanity. “Wait. So...if Sam’s nuts, then you’ll help me get him out of here?” “In a nutshell,” House agreed. “Sam’s crazy as a loon,” Dean said instantly. “Total whack job.”
~
“It was a dark and stormy night,” House intoned from the passenger seat as the Impala’s headlights cut through a heavy mist.  “It’s not stormy,” Wilson observed from the back seat where he was struggling to keep Sam’s unconscious body from jack-knifing onto the floor. “A little foggy, maybe....” “You have the soul of an accountant,” House said darkly.
~ “Of course it was a dog,” House said. “If it wasn’t a dog it would’ve changed back into its zombie form when Dean killed it.  “How do you know that?” “Duh. That’s what happens in all the horror movies. If you kill a werewolf it turns back into a man.” “Well, as long as you’re basing it on sound, scientific knowledge.”
~ “So where are we headed?” Sam asked as Dean turned the car east. “Atlantic City.” “What’s in Atlantic City?” “Atlantic City,” Dean said, words muffled by the other half of the Twinkie. “Duh.”
~
“Ianto always has what you need.”
“What if I needed a space ship?” “What type?” Ianto asks. “Well, I suppose—” The Doctor slammed to a verbal halt and stared. “What do you mean, what type?” “Personal, scout, cruise liner, hospital, dreadnought, planet-killer, ark—”
~
“I don’t know,” Yunel says, his favourite English phrase. “Sometimes, when you’re sleeping. You say things about fire.” Calvin laughs self-consciously. He’s always nodding off on the couch while Yunel watches soccer games, and when he jerks awake Yunel is usually looking at him with concern. He’d always thought it was because Yunel pitied him for being unable to appreciate soccer.

“Swords?” Hardison’s eyebrows rose dramatically. “There are zombies crawling over a good chunk of the civilized world and your best plan is sharp knives with ambition?”
~ “It’s a British thing, right?” he asks, three days in while she’s manning the glorified TV table she calls a desk, rescheduling hearings and a half-dozen other appointments that come with the legacy of Harvey and the Commissioner’s grand plan to end organized crime in Gotham. “Because you’re starting to scare me with the efficiency.”
“No, it’s a survival mechanism,” Kara replies, not looking up from her computer. “Otherwise, the paperwork takes over the office, develops sentience, and eats the city in a sans serif induced homicidal rage.”
~ “Maybe your next great plan can break less laws,” she says, but she makes an error on her toning, and it sounds like I’m so proud of you to both of them. Henry smiles, his eyes crinkling in the way Emma knows her face crinkles in the rare occasion she smiles. I’m proud of you is okay if it slips out. The I love you that lingers underneath, real and painful, is much more dangerous. She swallows that down and looks stern.

“You put me up against the Vatican’s super secret, so-secret they don’t even exist black ops force without telling me, and I’m melodramatic?”
“Consider revenge served,” she says and clicks off, leaving me a lot of miles between here and the turn-off into nowhere to wonder how long she’s been nursing a grudge about the last time. It wasn’t my fault I had to leave in a rush. Sure, I could’ve told her, but I didn’t think she’d appreciate knowing she’d been harbouring a felon wanted in five countries in her bed. Seems like she’s figured it out.
~ The tentacles turned to look at Ianto. He attempted an appeasing smile. “Uh, hello.” The tentacles shot further out, wrapped themselves around his chest, waist and ankles and pulled him into the wall.
~
Meanwhile, Jack was looking angry and commanding, and completely unnerved. Rhys felt an enormous pang of sympathy for the man, who clearly just wanted something to shoot at and have done with it.

“I hated hating you. Scowling gives you wrinkle lines and I am way too young for Botox.”
~ “It looks like a refugee camp,” Josh told him flatly, staring at the rows of tents of people waiting to buy tickets.
“Krzyzewskiville is a hallowed tradition of Tobacco Road and this is a character building exercise indigenous to the students of this great university,” the senator told him easily, peering at him over a stack of annotated pages.
“Does character-building in the South always include contracting consumption?” Josh asked, too-innocently.
~
“Okay, see, they make these things supposedly so that kids can’t get them but—” Josh muttered under his breath, struggling with the child-proof cap on the Tylenol.
“For God’s sake,” Intern Aggie muttered, snatching away the bottle.   
“Stop that,” Josh snapped at her, pulling the bottle back. Shaking the bottle in fury, he yelled, “Okay, God damn it! I am an adult and I am a political consultant and my law degree says I should be able to open this as well as write a contract!” She took the bottle back and pulled the top off, handing it to him wordlessly. Josh pointed down the steps. “Go away from here.”
~ “What are you doing?” Sam asked, blue eyes blurry with fever, curling into himself underneath the blanket.
Josh blinked at him. “I’m—I’m giving you Tylenol.” He held out the pills.
“I need Tylenol,” Sam said uncertainly.
“You have a fever,” Josh told him. “I have no idea how high, but your skin is uncomfortably hot and also you’ve been mumbling about First Amendment law and fair use so I assume you have a fever.”
“Then I need some acetaminophen,” Sam said, frowning.
“Then it’s very lucky that I have Tylenol,” Josh said, folding the pills into Sam’s hands, holding out the plastic mug. “Careful.”
Sam stared at him groggily. “Where are we?” he asked, pushing himself up onto his elbows and putting the Tylenol in his mouth, reaching blindly for the mug.  ”Ow,” he said, when he took a sip, swallowing the tablets painfully. “This is really hot.”
“Yes,” Josh agreed, leaning back on his heels and feeling his knees ache. “That’s why I said you should be careful.”
“Then that was good advice,” Sam mumbled, looking blearily around. “Where am I?”
~
“I tried polite,” she said defensively. “He was too dumb to get it.” Donna narrowed her eyes and took a dramatic, shuddering breath. “I don’t have to prostitute myself for this firm—” “Nah,” Mike said easily, to forestall the performance. “Even if you were, you’d be too expensive for Pearson Hardman to afford, anyway.”
~ She tended to be sarcastic at Harvey when he tried to protect Donna (the words “paternalistic ass” may have been used), but she did her part, just as subtly, to keep Donna out of harm’s way.
~ “Donna is very allergic,” Louis lied snottily. Donna obligingly fell into a coughing fit. “And you’ve probably got pollen or other flower…accoutrements all over yourself. You’ll need to go.”
~ “So,” she said, after a moment. “That was unexpected.”  “New York public school system,” Mike explained. “You go in there with my IQ, you come out with a mean right hook.”
~
She answers the door to find two uniformed young men three steps down her stoop. They are out of place against the backdrop of her quiet street and they wear small American flags on their shoulders. They look polite in the practiced sort of way that can only come through training and years of doing unpleasant things.
~ “Check me on this,” he asked Lupin. “Rabbits give birth, right? They don’t spontaneously divide.” “Normal mammals,” Lupin confirmed.
~ While he was over at the bar, he came up with a plan: 1.) Finish the job 2.) Get the money 3.) Shoot “Captain” Jack Harkness. Preferably after breaking at least one if not both of his grabby hands. It was a simple plan, but those were the kind Jayne had always liked best.

“Fun? What exactly is your definition of fun?”
“Um…James will be there?” 
“I think you and the OED need to have a chat about your definitions.”

“Well, I think she’s thoroughly disgusted by you.”
“Challenge accepted.”

“But I specifically told you not to follow.”
“She said farrow,” Shawn informed Gus. 
“Farrow is not a word. I said follow. He knows I said follow,” she said.
“I wasn’t there,” Gus said, “but farrow is most definitely a word. It means to birth a calf or a litter of pigs.” 
“Okay, fine. Why would I ask Shawn not to birth a calf or a litter of pigs?”
“Please tell me why they’re at my crime scene,” Lassiter barked at them. 
“Lassie, it’s not Juliet’s fault. She told me not to follow her and I thought she was telling me not to be pregnant with swine.”

“Oh god, he’s here early. How do I look?”
“It’s better if you don’t know.”

“He says he’s going to commune with some earth deity to find out what we need. Naked, apparently.”
“That is not something I want to see.” Too late, the image appeared in his head. “Oh God, I’m seeing it. Oh God.”

“Don’t do anything stupid.”
“Well, I was going to, but now that you mention it…”
~
“Stop reading, dude. Only robots process that much information.”
“Bite me.”
“Nuh-uh, I’m not explaining that to your sister again.”
~
“You’re damn right you’ll keep in touch. You Winchesters can only walk so far before you step in some serious shit.”
~ Sam’s eyes flicked back to the door again before he made his decision. “Listen, there’s something I have to tell you.”
When he wasn’t really forthcoming in with what that something was, Alt.Dean followed Sam’s gaze to the door, and then swept the room. His mouth formed a small ‘O’. “Oh. Is she hot?”
“Who?” It took him a minute to realise the implications of waiting for someone in a motel like the one he was in. Thing was, that conclusion was so far from the truth that he spluttered, “Oh, no – God no!”
Alt. Dean blinked. “Just so we’re clear, I was giving you the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was a woman.”
“What? No, it’s complicated.” How the hell was he going to explain this? It was a Monty Python skit waiting to happen.
Alt. Dean however, was hearing an entirely different conversation. “Oh God, is it a man?”
“Dean!”
Alt. Dean raised his hands. “Not that I’m judging. It’s your life—”
“Dean, just shut up a minute and let me explain.” Sam interrupted, trying to gather his thoughts.
“You don’t have to explain anything, Sam.”
“It’s you, you idiot!”
Alt. Dean froze. His mouth opened and closed a few times before it scrunched up in confusion. “...What?”
Sam held up his hands as if to calm him. “Look, I can explain everything, just put down the gun down.” Alt. Dean didn’t remember drawing his weapon. A quick glance at his side-holster confirmed it. He was about to ask Sam how much he’d smoked before he had shown up when he noticed that Sam wasn’t even looking at him. When he heard the click of a safety disengaging behind him, he knew why. Slowly he raised his hands and turned around.
Holding a gun to his head was someone he never expected to see. And for good reason. “Hey, no offence – but aren’t you supposed to be dead?” Maybe this isn’t the reality I thought it was. Awkwarrrrd.
His doppelganger ignored him. “Sam?”
Sam started edging closer, as though to protect Dean from... well, Dean. “Dean, don’t shoot him. He’s you.”
He kept the gun trained on his double. “No, see of all the people in this room that would enter the Me Pageant, I think I’d win.” Sam sent him a look and Dean got the message, putting his gun away. Sam could tell he was still agitated though, so he took a breath. “When you died...”
“You cloned me.” Dean stared at his twin in realisation. “You went all Sixth Day on my ass.”
Sam looked to the other Dean for help, but he seemed quite content in just watching. Sam should’ve known better. “Dude, you do realise how crazy that sounds, right? He’s from another reality.” At Sam’s apparent recognition and explanation, Alt. Dean internally sighed that he had been right the first time. He was in the right reality.
“Another reality?” Dean echoed. He held up a hand, “Clone.” And then the other, “Alternate Reality.” He weighed them for a second before turning to Sam. “Who’s crazy?”

“Raffles are cool,” Harry said defensively.
“As long as you define cool as ‘the lack of anything remotely resembling style and class’, maybe.”
“Why is he here?” Hermione asked Harry reproachfully.
“Because the other option was leaving him alone with all my stuff in my rooms.”
~
“How much? And why do these things always need my blood?”
“You’re the last living descendent that we know of for certain,” Hermione said. “And even if we’re fairly sure about Alex, I’m hardly going to go up to a first year student and stab him with my fork or something. I’ll need about an eggcup full. It acts as ink.”
“The more I hear about it, the more fun this spell sounds.”
“I know a spell for drawing blood fairly painlessly,” Draco offered.
Harry made a face. “Of course you do.”
~
“I thought you said this was supposed to be painless,” Harry said through gritted teeth as the inkpot filled magically with his blood.
Draco shrugged, looking supremely unconcerned. “It’s a borrowed wand. And I’m a bit rusty. Ergh – I hate blood. Especially Gryffindor blood. I swear it’s—you know—redder and bloodier than other blood.”
“Can we silence him?” Harry appealed to Hermione.
“I don’t know why you haven’t done it already,” she replied distractedly, straightening the parchment on the table in front of her. “Anyone else would have.”
Draco straightened indignantly. “What does it take for people to show me any respect around here? I don’t know! I agree to help you out of the goodness of my heart—”
“Because we sprung you from prison and threatened you, actually,” Harry reminded him.
“—the goodness of my heart,” Draco continued loudly, “and what do I get in return? Ridicule and derision, that’s what. No one appreciates the hard work I—”
“Silencio,” Hermione said. “Honestly, Harry. Is he like this all the time?”
~ “The apartment is nicer than I thought it’d be,” he said, apropos of nothing. “Mycroft made it sound like a health hazard.” “Mycroft did visit shortly after a major bombing,” Sherlock said, testy and oddly defensive.
~
“What’s he studying?” Sherlock made a vague gesture. “Computer science. Possibly maths. He started out with engineering but that only lasted until Mycroft caught him building a nuclear reactor in the attic.” John froze in place and blinked. “Where the hell did he get the fuel for a nuclear reactor?”
“Certain types of antique pottery glazes contain detectable amounts of uranium,” Sherlock said, like it was be common knowledge. “Look, this is all irrelevant. If he’s so bound up about his bloody courses he should just quit and be done with it. He wouldn’t be the first person to make a fortune in computer science without a degree. Just look at...you know, that man. The one with the jumpers.”
“Bill Gates?” John hazarded. “Maybe. Irrelevant.” Sherlock continued pacing.
~ “I teach him necessary life skills,” Sherlock said. “You taught me how to make mustard gas from cleaning products,” Ford muttered. Mycroft blinked. “Is that what happened to the budgerigar?”
~ Cam had looked almost offended. “Christmas doesn’t suck. Christmas is the best time of the year.”
~ “Have you slept? No, fuck that, you haven’t. Have you eaten? Today,” he adds when Cam opens his mouth. Cam frowns, looks around the living room, and finally meets his eyes sheepishly. “I’m not sure what today is,” he admits
~
“Arthur,” said Eames, slapping him on the back with a little more force than was surely necessary, “I must thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for choosing a restaurant so delightfully inaccessible to those with cars. Truly, the effort of finding one so distant from any car parks must have been magnificent. Bravo.”
~
“Do I smell like sausage?” Harvey gave him a baffled look. “No more than usual.” ~ “Did you sleep here last night?” “Well, I wouldn’t call it sleeping.” ~ “Do I look dashing?” “No one says dashing.” ~ “Give me the keys.” “Do I have to say no to that or should I just assume it’s a rhetorical question.” ~

“I like your stuffed unicorn,” she commented.
“His name is Kraven the Destroyer,” Puck corrected, before remembering he was angry at her.
~ “I’m not suggesting that we kill him,” the gorilla said, which would have been comforting except for the tinge of regret in his tone. “But we could avoid a lot of unnecessary damage if we just confine him for a while. Until we can be sure he’s in his right mind. Test his memories and all that.”
~ Arthur is leaning over Ariadne’s model, listening to her explanations, when his laptop lets out a muted “boodle-beep!” Eames puts down his folder and watches Arthur check his email. That’s the only reason he doesn’t drop something (the way Ariadne does) when Arthur shouts, “FUCK!” Arthur follows that up by dropping into his seat, muttering obscenities into his hands. Eames looks at Ariadne. Ariadne looks at Eames. Eames tips his head in Arthur’s direction. Ariadne nods, encouragingly. Eames shakes his head and points at her. Ariadne shakes her head and points back. Eames looks at Arthur, who has progressed to some very determined typing, but is still muttering under his breath. Eames looks back at Ariadne and attempts to silently convey the message, ‘Do I look like a fucking idiot?’ Ariadne looks confused. One of them really ought to ask. One of them really ought to go over there and quietly ask what’s happened to upset Arthur and if they can do anything to help. Failing that, a paper ball to the head and a raised eyebrow would probably do, but even that much risks transferring Arthur’s ire from persons unknown to persons present. And Eames can totally hold out longer than Ariadne can.
~ “Embarrassing stories, huh? He ever mention the time he tried out for the cheerleading team?” “It was the gymnastics squad, and if you tell that story I’ll make you sleep in your car,” Sam says from behind him.
~
“Dude. Stop staring at her ass,” says Sam. “Have you seen her ass?” “Yes, actually.”
“Then you know why I’m staring at it.” Jess grins and pretends she can’t hear them, though they’re only a few steps behind her. “She doesn’t happen to have any naughty schoolgirl outfits, does she?” Dean asks. Jess looks over at her shoulder at him and grins. “Dude,” says Dean, looking at Sam. “You’re, like, the luckiest man alive.”
~ “And you say I muck up diplomatic negotiations, Ed,” the High King of Narnia said. He didn’t even turn around. Edmund dropped into a chair. “I have got to stop trying to sneak up on you,” he said. “It’s not doing much for my self-esteem at all.”

“You could play golf,” Dan says.  “I’m black, Danny.” “Tiger Woods is black.” “But I am also cool.” “Are you saying Tiger Woods isn’t cool, Isaac?” Dana asks, surprised. “No one who owns that many polo shirts is cool.”
~
“That’s my briefcase. And that was locked,” he says.  Winchester doesn’t even look up from rifling through the briefcase. “Yep.”
~
“Now give me that. I need to shoot an owl.” He wiggled his fingertips in a beckoning motion, straight-backed and imperious against the hallway light, evidently expecting John to get up out of his nice warm bed, cross the room and hand him the gun. John had apparently developed a Pavlovian response to that particular tone of voice, damn it, because he was half-way out of bed and preparing to deliver a loaded weapon like it was a bloody pizza before his brain caught up with his actions.
“Hang on a – no – what?” John said, shaking his head and pulling the gun primly back into his lap. “An owl?”
Sherlock made a frustrated noise, his shoulders vibrating. “Yes, yes, a medium-sized barn owl. Yes. Now hand over the blasted gun, so I can blow its tiny little brains out.” John replayed the conversation in his head again. It still didn’t make sense. 
“I’m not helping you to shoot an endangered species, Sherlock,” he said, firmly.
~
“So,” said John, feeling out of his depth once again. “An owl.” It was the same mild, politely curious tone of voice with which he had previously found himself uttering such things as: “So – three bags of frozen AB negative,” and “So – a selection of human ears.”
~ “You didn’t think about sleep as an option, when you were bored at half past three in the morning?” he asked.
Sherlock frowned. “No,” he said, as though John had just said something exceptionally stupid. 
~ John sighed. “I’m going to make a cup of tea,” he said at last. “Assuming there’s nothing unseemly lurking in the kettle. Is there anything unseemly lurking in the kettle?”
“No,” said Sherlock, as though this were a completely ridiculous question.
“Good. Right – well, tea, then.”
John was half way into the kitchen when Sherlock muttered, crossly: “Don’t look in the microwave.”
~ “And I haven’t opened it because quite obviously it’s a wedding invitation, and I have no interest in weddings. Weddings represent the triumph of conformity over individuality, of dumb optimism over sanity and experience, of plebeian desire over self control. Moreover they throw you together with a host of desperately dull and often inebriated persons who are labouring under the misapprehension that they know you, when really all they know is that you once vomited all over the Christmas pudding, and tried experimental taxidermy on your grandmother’s favourite pug.”
John allowed a moment to pass after this torrent of words, before saying in a very level voice: “I trust the pug was already dead?”
“Well of course it was,” Sherlock retorted, looking affronted.
~ “You must be John Watson,” she said as she stepped off the hearth, smiling at him in the mild and beatific manner of somebody who has taken an awful lot of drugs, or read a great many self help books.
~ “She was asleep,” says Uhura, after a long pause in which Jim rather suspects she has considered a whole range of more colourful responses. “She was fast asleep when we left.”
“I woke up, Mama,” says Amanda quickly. “I had bad dreams, and they frightened me. When I woke up, I wanted you and Father, but you weren’t here.” Jim’s mouth does not fall open at this calm little sequence of lies, but his admiration for his goddaughter increases by the moment. “Captain Kirk offered me hot milk and told me traditional children’s folk tales of his people, but I was still sad. And I wanted to be sure that this vessel was completely safe, so the Captain agreed to show me around, to put my mind at ease.” There is a thoughtful pause, while Jim tries to look like a virtuous man whose honour has been impugned, and not a reprobate godfather who has just taught a sweet, five-year-old genius (who is arguably the most famous member of the Vulcan aristocracy) to swear and play poker. And, apparently, lie like a champion.
~ Neville groaned. “How does she even get internet here?”
“It’s Hermione,” Ron said, as if that explained everything. Harry, who had known Hermione since they were both eleven, nodded understandingly.
“Can someone turn her brain off?” Draco said from his sprawled position on the sofa. “I swear I can smell burning.”
~ Ron flicked his wand and Draco gave a horrified hiccough which resulted in a slug.
“I knew I would perfect that hex someday,” Ron said with great satisfaction.
“You’re a – hic – uncultured barbarian, Weasley.”
“Yeah? I’m not the one who just blew a green slug out of his left nostril.”
 ~ “Besides, I don’t even have a tux,” he objected before realizing his mistake. Neal’s manic glow of before was nothing compared to the way his face lit up at the thought of shopping for formal wear.
~
Lestrade glances over at Sherlock, and flinches. John’s flatmate is thoughtfully rubbing together his now blood-covered fingers, staring at his hand with narrow-eyed focus. “Deducing time of accident based on coagulation rate,” John tells Lestrade pleasantly.
“Then take me to the display,” Sherlock says. Standing, he casually wipes his bloody hand off on the shoulder of Anderson’s blue crime-scene coveralls. Anderson gapes, momentarily stunned into silence. John tries not to snicker. Beside him, Lestrade makes a noise that could have been strangled laughter as easily as it could have been a strangled protest. “I need to see where the sword came from,” Sherlock says, ignoring them all.
~
“Clear to anyone with half a brain,” says Sherlock, absently. “So, probably just me, yes. Don’t you need to pack?” “Pack?” John repeats, blankly. Sherlock makes an impatient noise. “Pack. For Paris.” John considers saying something about jurisdictional lines. Then John considers the odds that Sherlock is going to let something like the law keep him away from the mysterious not-as-dead-as-she-ought-to-be thief. Then, with a sigh, John stands and heads to his room to pack.
~
“I was mugged.”
“So you gave them my phone?”
“I wasn’t going to give them mine!”
Mike blinks, and then he actually processes the conversation. “Wait. You were mugged? Are you alright?”
~ “Why were you trying to return my phone at-” he pauses to check his watch - “two in the morning?”
“Because you left it in my office.”
“I was objecting to the ‘two in the morning’ part,” Mike says. Then he frowns. “Then again, why would you ever return my phone?”
~
Mike goes to enter, but one look from Donna stops him in his tracks. “I-I’ll be back later,” Mike stammers. “Maybe.” Donna keeps glaring. “You know what? Harvey knows where I am. He can just come find me when he needs to.” Mike scurries off towards the bullpen, not sparing a second glance inside Harvey’s office.
~ “This couldn’t have waited until morning,” she asks, eyeing the clock. “It’s only three hours away.”
~ “Do I want to know what you’re using this for?” Jones asked, that afternoon, handing Neal a bullet-proof vest.
“Personal protection,” Neal said. “I feel very unsafe after the shooting.”
Jones caught his eye. Neal looked unrepentant.
“Don’t do anything that’ll get you locked up,” he said.
“I won’t get caught,” Neal assured him. Diana crossed her arms.
“Are you going to kill him?” she asked bluntly.
“What would be the fun in that?”
~
“He shot Mrs. Suit? I’ll need fifty grand for the hit,” Mozzie said. “Seventy to make it look like an accident. Your share is half, I got the rest. I know this guy—”
“Nah, this is a do-it-yourself gig,” Neal replied.
Mozzie broke into a wide grin. “The full treatment?”
~
“Cranky,” Peter answered, but he sounded more cheerful. “She hates daytime television.”
“I hear there are these new things called DVDs, you put them in the TV and they make movies happen,” Neal replied.

Everyone knew the rift took things. It liked Tosh’s sandwiches, Gwen’s brand of mascara and, Jack claimed, his underwear, though people seemed inexplicably sceptical whenever he used that excuse. It was the rift that removed any and all yellow highlighters from the building with a thoroughness that bordered on the fetishistic and replaced them with small piles of pungent, purple fruit. Jack was quite relieved when they worked that out. The idea that he’d been on one planet, in one job long enough to be drafting Do Not Fuck With The Stationery Cupboard memos? Terrifying. The fact that he’d half-considered three ways to explain this in the Torchwood One annual budget meeting – hell, that he’d half-considered attending the Torchwood One annual budget meeting? Shoot him. Shoot him now. Well, no. He didn’t mean that. It wouldn’t accomplish anything, and he’d wake up to Ianto’s paperwork face.
~ “That was…” Jack waves a hand in front of his face as if that will somehow communicate the intricacies of interstellar travel directly into Merlin’s brain. “Your neck,” he says eventually, in the tone of a man who has stumbled past drunkenness and is now clinging doggedly to a sublime truth, “is really good.” Merlin nods, slowly, as if understanding this for the first time. “Your coat,” he tells Jack, “is on fire.”

Half an hour later, and Leonard was kneeling on the couch, his forearms resting on the back, as he watched the Doctor and Sheldon arguing and gesticulating like a pair of lunatics, occasionally pausing to swipe the eraser and/or the dry-erase pen from one another. 
~ His vision starts to clear first, colour blossoming into the black in painful increments. He’s leaning against something, probably Harvey. He blinks rapidly, trying to force his eyes to refocus and realizes he’s staring at Harvey’s face at a new angle. “Are you actually holding me up?” he asks. It comes out slurred, potentially too muddled to understand. Harvey doesn’t answer even if he does understand the question, just looks down with his face set in disapproving, almost angry lines. Mike decides he doesn’t want to deal with a pissy Harvey after taking a reinforced left hook for him and closes his eyes and focuses on breathing.
~
“I have a look,” Harvey says, the same words but shaped with a heavy scepticism not present in Mike’s statement.  “I don’t know,” Mike mutters quickly, more insistently, thinking ‘shut up, shut up’. “Whatever.”
~ “What sort of general thing are we doing on Tuesday? Is it fancy?”
“Are you trying to ask me what you should wear?” Harvey asked.
“Of course I’m not asking you what I should wear. You wear three piece suits all the time. You have unrealistic expectations.”
~ If he had a blanket, he’d be pulling it up around his chest looking scandalized. That is literally the only word for his expression: scandalized.
~
Jack shrugged. “I’m not really bleeding anymore.” She still looked sceptical. Apparently that wasn’t as reassuring as he intended.
~
Jessica is starting to think they’ve forgotten she’s even there when Mike says, “I’m sorry, would you excuse us a moment,” as he grips Harvey’s arm with hand and Harvey’s tie with the other, hauling him up and dragging him to a corner of the room over Harvey’s vehement protests that “is not a proper way to handle silk damn it!”.  “Oh, no. Don’t mind me,” she mutters, “it’s just my damn office.”
~
“You’re an idiot,” Harvey tells Mike.  In response, Mike leans around the paramedic taking his blood pressure, upper body hanging over the railing of the stretcher precariously in a way that concerns everyone but the relevant party. “Not the time, Harvey.” “Well, I can’t very well berate you after the surgery. That’d be cruel.” “Oh my God, would you stop talking,” Mike moans. One of the paramedics has had the insight to pin his shoulders, but that still leaves his hands free to gesture for emphasis. “Are you…sure you want him to ride along?” asks the younger of the two paramedics, glancing from Harvey to Mike with a look of growing apprehension. “Yes,” they reply in unison.  Mike’s a little slow in the uptake – maybe something to do with an attack of acute appendicitis, who knows – so Harvey gets first shot at explaining. “He’s already proven he can’t make rational medical decisions for himself,” Harvey says, index finger pointed at Mike warningly. In response, Mike waves his hands in some complicated motion that is halfway between ‘he’s going to talk his way into coming anyways’ and ‘I want him there’.
~ Mike counts backwards from ten arithmetically and upwards to infinity geometrically and he lets the anaesthesia address the mathematical impossibilities.
~
“It’s Mal,” he says blankly. “She’s in labour. It’s too early.” 
Well, that’s clear as mud. More information is required. “Where is she now?” asks Arthur, going to his computer.
“On the way to hospital.”
“In what country?” Arthur asks patiently. Cobb seems to come awake. “Paris.”
“Do you care about getting there legally?”
“Do I look like I care?” Cobb says sharply. “As long as I don’t get arrested on my way into the hospital.”
~
“If you touch him,” Arthur says quietly, and then doesn’t finish the sentence. It’s creepy and effective, which is about par for the course for Arthur, who clearly thinks of himself as a precise, steady, reliable and moderate person but comes off like a cyborg raised by feral cats: disquieting, dangerous, occasionally stupidly loyal. It’s one of Eames’ absolute favourite things about him.
~
“Frankly, I’m surprised you want to eat at all,” Dr. Ronson says, musing. “You might be feeling a little nau—” Eames chooses this moment to lean over and throw up all over Arthur’s shoes.”—seated,” the doctor concludes, faltering.
~
“Because I am a lawyer, Mike, not a debutante.”
“You’d look very pretty in the fluffy white dress,” Mike said, with a weird sort of loyalty, like he had no doubt in Harvey’s ability to pull anything off with style.
~
“You really think Doyle and Nelson can’t handle it? Those boys are carrying more armament than a combat helicopter.”
~ Dr. Jones takes his reaction remarkably well. In fact, she’s taken all of his reactions remarkably well, including John’s insistence that he’s from, well, the future. She has a sort of air of unflappable calm about her, as if she’s seen shit that’s way crazier than anything John could say or do. John is envious of that calm; he’s feeling pretty flapped, himself.
~ “I’m Mike,” Mike says, “And you are sitting in the middle of Park Avenue without a collar so either you’re lost or some asshole left you on the curb.”
‘Or I’m a high-powered lawyer who was recently transfigured into a kitten by a disgruntled witch-client,’ Harvey thinks, but he doesn’t hold it against Mike for not including that in his list of options.
~
“Giant rats?” Mickey asked. “Really?”
“You had to be there. They were terrifying at first, and then just horrible in a very dull way.”
~
“I—” Eliot cast around, but knew he’d already lost. “I am wearing tights,” he huffed, gesturing at the clothes they’d borrowed from the pirates in order to blend in. “Tight tights,” came Hardison’s snicker, which was ignored.
~
Dean put his hands on his hips. ”You’re kidding.” He looked down. The cat tipped its head back and looked up. “Sam, is that you?” There was a moment, and then the cat nodded slowly, up and down. A clear gesture. “Sam, you cut that out right now.  It’s not funny.”
~ “I don’t have any of your money,” said Dean brightly.  “I have my money, which I won off you fair and square.”
~
Sam looked down at himself, mournful.  “I’m gonna miss running naked all over the place. It was very freeing.”  He stood up, wobbled uncertainly and dug through his bag for a pair of jeans.  “On the other hand – pockets.”
~
“My dad’s a brain doctor.” “Woah,” Dean says, duly impressed.  “What’s his name?” “Fred.”
“What’s his last name?” Callie opens her mouth to answer and Dean cheers inwardly, but then her eyebrows shoot together and she eyes him suspiciously.  “I’m not telling.  ‘Cause you’re gonna call him and he’ll come get me and I am running away.” Dammit.  Dean can’t figure out if six year-olds are normally this quick. 
~ Dean looks down at his wrist, immobilized in a stained beige splint, and he tries to think of a more childproof explanation than ‘A poltergeist threw me through a window.’ “I fell out of a tree,” is what he comes up with. Callie nods understandingly, busy buckling herself in.  “That was dumb.”
~
“I like cupcakes,” Callie says finally, and Dean thinks maybe that means he won.
~
When she tells him, Dean nearly dislocates his shoulder again trying not to laugh. “Callie O’Malley,” he repeats, wheezing a little. “I know,” she says, with long-suffering patience.  “It rhymes.”  Dean gets himself under control and calls the directory, asks for Fred O’Malley and then waits nervously as the phone rings, heart kicking up a butterfly beat against his ribs. It rings twice and then someone snatches it up, a breathless male voice answers, “Hello?” Dean passes the phone quickly to Callie. “Hi, Daddy, I ran away,” she says, and the other end of the phone explodes.
‘Caroline O’Malley you tell me where you are right this instant Jesus Christ I was out of my mind where the hell are you Callie I’m not mad but where the hell are you.’ “I’m with Dean,” Callie says after a moment, despite Dean’s frantic head-shaking, and then there’s another surge of noise. “He’s not a crazy person, he’s a good guy, and he’s taking me home right now.” Dean groans and starts the car, listens as Callie tries to soothe her father.  It would be kind of funny, actually, how unhinged Fred is compared to the unruffled patience of his daughter, would be funny if it weren’t for how acutely Dean feels his fear, and his relief. Finally Callie hangs up the phone and puts it down on the dashboard. “He’s mad,” she says, gnawing her lower lip.  “Maybe we should eat more waffles.”
~
Something hits him in the face. It’s someone’s panties, and Sam can’t just throw those back, that would be rude, so he stuffs them in his pocket as the audience screams approval.
~
“We took Understanding the Multicultural World together,” Uhura reminds him. “You did a fifteen-minute presentation on stereotypes and misrepresentations of the East.” “It was a good presentation,” says Hikaru defensively. “It was,” Uhura agrees. “Which is why I’m wondering why you’re writing your novel about ninjas.”
~
The second time Louis comes by to ask her to be his assistant, she just fakes cramps and describes the pain in detail until he excuses himself in a strangled voice and shuffle-runs back to his office.
~
“I’m just jealous. I can’t get drunk.” Steve shrugs. “No matter how much I drink.”
Nate reluctantly lifts his eyes. “That sounds like a challenge,” he says, experimentally.
“I am not facilitating your alcoholism,” Steve says, after a pause. 
~
Tony squints at Nate. “I’m a multi-billionaire,” he says, eventually.
“Do you often win arguments with that statement?”
~
“A warrior’s smell,” Thor bellows, clapping Eliot on the back like he thinks it’s him. “You and I must eat a whole cow to bond as warriors.”
~
“Okay,” he says, “So now that both you assholes know, and considering you’ve both done the proposal thing successfully, give me some good advice. I mean, first of all, am I supposed to ask her dad’s permission?” Esposito wonders. “And before you answer that, I just want you to know that her dad is a scary-ass ex-Army colonel who told me over Thanksgiving dinner that if I broke his daughter’s heart, Homicide would have one more cold case because they’d never find my body.” “Definitely ask,” Castle and Thornton say simultaneously.
~
“Do you understand I will turn you into something unpleasant if you do not go to sleep?”
“Yes!” And to be fair, he probably did.
~
“I didn’t like his last partner.”
“That’s because you need to stop judging people by their facial hair.”
“There was no excuse for those sideburns. None.” 
~
“It’s not as though she’s going to believe we’re together,” she says. “She’s been to our flat.” “Everybody thinks we’re shagging,” Arthur counters.  “No, you just think everyone thinks we’re shagging.”
~
“I always knew you were gay. You shag like a gay man,” Sophia declares, which takes Arthur aback. 
“Exactly how many gay men have you shagged?” Merlin asks, wrapping an arm around Arthur’s waist and peeking over his shoulder.  “And you,” she sputters, pointing at Merlin. “You probably made him gay in the first place!” Just behind Sophia, several other people seem entirely too interested in the turn this conversation has taken. Or possibly they’re just waiting to get on the train.  “Yes, I’m a magical gay sorcerer,” Merlin snorts. “I use my magic to make men gay, and we must go before you taint us with your warped heterosexuality.”
~ “You’re the mayor’s disgraceful son. Shouldn’t you be off doing something inappropriate for the gossip magazines?” “The hookers and cocaine are arriving at six,” Arthur assures her, and is pleased when the corner of her mouth rises, just a little.
~ “Ah—as you can see by their rich and exotic attire, they come from a far land of ice and mists, one I had to travel many leagues, and surpass many obstacles to discover…” “But you’ve only been gone since yesterday afternoon, Kay.”
~ “Here she is,” Dean beamed, running a caressing hand down the metal, as if he were introducing them to the finest Arabian charger in the kingdom. He looked at them expectantly, clearly waiting for an admiring response. Arthur and Merlin exchanged a surreptitious glance. “She’s lovely,” Arthur ventured, in the tone that had always worked on the homely wives of minor lords. He mustered up a smile, and elbowed Merlin, who thus prodded chimed in with “yeah, gorgeous.” Dean seemed satisfied.
~ “You do know I’m Jewish, right? I’ve been guilted by professionals. You can’t guilt me,” and the President narrowed his eyes and Josh quickly amended, “—unless you want to, and then, yes, yes, you can.”
~
John was unsurprised to see Sherlock grinning to himself. “You enjoy causing him emotional discomfort far too much.”
“No,” said Sherlock, picking up the pace as they rounded the corner into Baker Street, “I enjoy it exactly as much as I should.”
~
“You were fucking shot in the thigh. You complete arse.”
“Thanks for coming so quickly.”
“You could have bled to death in minutes,” John hissed. “It was,” he held up his fingers a centimetre apart, in front of Sherlock’s nose, “this close to nicking your femoral artery.”
“I appreciate both your concern and your abuse of medical privilege to be here, I want that known,” Sherlock rasped.
~
“I’m always acting in self-defence. Sometimes, it’s pre-emptive self-defence.”
~
Rowan laughed, and it wasn’t a pleasant sound. “Who could possibly discover us here?” Harry figured that was as good a time as any to start wordlessly stunning them.
~
They crouched behind the crates, trying desperately to stay quiet. “What you may not have heard, was that our plans were foiled by Harry Potter,” was what they overheard. Both Sam and Dean turned to look at Harry, who didn’t turn to look back at them.
~
Kingsley came rushing up a minute later, closely followed by Percy. The Minister stopped and surveyed the scene in front of him - Harry surrounded by eight stunned death eaters - and shook his head. He didn’t even look surprised, this time. “Someday, Harry,” he said tiredly, “you’re going to learn the meaning of the words ‘time off’.”
~ The Dragon blinked. “The Wheel of Destiny spins not for the fanciful whims of men,” it intoned. “What does that even mean?” Merlin mumbled around his mouthful of bread. “The Hands of Fate land where they may,” it replied just as solemnly, “You and Arthur are intertwined in every—” Merlin made a face. “Can we please never use ‘Arthur’ and ‘intertwined’ in the same sentence?”
~ For all its talk about Merlin and his Destiny, the Dragon seemed to be bored rather easily when Merlin expressed alarm about the process. “Every action is a road-mark in the journey upon which you both shall embark,” the Dragon said. It hadn’t even bothered to fly out to perch in its customary place across from Merlin; its voice was, consequently, echoing strangely through the cave. Merlin looked around, and tried to project his reply in a reasonable direction. “So I’m supposed to just be expected to come up with all kinds of excuses for why Arthur keeps—” Merlin cut himself off, and waved a hand “—why odd things keep happening?” “The World is often Strange and Unfathomable,” it said, finally crawling out from a pillar to lie lazily on a slab of rock.  “No,” Merlin snapped, patience at an end, “that’s just you. And stop capitalizing words to make them important,” he added meanly. “Patience is the Teacher for the Student to whom Life is the Subject,” the Dragon answered, completely unmoved. Merlin wondered if it just lounged around all day thinking of ridiculous and cryptic answers to all of Merlin’s questions.
~
There was an expectant silence, before it became obvious that the Dragon wasn’t going to offer anything else. “...Huh,” said Arthur, in the tones of a person who had been raised to feign understanding in the presence of polite company. And then he whispered to Merlin, “What does that even mean?”
~ “That’s what the Dragon was talking about? Arthur and I are soul-bonded?” That was the stupidest thing he’d ever heard, and he said so. Then, just for the record, he added, “I could do much better.” His father levelled him a look that suggested he’d had more intelligent conversations with trout. “Well you are. More or less. Until you regain your senses and break the bond.” “Gaius said breaking a soul-bond was fatal.” “A proper soul-bond, yes. Fortunately for you, not only are you a startlingly incompetent sorcerer, but you were attempting the impossible. You cannot truly bind an immortal soul to a mortal one.”  That took a moment to register. Merlin gaped. “Arthur’s immortal?” His father’s eyes narrowed. More intelligent conversations with pond scum, his eyebrows said. “No, you idiot child. You are.” “No,” Merlin said, because he was fairly certain that was the sort of thing he would know, “I’m not.”
~
His eyes narrowed in sudden realisation, and he straightened in his chair. “You convinced a dragon to make me a magical sword, but you couldn’t be arsed to heat my bathwater?”  “Couldn’t risk giving myself away,” Merlin corrected, and the best part was that it was true.  “Well,” Arthur frowned. “Good. That’s . . . surprisingly sensible of you.”
~
“But what if someone’s dying?”  “Promise me.” “I promise,” Merlin said. Then, because he’d never liked lying to Arthur, “Unless someone’s dying.”
~
“The soccer moms are still mad at you about the trail mix incident. Every kid was allergic to a different thing in that bag of death you brought home.”
~ “I overestimated my team’s focus...in that I thought they had any.”
~ “I’ll play your shoot-‘em-up video game. I have one issue though: I deplore violence. Is there a button on here for diplomacy?”
~
“Dad and Ben are arguing in the garage. They said I could have ice cream if I didn’t tell you the bad words they used. Chocolate, please!”
~ “I swear I told that guy 18 feet. Maybe he’s got that number disease where he heard—”
“There is no such disease, Kurt!”
~
“Well, there was Tina the stripper—I’m sorry, the exotic dancer—”
“No, Tina was a stripper.”
“—and the Burton twins—”
“They were twins? I thought I was just really drunk.”
~ “But I think I know how to fix it.”
“Good. How?”
“By coming to you so you can fix it.”
~
“Watching ‘Girl, Interrupted’ six times does not make you an expert on mental institutions.”
“No, but watching it seven times does. We Netflixed it again last night.”
~ “I’m in charge of pharmacology, so I’ll make sure that you only get sugar pills.”
“Sweet. Literally.”
~ “It’s still a chance to be part of something fantastic. It’s like—I may be sweeping up after elephants, but at least I’m still in the circus.”
~ “Hey can you give me a ride to the airport tomorrow?”
“Big canvas bags!”
“What?”
“Totes!”
~
“I don’t hate him, but let’s just say that if he was on fire and I had water, I’d drink it.”
~ “Yes, Mum. Now, what do you know about time travel?”
“A fair bit. Ripples and Alfred Pine and such.” At her daughter’s gape, she added, “I was top of my class, Nym. And close your mouth. Now, do we have visitors from the past or future?”
Dora looked at her father who shrugged. “I’ve been with her nearly thirty years and she still amazes me.”
~
“Let’s start with the basics: you don’t drink the holy water. Let me say that again: don’t drink the holy water. Bring something else to drink—preferably not water—so you don’t get confused. I prefer ginger ale, but there’s no wrong beverage to drink during an exorcism. Except holy water, OK? Unless there’s a demon in your bladder, you’re wasting a precious gift of God.”
~ Spock’s face flickered again. “Oh my God, you weren’t lonely,” Jim blurted out. “Was it someone I know? Was it a species I know? Iron, copper, or silicon-based blood?”
~
There’s an understanding in which Obadiah goes to meetings and handles the board while Tony invents missiles-within-missiles in between tinkering with hot rods and building himself new friends. Every once in a while Tony has to show up for a conference with the shareholders to assure them that he’s involved in the company and hasn’t died from alcohol poisoning, but the trade-off is that he gets to name Stark Industries’ next new shiny toy. That’s how they go from having an SMX-A-15 missile to the Panthenator in a single quarter.
~ He called to warn her that her date didn’t have so much as a parking ticket on his record and that it was obviously a red flag. “And you’re getting serial killer from that?” “Well, yeah. He’s clearly saving up for something big, Potts.”
~ When Will asked Peters for a dance studio, the CO handed Will a colour coded map of Atlantis, much like the map Rhodes had given him of Daedalaus and told him that red meant ‘Danger-Stay Out.’ Yellow meant ‘Science.’ Green meant ‘Military,’ blue was residential, orange were common rooms and purple were unclaimed. Will just had to find a purple room.
~ There was a gun pointed at his head. In general, Tony did not like this situation. To begin with, there was a gun, pointed at his head. To middle with, there was a gun pointed at his head by a gunnery sergeant who had flipped out over his pay-check and decided to hold a bank hostage without even robbing it first. To end with, there were about thirty other people in the bank. To postscript, gun and head.
~ “He is going to get everyone killed,” Ziva said.
“Right,” McGee said, “but I’m not saying that. What I’m saying is—any plan that turns on the fulcrum of Tony not annoying someone is probably a pretty flawed plan.” He put the binoculars up to his eyes again and watched Tony’s attempt at a hostage negotiation. It appeared to involve a disproportionate amount of gesturing.
~ McGee rolled his eyes. “Yes,” the woman said. “He said you’d do that.” She turned to Ziva. “Are you Officer David?” Ziva had apparently overheard enough of the conversation to know that she maybe didn’t want to be involved in it, but reluctantly said yes anyway. “He says to pay attention,” the woman said, “and watch how he doesn’t kill anyone.”
~
“Forgive him. He’s had three espressos.”
“Caffeine calms me,” he protested.
“It’s not working,” she told him.
~
“Of course, it’s ok for women to flirt to get what they want. I just wish I had something they wanted.”
~ “I think I’ll take myself out on a date tomorrow. But I’ll wear something slutty so that I don’t have to be interesting.”
~ “You told Lily?”
“No!...She was just there when I told Roxanne.”
~
“What? Seducing women is a numbers game. I strike out 90% of the time.”
“Thus restoring my faith in my gender,” she responded. 
~
“They’re using your runway to smuggle drugs. Are you stupid or a crook?”
“I don’t follow you.”
“Never mind. Got my answer.”
~
“Slight problem: they aren’t talking.”
“Did you ask them in a forceful tone that brooked no argument?”
~ “Come on, is evil magical power even something you can pass down through the generations? Is it like hair colour?”
~ Everything is just outlines and wave after wave of emotion; her senses are all off. She can hear the colors of the bathroom sink dripping and, when she tries to taste anything, it’s like the sound of her favorite wine glass shattering on the floor.
~
“Oh, I don’t think you’d do it deliberately, not really, but you know how the two of you are,” Annie says making a complicated and vaguely obscene gesture with her hands.
“What?” George asks, looking at her hands in horror.
“I can see you, the way the two of you are all over each other,” Annie explains.
“We are not!” George protests.
“We are?” Mitchell asks, looking at Annie curiously.
“All over each other,” Annie confirms, and then just to embarrass George. “It’s filthy.”
“You’re having me on,” George says, looking very worried. Mitchell laughs and then gives George a look that Annie can only describe as filthy. “And you, stop looking at me like that,” George orders Mitchell.
~
Annie puts down her book and looks at George lying haphazardly on the sofa with a huge grin on his face. “Did you bring him home drunk?” Annie demands of Mitchell, who has followed George into the room.
“He brought himself home,” Mitchell replies with a shrug. “I just followed.”
“Don’t think of your self as a ghost. It’s true that you are not strictly speaking alive,” George explains with the careful enunciation of someone who’s about eight hours away from being spectacularly hung over, “but I think you’re being a bit narrow-minded about it.”
“How can I be narrow-minded about being dead?” Annie asks and then turns to Mitchell and demands, “What was he drinking?”
“I told him it was a bad idea, but he just couldn’t say no to those drinks that come with the little umbrellas,” Mitchell laughs.
~ “So,” Jack called, stepping out of his office. “Who wants to kidnap a doctor?”
“We have to stop doing that,” Gwen said.
“Sooner or later the hospital’s going to notice,” Ianto agreed. Gwen shot him a look. “And of course it’s very wrong as well,” he added smoothly.
“Hey, as soon as we find one that doesn’t freak out when we show them the pterodactyl, I’ll stop retconning the ones we take,” Jack told him.
~
“Well, something’s wrong with him,” Jack said. “He tried to melt down the nuclear power plant outside Gotham yesterday.”
“Maybe he had a reason?”
“And I quote,” Ianto read from the newspaper, “Because humanity is a blight on the face of the Earth, beginning with that foul trap of pestilence and ugliness, Gotham.”
~
“Torchwood,” Batman said, because Batman didn’t really ask questions. He just repeated the bits of sentences that didn’t make sense.
~ “Do you like dogs?” James said hopefully. His eyes slid to Sirius, who glowered and shook his head. Undaunted, James turned back to Lily and went on, “I could Transfigure you some dogs. Our fire pokers make gorgeous basset hounds.” “Do you turn your household implements into animals often?” Lily said, with the kind of fascination that usually came against better judgment.
~
Steve and Thor were sitting on the couch, watching CNN and eating donuts. “Good morning, Jane,” Thor said in that loud way of his. “Come join us as we eat and learn of current events of the realm.”
~
“Do you enjoy setting fire to things?”
“Yes. Candles, bonfires, lanterns, campfires and cats.”
“Do you ever think about committing suicide?”
“There are at least ten people I’d kill before I killed myself.”
“I’ll take that as a no. Have you suffered any memory loss?”
“I don’t remember.”
~
“Walter does everything for a reason.”
“Yeah, that’s fine. Unless the reason is ‘he’s crazy’.”
~ “It’s not surprising that she recognized me. I am very well known in some circles. Small circles, though. Dots, really.” ~ “I was kidnapped by a pack of mimes. They performed unspeakable acts on me.”
~ “Surgery?” suggested a voice in her head. This voice was not the first sign of madness. It was her partner, Mulch Diggums, communicating from his mike to her earpiece. 
~ “Check out the night vision setting! It’s as clear as…well, day.”
~ “Go on, tell me. In short words, though; you wouldn’t believe the amount of science I had to listen to today.”
~
He felt the tingle that comes when every atom in your body is overloaded with energy and boosted into a gaseous form. It really should be terribly painful, but the body doesn’t really know how to respond to this kind of cell damage, and so throws up a pathetic tingling. 
~
“Really, I’m trying to care about this opera. I truly am. But I thought it was all supposed to be over when the fat lady sings. Well, she’s singing, but it doesn’t appear to be over.”
~
Dematerialization isn’t a particularly painful process, but materialization happens to be a thoroughly enjoyable one. The brain is so happy to register all the body’s essential bits and bobs coming together again that it releases a surge of happy endorphins. 
~ “You’ve hacked into the audio feed?” he asked, sharply. “Just what else can that phone of yours do?”
“It can play solitaire and minesweeper,” she replied, innocently. 
~
He decided that perhaps he should raise his empty hands to show that he wasn’t carrying a weapon, but it’s difficult to do that when you’re tied to a chair. “I’m tied to a chair,” he said, apologetically, as though it were his fault, just in case it was.
~
Manners must be appreciated somewhere outside a book, he had always thought, so he decided to give them a go. He growled, which was the polite demon way of asking to speak in front of your betters. This must not be how humans interpreted it, because the skinny human jumped to his feet, pulling out a knife. 
“No, kind sir,” he said, hurriedly, cobbling together a couple of sentences from Lady Heatherington. “Prithee sheath thine weapon. I bring joyous tidings only.”
~
“Do not compliment the intruder on his technique,” the bodyguard snapped, annoyed.
~ “Why would anyone want to trap us here? And who?”
“I don’t know. Let’s see if anyone tries to kill us and work backwards.”
~ “So, I was in a bar having a drink. Tell me honestly: am I still there?”
~ “Rory, would you mind going with her?”
“Yeah, a bit.”
“Then I’d appreciate it all the more,” she said, clapping him on the back.
Rory sighed. “Hang on, River,” he said unenthusiastically. “I’m coming too.”
~
“What’s through there?”
“No idea.”
“Something bad?”
“Almost certainly.”
“And you’re going to open it?”
“It’s locked! How’s a girl to resist?”
~ “You can tell a lot about a woman from her hands. For instance, if they’re placed around your throat, she’s probably upset.”
~ “True. Crime isn’t all fun and games. It has minor downsides… like fear, pain and death.” 
~
“Was that Maria?” said Artemis, mimicking casual conversation perfectly. Butler was not fooled. Artemis rarely asked casual questions. 
“Yes, that was Maria. You could tell because I used her name when I spoke to her.”
“It’s this blasted puberty, Butler. Every time I see a pretty girl, I waste valuable mind space thinking about her.”
~
“Nod if you can …” he mouthed as the letters appeared, then stopped and began nodding furiously.
~ Minerva scowled. “Look into my heart? Honestly, Papa, I am not a Care Bear.”
“Please, cherie,” said her father. “You know I love you and I respect your genius, but just for once, couldn’t we go with the pony option? Couldn’t I just get Justin Timberguy to play at your birthday party?”
~ “I’m so sick of you smart kids. Why can’t you just boost cars or steal stuff like normal kids?”
“We do steal stuff. Just bigger stuff.”
~ “How do you like the plan so far?”
“Well, I don’t like the first bit and I don’t know the last bit. So I’m really hoping the middle bit is exceptional.”
~ “Should I look scared?”
“That would be appropriate.”
“Good. Shouldn’t be a problem.”
~ Soon, every demon who was able to climb the mountain had done so, and they were all staring at the multicoloured dancing monkey Quinn had conjured in midair. 
“What is that?” the imp asked, entranced.
Quinn fluttered his fingers, causing the monkey to do a somersault. “It’s a simple magical construct. Instead of allowing the sparks to roam on instinct, I marshall them into recognizable form. It takes time and effort, but in time you will have this micro control too—”
“No,” said the imp. “I mean what is that?”
Quinn sighed. “It’s a monkey.”
~
“Sensors?”
“Yes!” seeing the pirate captain’s continued bafflement, the Doctor continued, “Ok, problem word. Seventeenth century. My ship automatically…noticed-ish…that your ship was having some bother.”
“It must be more magic, Captain. How else would they have found their way below-decks?” the first mate piped up.
“Well, I want to say multi-dimensional engineering, but since we had a problem with sensors, I won’t go there,” the Doctor responded.
~ “This body only has about eighteen minutes left to live and this entire universe will end in about three hours. Safe is relative.”
~ “He was standing there? Oh. He must have been redistributed.”
“Which means what?”
“You’re breathing him.”
~
“How long have we got? Um. An hour.  Five seconds. Somewhere in between.”
~ “I hope to someday to meet you in the glory of battle where I shall crush your pathetic human form.”
~ “Welcome. You are unauthorised. You shall experience a tingling sensation and then death. Please remain calm while your life is extracted.”
~ “There is no cure. You will be dead in thirty-two minutes.”
“Why do you keep saying that?”
“Because you will be dead in thirty-two minutes.”
“You see, there you go again: basically skipping thirty-one whole minutes where I’m absolutely fine.”
“You will be fine for thirty-one minutes. You will be dead in thirty-two minutes.”
~
“Pantaphobia. That’s what it’s called. Not fear of pants, in case you’re wondering. It’s fear of everything…including pants, I suppose.”
~
“Good question. Kind of sinister. What’s the answer that won’t get me killed?”
~ “I just need to borrow your brain for a bit. It won’t hurt…probably…almost probably.”
~
“You’re asking me to defy destiny, causality, the nexus of time itself…for a boy?”
~ “Oh, you’ve redecorated. I don’t like it.”
“We’ve moved, actually. It’s a completely different house.”
~
“Why am I here? Social call. Thought it was about time I tried one out. How are you?”
“I’m fine?”
“This is the bit where I say I’m fine too, isn’t it? I’m fine too.”
~ “I’m rubbish at being a dad. I read all the books and they say to follow your instincts. I have no instincts. Or I have rubbish instincts.”
~
“Napoleon gave me this bottle. Well, I say gave. Threw.”
~ “She’s armed, sir. No, wait, unarmed. She’s wearing wool, sir. Natural fabrics interfere with the scanners.”
“Please tell me the scanners can tell the difference between wool and a sidearm.”
“We can, sir. Sometimes.”
~
“Ma’am, please stop your crying. I can’t interrogate you while you’re crying.”
~
“I can’t believe you told Immigration where he lived!”
“Well, I told him that I told Immigration, so maybe he left before they got there.”
~ “Is that a good squeal or a bad squeal?” he asked his fiancé. “I just want to prepare myself, emotionally.”
~
“No, Lawrence just beat me in court today, so I wouldn’t exactly call us friends. Also, I wouldn’t call us friends because I hate him.”
~
“Oh, you really were that bad, but I don’t have time to be angry so you get a pass.”
~
“I find it fundamentally weird that you’re not a dessert person.”
~ “I’d throw this mocha in your face, but it’s not nearly scalding enough.”
~ “This is what is called taking the high road, which I was shocked to find has nothing to do with marijuana.”
~
“Bruce says the percentage risk of failure is very high.”
Clark’s head cocked slightly to the side, “Diana? What does she say?”
Lois looked grave. “That she would have more confidence if you had been created by the Goddesses. And were a woman.”
~
In a tender voice, he asked, “And they’re happy?”
“Happy?” The girl loudly retorted, like this was something of an understatement. “Disgustingly. They kiss each other. All the time.”
“On the lips,” the boy’s grossed-out disapproval was obvious both in expression and tone.
With narrowed eyes, the girl confided, “And they’re old.”
~ “It’s this one,” Merlin said later that afternoon, staring up through the branches of the massive oak. “I’m sure of it.” “I’d be more inclined to believe you if you hadn’t said the same thing about the last four trees.”
~
“Aren’t you supposed to know this sort of thing?” “What, about laying eggs? Because I hate to shatter any illusions you might have, but I am absolutely lacking in necessary parts.” “About chickens, and animals, and other,” Arthur made a vague gesture, “peasant sort of things.”  “I’ve never forced a chicken to lay eggs. You usually just let it alone and it, you know. Happens.” Arthur’s eyes lit up with sudden inspiration. “Do you think maybe it’s nervous with us watching it like this?”
~ “You’ve done well,” he said, and despite everything, Merlin couldn’t help but feel a little thrill of pride at the praise.  “Wonderful,” Merlin said, sitting up. “Um. What did I do?”  His father hesitated. “Wait,” Merlin said, “Let me guess: that’s a truth for which I’m not yet ready.”
~ “On the up side, nobody’s panicking,” says Ned, straight-faced.
“Practice,” says Moira glumly.
~ Arthur tuned out their inane bickering, instead searching through the front pocket of his bag until he found the original letter. “We’re here because of this letter.” He held the coaster aloft, triumphant. Mac and Charlie didn’t notice. “We’re here because of this letter,” he repeated, in his outside voice. “No,” Mac was saying, “I’m pretty sure you’re thinking about Spiderman.” “We’re here because of this letter,” Arthur repeated, for the third and final time. With his gun.
~
“You?” said Mrs Granger. “Organise the whole wedding?”
“Apparently it’s an ancient and honourable wizarding tradition for the best man to do it,” Harry said. It was impossible to feel offended by the look on her face when it was so perfectly expressive of what he himself was feeling.
~ “They’re the weak links in the chain. Have you ever used a chain with three weak links? I did, and now I have one less arctic wolf.”
~ “Don’t be defeatist,” the dowager countess reprimanded her, sternly. “It’s very middle-class.”
~ “You love what I’ve done with my hair? But I haven’t done anything with my hair.”
“Exactly!” replied Flakk quickly. “It’s so incredibly you. What do you think of my outfit?”
“One’s attention is drawn straight to it,” I replied ambiguously.
~
He tried to smile several times but eventually gave up and offered his hand for me to shake instead.
“Would you be upset if I didn’t shake it?” I asked him.
“Well, yes,” he replied, trying to be affable.
“Good.”
~ “The floor manager will cue you and you’ll enter. I’ll ask you some questions to get started. I may offer you some toast at some point as our sponsors, the toast Marketing Board, like to get a plug in now and again.”
~ “Late wedding present, I think It’s a—” He looked at the strange knitted object curiously. “It’s a …thing.”
“Good,” I replied, “I always wanted one of those. What are you doing?”
“I’m trying to teach Pickwick to stand on one leg.”
“Dodos don’t do tricks,” I told him.
“For a marshmallow I think I can make him do anything.”
~
“What sort of competition?” I asked suspiciously, wondering whether it could be any more daft than her “win a mammoth” idea the week before. 
~
“This hurts me really personally when you’re like this. It attacks me right—right—er—here.” She made a wild guess at where her heart might be and looked at me with a pained expression that she probably learnt off a Springer spaniel. 
~
“That’s my partner. There’s a 12-14 or a 10-30 or …something numerological in progress. Gotta go!”
~
“Blasted brambles!” he muttered as he shook our hands.
~ “I think we met at my niece Gloria’s wedding? What was that sad old fart who made a nuisance of himself on the dance floor?”
“I think that was you, sir.”
~
“Bought one of those new Mustangs, I see. How do you find it?”
“Usually where I left it, sir.”
~ “Pretty fishy that it should just turn up. How fishy, though, on the fishiness scale? Ten is a stickleback and one is a whale shark.”
“A whale isn’t a fish, Trudy.”
“A whale shark is—sort of.”
“Alright, it’s as fishy as a crayfish.”
“A crayfish isn’t a fish,” I told him.
“A starfish, then.”
“Still not a fish.”
“A silverfish.”
“This a very odd conversation.”
~
“There’s a ChronoGuard labour dispute. They’re on strike for shorter hours. Not actually less hours, you understand, just the hours that they do work they want to be—er—shorter.”
~
He went rogue seventeen years ago when his historical and moral difference brought him into conflict with the ChronoGuard High Chamber. The downside of this was that he didn’t really exist at all in any accepted terms of the definition; the ChronoGuard had interrupted his conception in 1917 by a well-timed knock on his parents’ front door. 
~ “It could be. I’ll give them a call and ask.” He put out his hand to pick up the phone just as it started to ring. “Hello?...It’s not, you say? Okay, thanks.” He put the phone down. “The ChronoGuard say it’s not.”
~
“They’re both dead,” I said quietly.
“Was it Hades?”
“Freak accident laying linoleum.”
~ “Hell-ooo!” yelled Landon from his study. “Do you like surprises?”
“When they’re nice ones!” I yelled back. 
~
Pickwick returned to my side, plock-plocked some more and tugged the leg of my jeans. He scuttled off into the kitchen and waited for me at his basket. Intrigued, I followed. In the middle of the basked, amongst a large heap of shredded paper, was an egg.
“Pickwick!” I cried excitedly. “You’re a girl!”
~ “I never thought of Mycroft retiring. What do you suppose he’ll do?” 
“Watch ‘Name That Fruit!’ most likely. He says that soaps and quiz shows are the ideal way to fade out. He’s not far wrong. After a few years of ‘65 Walrus Street’, death might become something of a welcome distraction.”
~ “We didn’t know the nature of lightning or rainbows for three and a half million years, pet. Don’t reject it just because it seems impossible. If we closed our minds, there would never be the thermos flasks. No one has the least idea why they work,” replied Mycroft, cleaning the blackboard and drawing a crude picture of a thermos with a question mar; “You will agree that a vacuum flask keeps things hot in the winter and cold things cold in the summer? Well, how does it know? I’ve studied vacuum flasks for many years and not one of them gave any clues as to their inherent seasonal cognitive ability.”
~ “Imagine a box with a partition—the left side is filled with gas, the right a vacuum. Remove the partition and the gas will expand into the other side of the box. You wouldn’t expect the gas to cramp itself in the left-hand side again, would you? But, since every interaction of gas atom is reversible, sometime, sooner or later, the gas must cramp itself back into the left-hand side! The key here is how much later. Since even a small box of gas might contain 1020 atoms, the time taken for them to try all possible combinations would take far longer than the age of the universe; a decrease in entropy strong enough to allow gas to separate, a shattered glass to reform or the statue of St. Zvlkx to get down and walk to the pub is not, I think, against any physical laws but just fantastically unlikely.”
~
“I apologise for the current lack of scandal. I know this makes your lives boring and difficult,” he told the reporters. “I’m sure someone will do something stupid or illegal soon. In fact, if I were you, I’d count on it.”
~ “Did you show her your memory erasure device, Crofty?”
“No, he didn’t,” I said.
“Yes, I did,” replied Mycroft with a smile. 
~ “The bit about orphaned amputees is good,” I said, trying not to dishearten him. “What are you going to call it?”
~
The doorbell rang. “Who could that be?”
“It’s a little early to tell,” quipped Landen. “I understand the ‘go and see’ technique sometimes works.”
~ “Have you met my associates, Mr. Chalk and Mr. Cheese?” I looked at his gorillalike lackeys. They were immaculately dressed, had impeccably trimmed goatees, and stared at me through impenetrable dark glasses. 
“Which is which?” I asked.
“I’m Cheese,” said Cheese.
“I’m Chalk,” said Chalk.
~
“I’ll become a victim of corporate impatience? What is that, some sort of threat?”
“This unhelpful attitude of yours might make me vindictive—you wouldn’t like me when I’m vindictive.”
“I don’t like you now.”
~ Stiggin’s normally placid and unmoving face curled up into a grimace that shows two rows of widely gapped teeth. I was fearful for a moment until I realised that what I was witnessing was a Neanderthal smile. 
~
“Oh, crap. How can I tell her that I thrust sharpened stakes through the undead and hunt down werewolves like some sort of dogcatcher?” He stopped and sighed, then asked, in a brighter tone, “You’re a woman, aren’t you?”
“Last time I looked.”
~ “Have you tried Edmund Spenser’s ‘The Faerie Queen’? Six volumes of boring Spenserian stanza, the only saving grace of which is that he didn’t write the twelve volumes he had planned.”
~ “Trouble at MoleTV,” continued the anchorman, “and a bitter blow for the producers of ‘Surviving Cortes’, the channel’s popular Aztec conquering re-enactment series when, instead of simply voted out of the sealed set of Tenochtitlan, a contestant was sacrificed to the Sun God. The show has been cancelled and an inquiry has been launched. MoleTV were said to be ‘sorry and dismayed about the incident’ but pointed out that the show was ‘the highest-rated on TV, even after the blood sacrifice.’ Back to you in the studio, Brett.”
~
“I don’t have a bag,” I explained. She looked at me oddly, so I added: “Well, I did, but you lost it the last time I travelled. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever had a bag returned to me after travelling with you.”
She thought about it for a moment and then said: “If you had a bag and if you had packed it yourself, and if you had not left it unattended, might it contain any of the following?” She showed me a list of prohibited items and I shook my head. “Would you like an in-flight meal?”
“What are my choices?”
“Yes or no.”
“No.”
She looked at the next question on her sheet. “Who would you prefer to sit next to?”
“Nun or knitting granny, if that’s possible.”
“Hmm,” mused the check-in girl, studying the passenger manifest carefully. “All nuns, grannies and intelligent non-amorous males are taken. It’s technobore, lawyer, self-pitying drunk or copiously vomiting baby, I’m afraid.”
~ “I’m not sure I’ve heard of that.”
“It’s quite common. I suppose you have heard of knight blindness, when you can’t see any knights.”
~
“You’re the Cheshire Cat, aren’t you?”
“I was the Cheshire Cat,” he replied, with a slightly aggrieved air. “But they moved the county boundaries, so technically speaking, I’m now the Unitary Authority of Warrington Cat, but it doesn’t have the same ring to it.”
~ “It’s not that you didn’t know you could do this. What you mean is that you did know that you couldn’t—it’s quite a different thing.”
~
“I may summon you at any time and you will come running. Only funerals, childbirth or Vivaldi concerts take precedence.”
~ “No—” I mumbled. “That is to say—yes.”
“I’ll try harder questions in future,” announced Miss Havisham, “for you are obviously not adept at the easy ones.”
~
“And anyhow, you can’t nearly kill someone. Either they’re dead or they are not.”
~
It took two hours for me to convince the police I wasn’t going to tell them anything. Undeterred, they thumbed through a yellowed statute book and eventually charged me with a little-known 1621 law about ‘permissioning a horse and carte to be driven by personn of low moral turpithtude’, but with the ‘horse and carte’ bit crossed out and ‘car’ written in instead.
~
“SpecOps 5?”
“Yes, how did—” he checked himself quickly and rummaged for a pair of dark glasses. “I mean, no. Never heard of SpecOps, much less SpecOps-5. Don’t exist. Oh blast. I’m not very good at this, I’m afraid.”
“What happened to Dedmen and Walken?” I asked him.
“They were—” began the first agent, but the second one nudged him in the ribs and announced instead: “Never heard of them.” I just stared at him until he caved. “They were reassigned.”
“You mean dead.”
“No,” he exclaimed with some surprise. “I mean reassi—Oh my goodness! Is that what it means?”
“What are your orders?”
“Classified,” announced Agent 1, who was getting the hang of SpecOps-5 work, right at the point I didn’t want him to.
~ Zorf refused to sell any paintings to who couldn’t see what they were, but to Neanderthals who could see what they were he gave them away, arguing that the bond between a painting and an owner should not be sullied by anything as obscenely sapien as cash. 
~ A note painted on the glass read: IN UNPRECEDENTED EMERGENCY* BREAK GLASS. The asterisk, I noted somewhat chillingly, related to the footnote: *Please note: personal destruction does NOT count as an unprecedented emergency.
~
“Tte capture of Supreme Evil Beings, or SEBs, as we call them, is our main bread and butter work. How there can be more than one Supreme Evil Being, I have no idea. Every SEB I ever captured considered itself not only the worst personification of unadulterated evil that ever stalked the earth. It must have been quite a surprise—and not a little galling—to be locked away with several thousand other SEBs, all pretty much the same.”
~
“I wrote Cindy some poetry,” said Spike softly, rummaging in his pocket. “If anything happens, will you give it to her?”
“Give it to her yourself. Nothing’s going to happen—you said so yourself. And don’t say things like that; it gives me the wobblies.”
~ “It’s like trying to snatch a trout from a mountain stream with a boxing glove.”
~
“Isn’t there a Plan C?”
“Shit no!” replied Spike as he fumbled with the key. “B is as high as I ever get.”
~
“This isn’t just any vacuum cleaner. You see, unlike conventional vacuum cleaners, this one works on a dual cyclone principles that traps dust and evil spirits by a powerful centrifugal forces. There’s even a hose action—and a small brush for stair carpets.’’
“You find evil spirits in stair carpets?”
“No, but my stair carpets need cleaning just the same as anyone else’s.” 
~
“Are you talking about a seeing a shrink? Because I have not and will not go to any therapy that is not court ordered.”
~
“We can tell everyone you have water retention or an eating disorder brought on by stress. No, that won’t work. Can you get married really quickly to someone? What about Bowden? Bowden, would you do the decent thing for the sake of the company?”
~ “The chapter is over and besides, this book is written in the third person. We are free to do what we please until tomorrow morning, when the new chapter begins. I would so hate to be a first person character! Always on your guard, always having people reading your thoughts. Here we do what we are told but think what we wish.”
~
“Oh come on, don’t you ever wear jeans? You look like you should be distracting James Bond at a baccarat table.”
~ “Visualise something—an albatross, say. Okay, now take the albatross away. Now take another albatross away.”
“How can I? There are no albatrosses left.”
“Okay, imagine I have lent you an albatross to make up your seabird deficit. How many albatrosses have you now?”
“None.”
“Good, now relax while I take my albatross back.”
~ “I’m no expert, but that one looked suspiciously like an adjectivore. Can you see the gunport it was feeding on? Describe it to me.” I looked at the gunport and frowned. I had expected it to be old or dark or wooden or rotten or wet, but it wasn’t .But then it wasn’t sterile or blank or empty either—it was simply a gunport, nothing more or less. “The adjectivore feeds on the adjectives describing the noun,” she explained, “but it generally leaves the noun intact.”
~
“They’re not going to take a bullet. If you try and shoot one, chances are they’ll just Jump.”
“It sounds a bit like testing for witches. If they sink and drown, they’re innocent—”
~ “I think your dodo is hungry,” observed Catia, as Pickwick performed her ‘starving dodo’ routine for her on the kitchen floor.
“It’s a scam for marshmallows,” I replied absently. 
~
“There’s going to be an accident.”
“Absolutely impossible!” he scoffed, throwing the doors open to reveal a mass of spinning red lights and the raucous sounding of a klaxon. “Heavens!” exclaimed Wilbur. “Do you think it’s meant to be doing that.?”
~ “We’re in the middle of an isolated high-coincidental localized entropic field decreasement.”
“We’re in a what?”
“We’re in a pseudoscientific technobabble.”
“Ah!” replied Wilbur, having witnessed quite a few at his last job. “One of those.”
~ “Nobody leaves until I get an answer,” he yelled at the hostages.
“Might help if we knew the question,” she replied.
~
“I think you’re being paranoid.”
“And I think you’re being unbelievably naive.”
~ “Option number three: alien abduction. Kind of improbable, but I thought it should be mentioned.”
~ “Listen, when you go home tonight you’re going to feel the urge to drink. Indulge that urge. Don’t try to be a hero.”
~
“Ah, Los Angeles: where using a turn signal is viewed as a sign of personal weakness.”
~ “I think I’m a little drunk. I just tried to text him with the remote control.”
~
“This term ‘on your mind’ vexes me with its descriptive inaccuracy.”
“Would you please talk like a normal person?”
~
It is a language which is good for telling people what to do while mining. There are many words for push, take, shove, carry, load, and no words for love or happiness or the sounds which birds make in the morning. 
~
“I am aware that his feelings run deeper and warmer than ordinary friendship.”
~ “Was he cross?”
“I could not say, madam. However, upon receiving the information, his cheeks were suffused with a darker hue and he attempted to kick a passing cat.”
~ “What is that stuff? You’re not on any medication, Walter.”
“Of course I am. I made it myself. I’ve been mixing it up in the lab.”
~
“Alright. Enough already. We get it.”
“Actually,” she interjected. “I don’t quite get it yet.”
“Honestly? Me either, but I just want him to stop talking.”
~ “It’d just be a minor surgery.”
“Minor brain surgery. Emphasis not on the minor.”
~
“So what? We just knock on the door and ask if we can rip their walls out to look for evidence? I guess the badge works as the ‘pretty please’ in this situation.”
~ “This demonstration is far more effective with living tissue—I have some expendable gerbils in the back…”
~
“Their annual budget for corporate espionage could feed a midsize nation. I guarantee you they’ll have something on him.”
~ “You have a friend at the National Reconnaissance Office with access to satellites?” she said, with just a trace of disbelief.
“I have a friend who’s cracked their control systems,” he admitted.
~ “You really think you’re going to win this? I have a law firm on retainer that charges more per hour than you make in a month.”
~ He doesn’t say anything for the longest time, just stares at her with no expression she can read, then breaks the silence with, “I dream of forever. With you.” He offers the words defiantly, like he’s daring her to protest, and his eyes are guarded.
~
She’s kind of fuzzy, but he can see Olivia smiling down at him. “I just need you to answer a few questions for me, okay?” He blinks, which she seems to take as an affirmative. “Do you know what day it is?”
He ponders for a second, and decides, “No.”
She looks faintly alarmed. “You don’t?”
Peter shakes his head. “It was Wednesday, but I don’t know how long I’ve been sleeping. So it’s either still Wednesday or now it’s Thursday.”
~
“And no one should be awake at four in the morning.”
“Be sure to explain that to the three-month-old while you’re changing her diaper,” Olivia says without sympathy, snuggling back into a comfortable position.
~
“Are you telling me this woman is channelling the ghost of Elvis Presley?” Some days, Olivia feels like her life is caught on loop in an old season of The X Files, and the writers think themselves overly clever.  “Nonsense,” Walter responds. “Everybody knows Elvis is still alive.”
~
Winston’s eyes were mournful when they met Peter’s, conveying a sense of suffering that brought a little smile to Peter’s face. Winston glanced around the dimly lit bar one last time, looking for anyone else that might be there to give away government secrets. “Please tell me you are here to meet someone else.”
Peter grinned. “It’s good to see you too, Winston.”
“Oh, hell, no. You are not my contact at the FBI. You’re not even with the FBI. You’re friends with Guerrero,” Winston spat.
~ I’m about 90% sure that Coca-Cola in this dimension still contains cocaine. Also, Coke here is green. Not sure why that is. Not sure I want to ask, either. The taste is about the same, though. Maybe even a little better.
~
“It’s a bad sign when “invent time travel” is starting to look like your Plan A.”
~ “I was right all along! Ergo, I’m not insane!”
“And saying so at volume is not going to convince the committee anymore than the first dozen times you said it,” Olivia says calmly.
~
“Walter.” Peter pitched his voice low to avoid attracting Olivia’s attention. “If time was broken, how could you tell?”
Walter mumbled around a mouthful of candy. “Time is a construct we impose on infinity in order to make the concept manageable to our rather limited brains.”
~ There was a crack of apparition outside. When Kingsley stepped through, Fred snapped out the test question, by reflex, “What is your greatest ambition?”
“Fred, you can’t, we don’t know–” George began, but Kingsley cut him off. In his deep bass voice, he said, “Buggering Remus Lupin.”
A soft snort from Lupin, and they lowered their wands, inch by inch. “A word to the wise, gentlemen,” Kingsley said. “Don’t ask questions you don’t know the answers to, for heaven’s sake.”
“Double-plus points for that answer, though,” said Lupin, who was smiling wryly, though now slumped on the floor with the twins. “If any Death Eater in disguise had tried to say that, the words would have turned to ashes in their mouths.”
~
“If it turns out you can make better Dungbombs out of it, let me know. Or, indeed, a quick and easy way to fill a room with flowerpots.”
“Why did you do that?” Lupin asked, apparently genuinely curious. “I knew your reputation, of course. I was sure there must be some hidden gem of wit in that particular detour into surrealism, but I never figured it out.”
“They were supposed to have actual flowers in them,” Fred confessed. “I never was very good at inanimate-to-animate transfiguration, so it sort of went wrong.” Off Lupin’s blank look, he added, “Flowers. Pink ones. Lupins.”
~
“My advice for getting through it? Keep thinking about what you’re going to do when the war is over,” Lupin said thoughtfully. “That’s important. Even if it’s just getting very, very drunk.”
~
Harry sits up on the armchair so fast, he falls off. Fumbling for his wand out of long habit, he stares and it clatters to the floor.
“Boy, for the savoir of the wizarding world, you have crap reflexes,” Ginny says, hands on hips. 
~
“We can’t all wallow up in our beds forever.”
“I wasn’t wallowing, and it was an armchair!” Harry says hotly.
~
“I’m...I’m sorry for—” he begins awkwardly. For your husband, for your son, for your cousins, for your very insane sister. But he can’t finish the thought vocally, just fidgets and looks down.
“Thank you,” Andromeda says kindly. “Nymphadora told me you’re a bit stunted socially, so don’t worry about explaining. I understand the sentiment.”
~
“Teddy,” Harry says, “Tell Ginny that she shouldn’t blacken my good name, as it’s not my fault she is crap at Levitation charms.”
“Crap!” the toddler coos, patting Ginny’s shoulder. “Crap charms, Ginny.”

“Bow ties are cool,” the Doctor said stubbornly.
“So you keep telling us,” Amy said, rolling her eyes. “Still, it’s better than the fez.”
“I don’t know,” Rory disagreed. “I almost like the fez.”
Amy mock-glared at him. “Traitor.”
~
“If you want to get changed, don’t mind me,” he says, waving a vague hand. “I’ll just stare at the floor for a bit, it’s very interesting.”
“I don’t mind,” Rory says, because he really doesn’t – he used to change into scrubs in front of an entire hospital and into plate-metal armour in front of an entire Roman legion.
~
“Oh, look at you, though!” the man gushes. “Kate Beckett. Sight for sore eyes and no mistake. Brilliant! With your jacket, and your badge, and your... hair...” he drifts off, staring at Beckett’s hair, puzzled.
There’s an awkward pause.
“Yeah well,” the man continues brightly. “I mean, you can’t always have good hair, can you? Still, there’s not many women who’d say “Yeah, I don’t care what my hair looks like! I’ll go out with terrible hair if I want!” Well done you!”
~ “Sure,” Esposito agrees, sharing another look with Ryan, “if you call ‘conspiracy to commit murder’, ‘impersonating a police officer’, ‘disturbing the scene of a crime’ and ‘obstruction of justice’ a misunderstanding.”
“We were not impersonating!” the man snaps back defensively, apparently not noticing the other pressing matters in the hypothetical charge-sheet he was facing. “There was no impersonation. They merely assumed!”

“So yeah,” the man rambles on, as if Ryan hadn’t spoke, “bit of a situation. Donna and me— this is Donna, by the way,” Donna nods with resigned politeness and wiggles her fingers as best she can in greeting, “we’re just looking into something— not much yet, I don’t think, but potentially a bit, well, apocalyptic, let’s not mince words, and there’s something very nasty going on in this street and I think it somehow involves that poor bloke they’re talking about who got killed— and I know you love mysteries, don’t want to spoil the ending for you, but if you’re looking for suspects, well, I’d take anyone human off that list personally—”
“Oh, for heaven’s sake!” the woman— Donna— suddenly explodes. “We’re under arrest, it’s hot, and my wrists hurt. I don’t want to go to jail; you say she can get us out of this, so shut up, tell her to what you need to tell her, let her do it and let’s just get on with it.”
The Doctor looks puzzled. “Shut up and tell her—”
~ He turned the other way and almost collided with a woman selling figs. Beyond her, five malevolent-looking quadrupeds were tethered to a wooden rail. Camels — dromedaries? Camels? You go about calculating the quantum waveform-collapse point of neutron stars with no trouble, but the old one-hump-or-two thing is always a toss-up. Like whether you’re supposed to feed a cold and starve a fever, or starve a cold and feed a fever. Really ought to get that one down, being a Doctor and all. They must be camels, he decided, and also made a mental note to scare up a new Companion at some point because rambling on like that in his head was much more unsettling than doing it aloud to someone else. He glanced around and then strolled casually over to them. “Were you talking to me?” he asked the nearest one politely.
~ “I smelled it on him a mile off.” The Hrnu sniffed the air delicately. “Time travel. Smells like pomegranates.”
“Brilliant! I never knew that,” the Doctor said. “I’m the Doctor.”
“Gene. That’s Maud, Mildred, and Cornelius.” Gene the Hrnu Not A Camel nodded his head expressively.
“What about h....er?” the Doctor guessed, pointing to the fifth one.
“He’s a camel,” Gene said impatiently.
“We just call him Sticks,” Maud said, flaring her prodigious nostrils.
“Why do you—” The Doctor got a good look at the legs on the fifth member of the retinue, then decided he didn’t really need to ask.
~
“I said, where...I’m from...we believe...um…camels,” he said finally. “That’s right. The whole world is the hump on a camel’s back.”
“Interesting,” Balthasar looked thoughtful. “As in...just a hump? Or is there a camel attached?”
“Oh, you know...theology,” the Doctor waved a hand.
~ His interior coat pocket produced the sonic screwdriver, a left-handed glove (he’d been looking for that, but he’d already thrown out the right-handed one), and a small flask; his back trouser pocket proved to have a small rubber duck in it, but no cards. The humans watched with growing amusement as he stood and rifled his front pockets. TARDIS key, bit of string, random stopwatch — Jack was probably looking for that — couple of coins...
~ Casey found him in a dark and empty bar called The Light. It was the kind of place Dan liked. With strange drinks and strange music and pretentious lighting, vaguely trendy yet persistently unpopular, dark and private, sofas and cushions and attractive, discreet staff. The kind of place that opened and closed within three months and made more money off Dan than anybody else. He had a knack for finding these places. Taking girls there, and then being unable to go back once the girl had dumped him. 
“I assume the name of this place is meant to be ironic,” said Casey.
“I think irony is something a little more subtle than that.” “No,” said Casey. “I have a keen sense of irony.” “It’s failing you.” “I’ll accept that possibility.”
 “You getting a drink? Maybe get me another one while you’re up.” He raised his glass of red liquid. “This is called a Red Light.” “Clever.”
“I believe they also offer the Blue Light, the Green Light, and the White Light.” “I see what they’ve done there. What’s in them?” “Alcohol,” said Dan. “Sugar. Sugar and alcohol. And colours.”
~
“You’re one of my top two favourite sports anchors.” “Is the other one you?” Casey said. “Yes,” said Dan.
~
“I’m all for fixing this,” Pete said, gesturing around, “but isn’t it bad to travel through time? Like, if I meet my past self…BOOM!”
Claudia shook herself and simply said, “I’m in.”
~ “We’re talking Saw levels of blood,” Claudia added, then reached up to pick something off of Steve’s collar. “I don’t want to think about what this is.”
She flicked it aside and H.G. peered at it. “That would be brain tissue.”
“I said I didn’t want to know!” Claudia groaned.
~ “He’s going to kill me!”
“Oh, stop being so dramatic. What did he actually say?”
“‘I’m going to kill you.’”
“Oh, that ain’t good.”
~ “But if you ever do it again, I will personally harvest one of your organs with my thumbnail.”
~ “Shall I get the door?”
“Absolutely not.” He replied cheerfully. “In fact, it would be my preference if you could be someplace else all together.”
~
“A drink, drink? Or just, you know, a drink?” Kim asks again, giving Natalie a wicked glance that makes her roll her eyes.
“The kind where they pour alcohol into a glass,” Dana says firmly.
“I do like alcohol,” Natalie agrees.
“Especially when they put it in a glass,” Kim chimes in.
~ She breathed deeply, and her face formed into a fair copy of the ‘I’m counting to ten so I don’t throttle you and dump your lifeless body in the lake’ expression McGonagall wore whenever she was in James’ general vicinity
~ Peter really didn’t like the sound of that. James’ definition of ‘brilliant’ was very different than the one printed in Wyvernshire’s Wizarding English, in that James generally equated it with things like ‘dangerous’ and ‘explosive.’ Or ‘grounds for expulsion.’
~ “Oh, don’t mind me, you’re no bother at all,” Remus grumbled, flattening a parchment Sirius had wrinkled in his flailing. “It’s my bed and that, but I’m just passing through.” Sirius sat up a bit more. “Your bed?” He peered suspiciously at his own; the hangings gave an ominous rustle. “How did that happen?”  “Well,” James said, favouring Sirius with an arch smile, “Remus must have shagged you to sleep.” “Jealousy really doesn’t suit you, James,” Remus countered airily. “Besides, you’ve nothing to worry about. He screamed your name the entire time.” “I hate you both,” Sirius declared, flashing a rude gesture to all and sundry as James and Remus dissolved into snickers. Peter ducked just as one of Remus’ books was hurled in his general direction without regard to incidentals like aim. “I hope you all die in a terrible, smelly Potions accident.”
~
“Of course,” James said, with a smile that made a good argument for him being criminally insane.
~ He resented the suspicious glower she was casting in his general direction, mainly because he hadn’t done anything to deserve it. Not today, anyway.
~
“Five pounds?” James asked, in what was possibly the furthest thing from his indoor voice. “Have you forgotten the terms of the treaty?” 
“Which treaty? The one about wanking and Silencing Charms and putting a tie on the doorknob when you’re, you know... entertaining?”  “No, that’s the Secrecy of Goods and Services Act,” Sirius said, waving his hand. “He means the one about curtains, furry animals, storing monkshood at room temperature, and that broom cupboard down in Slytherin that only opens on odd-numbered days of the month.”  “Fartparcels,” James grumbled. “I mean the Profit and Loss Agreement of 1973, the one that goes...” he nudged Remus with his elbow, “How does it go, Moony?”  “Whereby, all punishments meted, including but not limited to detentions, banishments, and letters written home, will be served by the accused, without regard to innocence or guilt, lest a fellow Marauder betray one of his comrades in arms,” Remus recited. “Furthermore, all spoils earned, given, or otherwise gained shall be shared equally and without reservation, with the exception of Marmite, tinned fish, invitations to Slughorn’s office, and the favours of Lily Evans.”  Sirius chewed his lip thoughtfully. “I thought there was something in there about Snape’s underpants.” “Codicil Three, Sections Sixteen and Seventeen,” Remus said. “And, if it is noted that Severus Snape, hereafter known as Snivellus, happens to—” “Right.” James reached for the rucksack and the five pounds of chocolate frogs contained therein. “Under the treaty, there is no hoarding.” 
~
“They’re just so... so... despicable.” Evans nodded firmly, her hands planted on her hips. Remus wondered if women learned that gesture from their mothers, or if it was just natural instinct.
~ James, who was somehow shrieking like a girl and cursing like a marooned and drunken pirate at precisely the same time, tackled Peter quite mercilessly. Peter bellowed like a Nogtail in heat and loosed a full-armed slap that glanced off James’ ear before catching Sirius’ hip. Hissing, James made a desperate grab for Peter’s hair; this overbalanced Sirius and, with a noise that suggested he’d been a banshee in a former life, he crashed loudly to the ground. He righted himself and clamoured over Peter’s head as best he could with half his foot in James’ mouth, shouting smelly nancing fuck of a wanksack to no one in particular as he shoved James into the wardrobe.
“Have I come at a bad time?” Remus asked. 
~ Well?” Severus demanded. “What are we going to do about it?” “Oh,” Nott replied, surprise dancing across his face. Connors’ shoulders developed a defeated slump. “We haven’t got that far yet.” Really, an invitation to a secret society had seemed like a good idea at the time. Retribution, and that. He’d also been promised tea and biscuits.
~
“Well, there was a small incident concerning my ability to cook and perhaps some mention of my mother.” Putting my hands behind my back, I stood at partial attention and stared just over her shoulder in approved military fashion for lying through my teeth. “But it was nothing. I certainly don’t hold any grudges.”
~
Inevitably, she is shot. It takes him five minutes to get to the hospital. He’ll remember it as much longer.
~
“Are you going to invite me in?”
“Do I need to? Are you a vampire?”
~
“Maggie, let me handle this.”
“You can’t even handle me.”
~
“What, this?” Remus asked, holding out his hand. A brownish smudge darkened the centre of his palm, and to James’ horror, he licked it. “You’ll have that, when you find yourself at the business end of a stampede, and your only means of escape is blocked because this—” he flapped a hand at Sirius “–was attempting, and apparently failing, to murder his brother in the middle of the hallway.” Sirius pushed past Remus and stalked to James’ bed. “I was winning,” he muttered darkly.” His nose was bloody, his lip was split, and he sported a large bruise on his temple. “He never would’ve kneed me in the bollocks, not if Remus hadn’t been standing on my arm.”
~
Sirius made the sort of noise often associated with angered tea kettles. “We do not!” “You’d pass for twins, if Regulus would grow an inch,” Remus argued. He bent to untie his shoes; James thought he mumbled something about inbreeding as he descended, and family trees with very short roots.
~
“Slughorn? Oh. I was after Mulciber,” Peter admitted, his face crumpling. “He called me a fat lump the other day, and I think he meant to hex me, but James came along. Then he said James was a speccy git and ran off after Avery.” 
“Peter,” James said, wondering if he could curse all of Slytherin at dinner without McGonagall cottoning on. “Why didn’t you say something?” Revenge was no longer an option, it was a moral imperative. James had found a Food Poisoning Hex in the Restricted Section the other night; he’d been saving it as a Valentine’s Day present for Snape, but the current situation called for drastic and immediate action. Needs must, and all that. “We would’ve been late for Ancient Runes,” Peter replied reasonably.
~
“He was spouting the usual song and dance, then?” Remus asked. “I’m cheating at Defence, abusing my Prefecture to win the House Cup, and shagging you and James blind every chance I get? Stop me when it starts to sound familiar.” James snorted. “Regulus is clearly a nutter. I wouldn’t let you anywhere near my arse.”
~
“The one with the—” he made a slightly suggestive gesture, but it lost something in translation due to the sandwich in his hand “—you know, the breasts.”
~
She favoured James and Sirius with the sort of frown usually reserved for large piles of dragon dung.
~ An extremely uncomfortable silence curled around them, during which James and Sirius seethed, Remus frowned like he was flirting with the idea of a double murder and, out of a concern for his general health and safety, Peter pointedly avoided looking at the lot.
~
“Depends on the complexity of the code. Could take an hour to crack, could take a year.”
“Shoot for the first one.”
~ “Did I mention I hate you?”  Wrinkling his nose, Remus scrutinised the corridor that led to Hufflepuff. “Once or twice, yes.”
“Detest. Despise.” “Abhor?” Remus ventured, smiling. “Loathe?”  “That, too.”
~ “I’ll try not to—and that’s when Cuthbert the Cantankerous returned to his village,” Remus said loudly, as two Hufflepuff girls materialised out of ruddy nowhere. He pointed to a portrait hanging near James’ elbow, and James pasted on an attentive face. “He travelled for many years, you see, looking for the hag who’d cursed his male line.”
~
“EMT says to use the can and take the rest of the day off, but I assume you’re only going to follow half that advice.”
~ “Well, they said five to ten minutes, but that was five minutes ago so five.”
~
At the very least, she was more attractive than the French troglodyte his mother expected him to marry when he came of age. Sophie Devereaux came from a wealthy family with an unbroken pureblood line that stretched back to the Roman conquest of Gaul, and as far as his mother was concerned, that far outweighed his loud and numerous objections to her face.
~
“Merlin’s spotty arse,” Remus snapped. His mother blamed the lycanthropy for all the grey in his hair, but his mother had never met James Potter. “You’re bloody unbelievable.”
~
Remus mostly looked nauseated. Peter had opted for horribly apologetic, his face squashed into the type of penitent expression Sirius had never really mastered — he suspected his bloodlines were to blame; his hatred for his family didn’t change the fact that Blacks simply were not bred to say ‘I’m sorry’ — but James seemed somewhat twitchy. He was also suspiciously pink around the edges in a way that screamed ‘I’m terribly guilty’ at an ear-splitting volume, and Sirius wasted a full minute of what McGonagall undoubtedly though was precious time wishing he had the power to explode things with his mind. Preferably James’ head, because James was an utter plank. This was entirely James’ fault. In fact, this was more James’ fault than anything else in the long and often awkward history of Things That Were James’ Fault.
~
“Enough,” McGonagall snapped, disregarding him with a wave. “I have no interest in what I am sure would be an entertaining collection of tall tales, pointed fingers, and well-rehearsed excuses.” She narrowed her eyes at each of them in turn — beginning with Peter, who quietly turned the colour of good wine, and ending with Remus, who shrank down in his chair in a way that said he hoped his robes would do him a favour and strangle him — and made a terribly Scottish noise in the back of her throat.
~
“A pre-nup can be tough for some couples, but the good news is that if you can make it through this, you can make it through anything…and that is a figure of speech and not a binding legal promise.”
~
“Big Eddie? As in, Big Eddie DiFalco?”
The rat-like man waved upon hearing his name. “The one and only.”
“I thought you’d be...bigger,” Lincoln said.
Big Eddie just shrugged. “The name helps with the reputation.”
~
“Honey, would you mind excusing us for a moment so that I can express my extreme irritation with George in private.” “Of course, my love. But, please, hurry, because every moment that we are parted is an unbearable agony. “
~
“What’s the first rule of weapons training? Have fun!”
“I would have gone with safety.”
~ “My skin is so dry it has a British accent.”
~ “And I am not cold because I am warmed by the heat of my convictions.”
~ “It’s been more than a week. Don’t tell me you’re on his side,” he said. 
“Well, the alternative is being your side.”
“God forbid.”
~
“You’re not thirsty?” he said. It seemed like a reasonable diversion to him. Apparently it was reasonable to her, too, and she went back to busily slouching.
~ “That thing with the orange soda,” she clarified. As if there had been more than one thing with the orange soda.
“When you made me your unwitting pawn, yeah, I remember that. So what does he think?” Before she could answer he put on a terrible B-movie voice: “Sooner or later, will we all be doing the dark bidding of your mind?”
“He’s not sure. He wants to run some tests.”
“Why does that sentence strike more fear into my heart every time I hear it?”
~
Peter celebrated not having died by rolling into bed and falling into a deep, black sleep.
~
“You felt she was in danger,” Walter said. “You didn’t just feel that danger, you saw that danger.”
Peter paused, processing. “You were the danger,” he said. Which is why Walter had been thrown halfway across the room by his brain. 
“Yes! Exactly!” Walter was smiling. Peter couldn’t remember ever seeing someone so happy to have been someone else’s nightmare.
~
“Ah!” Walter crowed, clasping his hands to his chest and bouncing on his heels. Clearly he had been waiting for Peter to ask. “That’s the best part, son!” He looked around the room. “This calls for some hot cocoa!”
“Walter,” Peter said, a warning word with a rise at the end, but it was absolutely useless as Walter was already out the door and tip-toeing down the stairs, singing a song wherein the only word was ‘marshmallows’.
~
“Astrix, you’re a welder,” he sighed reverently.
She was slipping her mask off, watching Walter creep around the tables to look at her work. “Don’t touch it Walter, it’s hot.”
But it was the torch he wanted. “Will you teach me?” he asked her.
“There is nothing that would keep me awake at night quite like that,” Peter called across the lab.
“...and I remember a poster; there was a woman,” Walter said. He curled his arm up, making a muscle. “We can do it!” he said, and held his pose for a moment. “That’s what the poster said,” he told Astrid. “We can do it!”
“Rosie the Riveter?” Astrid asked, tapping it into her computer. The image came up immediately, and she angled the screen at Walter.
“Yes!” Walter said, shaking his fist. Astrid turned the screen back and continued to click and type. He blinked at her. “Astrid, do you think I could get one?”
“A poster?” She was already on Amazon. It was already in the shopping cart. It was the largest possible size; it would take up a good amount of the wallspace behind his desk. “I’ll see about that, Walter.”
Walter smiled inwardly. “Rosie the Riveter!” he whispered. He tipped his head back up to Astrid, who was entering the lab’s shipping address. “Astrix, I don’t suppose you are a riveter as well?”
“Not a chance,” she said. “Besides, I don’t think Peter will ever be cool with you having a rivet gun around the house.”
“Not happening, Walter,” Peter called.
Walter was looking like a fallen soufflé. “I think there’s a spot I missed,” Astrid said, studying the perfectly welded base. “Walter, you want to help?” He picked up her blowtorch with both hands. She almost took a step back, but he only handed it to her.
“We can do it!” he said, pushing up his sleeves. She had to smile.
~
“We have dried mangoes or rainbow Goldfish. If you want the Goldfish, be aware that Walter’s probably picked out all the purple ones,” he said. She looked mildly disappointed.
~
“Walter made Baked Alaska.” His eyes narrowed, like he was recalling a terrible humiliation.
“How’d that turn out?” 
“I wouldn’t know; I left when Walter said he was making Baked Alaska.”
~ “I should go back,” she said, and he knew she meant to her apartment. It was half-hearted and it was a question despite the way she phrased it. She just never felt right saying ‘maybe.’
“And crush Walter’s fragile spirit?” Peter said.
~
“Peter, if you’re—” she cut herself short. She didn’t want to accuse him. 
“What? Lying to keep you here?” he said. He didn’t look too hurt; he was a realist. He scruffed the back of his neck and sighed. “I won’t say that I wouldn’t do that in general because I think we both know I would. But I would call it bluffing; it sounds better that way.”
~ Walter had a moment of grief over his breakfast plate when Peter told them why they were going.
“I had a great fondness for that projector,” he said quietly, looking through his raisin toast while his forehead creased with worry. “Peter,” he said, and Peter thought he might hear a story that would remind him why he felt so nostalgic about that big black hunk of perforated metal. But all Walter said was, “I think we may be out of apple butter.” Which would have been useful in itself, except that Peter only had to reach into the cabinet to produce one of the eight (eight, Walter!) jars that Walter had insisted he buy on their last trip to the store.
~ Peter set an alarm on his cell phone and put it into Walter’s pocket. “When this alarm goes off, meet us by the Van de Graaff,” Peter said. “If you need me, press two to call Olivia’s phone.”
“Yes, son,” Walter said. “Go enjoy your date.”
“Walter...” Peter decided not to bother with protest. “Just don’t set anything on fire.”
“Certainly not on purpose,” Walter said as he wandered off.
[…] “Oh, Peter,” Walter said when he saw them, “Thank goodness you’re here. Someone is trying desperately to get in touch with you.” He pulled Peter’s phone out of his pocket and handed it through the window. Alarm! was still flashing on the front panel. Peter could only shake his head and turn it off.
~
He glanced at Olivia with a pained little smile. She gave him a wide one in return that clearly indicated that her interest was proportional to his uneasiness.
~ “Peter was so bright,” Walter said. His face turned wistful. “He figured out the security codes so quickly, and then it became impossible to find him when he escaped.”
~
“Excellent. I very much enjoy their snack aisle,” Walter said. “So much transparent packaging.”
“Walter?” Peter said. “You gamble? For money?”
“Of course not,” Walter said. “I am an excellent dealer.” He looked back at his son with a bright smile. “I wear a visor!” Peter tilted his head like a baffled dog.
“You should see him at pub trivia,” Astrid said. “He cleans up. We have free beer at the Purple Shamrock ‘til March,” Jane chimed in.
~ His eyes started to focus again, and the thought crossed his mind that he wasn’t in the chair. No, he was definitely not in the chair. He was on a gurney. He was...shirtless? And everyone was huddled over him. The look on Olivia’s face... The look on Walter’s. Peter was confused.
Astrid foresaw his attempt to get up and she held him down with an iron palm, that-when it touched his sternum-felt like the business end of a branding iron.
~ “How about, ‘Thank god for you, Olivia, because if we waited for Peter to identify his own advances we’d think none of this had ever worked?’” she suggested.
“More like, ‘Diseases involve complex processes interacting in a delicate imbalance within the body and cannot simply be cured in a moment’s time.’” He said it in a reasonable approximation of Walter’s voice and Olivia wanted to smile but this was an argument, dammit, and she didn’t smile during arguments. Also, that really didn’t sound like anything Walter would say.
“You can’t be serious,” she said, following him down the hall in her bare feet and t-shirt. “Are we both talking about the man who believed in sentient viruses?”
“Believes,” Peter said. “Believes in sentient viruses. And the tooth fairy.”
[…]”Diseases involve complex processes interacting in a delicate imbalance within the body,” Walter said, and Peter looked so fucking triumphant that if she hadn’t been driving she would have punched his arm. “But that which Olivia is suggesting is not beyond the realm of possibility.” Olivia watched the road serenely. She wanted to whip her head to the side and give him an open-mouthed expression of victory, but she was a better person than that. Absolutely a better person.
~ “Sorry,” Astrid says, genuine remorse on her face as she rears back with her fist. Peter’s seeing this, seeing how her whole body is feeding the momentum of her wrist, but he’s seeing her innocent, heart-shaped face and thinking no, no way, not possible even as she socks him in the jaw.
~ “Olivia Dunham, I’m not sure if you understand what a momentous occasion this is,” he said. “I’m about to buy something. Which I will then own. Meaning that after tonight I will have a very large possession that I can’t easily move.” She looked at him blankly. “And I’ll let you figure out why that’s significant,” he finished. There was an accordion door at the end of the hall. He pushed it aside and they stepped through into a bright, warm room with a rippled ceiling. It was filled with pianos.
“Oh,” Olivia said.
~
“What are you looking for?” she asked him on the third piano.
“I’ll know when I find it,” he replied, unnecessarily cryptic.
~ Peter had ways of dealing with stressful situations. His most effective was to think to himself: I am the smartest person in the room. It calmed him to believe that he would see danger before it became dangerous, and that he would have the ingenuity to build himself an exit door if he found himself trapped. It wasn’t working well for him now, because this stressful situation had nothing to do with intelligence nor escapes.
~ There was no way Olivia could have missed the fact that it was Halloween. There were bats hanging from the ceiling that looked less like the plastic versions she’d envisioned when she told Walter he could hang bats from the ceiling and more like half-bald specimens from the zoology department. Walter had spent the day head-to-toe in flannel and denim, which probably had a lot to do with why Gene was painted blue. Astrid had put her foot down when she saw him tying two-pound slabs of bacon to his bare feet.
“First of all,” she’d said, “I don’t know who bought you slabs of bacon—” she’d glared at Peter, who’d mouthed not me but was probably lying “—but you are not skating around this lab on those because I don’t think you even know where we keep the mop bucket. Second of all, you know it wasn’t Paul Bunyan that skated around the giant frying pan, right?”
~ “Boo,” he said, tugging gently at her fingertips before releasing. “I assume the costume I haven’t seen you working on is stashed away somewhere to up the surprise factor?”
~ “You can’t borrow a toothbrush.” She paused. “Do you borrow my toothbrush?” she demanded. He held his hands in front of him and tried to look disarmingly charming.
~
“Certainly not the entire act. I’ve found that even a highly aroused partner is quite capable of inflicting many varieties of—”
“Skip it,” Peter ordered, and Walter complied immediately, as if the needle on the record player in his mind had been lifted and dropped somewhere else.
~ “This is all well and good, Peter, but last time I checked I wasn’t made of Boo Berries,” Olivia said, waving at his cereal demonstration. Sometimes he thought she said these things just to be ornery.
“Right, which is why none of this is literally what happened to us,” Peter said. “But Walter’s idea of what did happen to us comes from these resonance structures.”
“Imagine,” Walter cut in, “that you, Olivia, are viewing an autostereogram.” Olivia looked at Peter flatly.
“A Magic Eye,” Peter said. “Those things where you stare at a weird pattern until you see something in 3D.”
“Right, okay,” Olivia said. “In the future, Walter, feel free to just say Magic Eye.”
“Imagine,” Walter continued as if neither of them had said anything, “that you knew how to see the three-dimensional image. Now imagine you’ve learned to see the image with its depth inverted by focusing in a slightly different way. This would enable you to cycle back and forth between seeing the image and its inverse.”
~ Walter appeared only once, groggily shuffling in and asking about the earthquake. Peter said something with a lot of numbers and coordinates and the number 9.8, and Olivia looked at him punishingly but he shrugged as Walter wandered back downstairs.
“Hey, he’s not even gonna remember that in the morning,” Peter said, “and I figure if I have to live with him, I get to have fun with him.”
~ “Couch.” He didn’t say what he was going to do because then she could say why she was refusing. “Sit,” he said, and when she balked he just waited silently until she did it. He’d figured out that he could win some arguments by not arguing, and the counter-intuitiveness of that delighted him.
~
“Hey,” he said, “Walter found something he’s calling a venomous urostyle, and I thought you might want to watch him painfully try to explain what that means to the rent-a-cops.”
~
“If I were something Walter used every day, where would I be?” He looked around the room like something might start glowing.
“That’s almost too easy,” she said. Peter kept waiting for an intervention, but Olivia went straight to Gene’s pen and started prodding the hay with her shoe until she hit something. She dug her hand in cautiously and brought out a short stack of leather-bound notebooks. Brushing the hay dust off the covers revealed several large stains of indeterminate origin. “These what you’re looking for?”
“Seriously?” Peter said as she handed him the books.
“It was almost too easy.” Olivia eyed the hay. “Now I’m kind of wondering what I’d find if I kept looking.”
“Don’t, though,” he said. “At least this was toward the front of the cow.”
~
He skimmed it while she waited. Walter’s handwriting was 4-point at best and for all she could tell he wrote backwards. There were occasional sketches of equipment and wirings, with printouts and graphs taped wherever he could fit them.
“You plan to read that?” she said. “You know, if you wanted to be punished, you could have just told me. I have handcuffs. And a can-do attitude, according to my last review.”
~ “Lots of sentences ending in, ‘which was an opportunity for coitus, though it cannot be determined if coitus has occurred.’ Lots and lots of sentences. You’d think we were animals in his personal zoo.”
~ “Walter’s worried about you,” he said, as if she were ovbiously all right, as if nothing wrong had happened. “And he thinks you’re going to hate him.”
“I’m fine, Walter,” she said loudly through the door, and her voice wavered a little but it was the best she could ask for. “I don’t hate you.”
A relieved ‘excellent, thank you, very good,’ penetrated back.
~
“I forgot to mention,” he said as she worked her way up the front steps, “the union called.” He waited for to turn to him and repeat, ‘the union?’ with that sceptical look he liked so much. “Lab Rats Local 512. Tomorrow’s a mandatory holiday. Possibly also the day after tomorrow.”
“I received no notification.”
“Well. It’s not a very well organized union. Mostly rats, mice, us.” That made her smile for real. 
~ “And, hey, I plugged into Arpanet. I’m asking for help deciphering some glyphs, maybe working on the DNA. Anonymously, of course, but I think they’ll all know who ‘Count Spockula’ is. I’ll plug you in, too. If we can figure out...”
“Being held in military prison for several years for breaking into a government network will not be the best use of your genius,” Walter said quietly.
~ “Sorry,” he said. “I did tell him emergencies only.”
Olivia put a foot up on the dash. “Food usually is, with him.”
“I should’ve specified blood and/or gore.”
“You’d have to split hairs over ectoplasm.”
“And, crazily, even ectoplasm I think he could handle. It’s Walter vs. common household appliances that worries me. Toasters, microwaves.”
“Which brings us back to food.”
Peter thought about that. “Ugh,” he said, shaking his head. “It’s like leaving an eight-year-old home alone.”
“Maybe a thirteen-year-old. He does know how to order pay-per-view porn.”
Peter cringed. “Oh. Oh. Yeah...I was hoping you would never notice that.”
“He’s not so good about changing the channel afterwards,” Olivia said. “On the upside, you can’t get much more innocuous than girls on trampolines eating ice cream.”
“Oh, please can we not talk about it.” Olivia sat back in her seat with a small smile while Peter winced and tried to think about vector multiplication, Schrödinger equations, Taylor series, anything but girls on trampolines eating ice cream. It was difficult, though; he knew his father sat through it wondering what flavour the ice cream was.
~ As they walked the parking lot toward the diner’s doors, Peter’s phone buzzed again. He didn’t bother to check the ID, just opened it and asked, “Is something on fire?” Then, “Will something be on fire in the next five minutes?” Then, “Walter, tell me you didn’t call to tell me that.” He rolled his eyes at Olivia, lagging behind him. “I’ll tell her.” She frowned at him. “I said I’d tell her. And for the record, Walter, this is also not an emergency.” He hung up.
“Apparently,” he sighed, “it will be a crime against man and nature if you don’t order the jalapeno grilled cheese.”
“Only me? What about you?”
“Lost cause. Walter and I are diner incompatible.”
~
“I should bring you in on destruction of government property.”
He concentrated, his hand working with something she couldn’t see. For a second she saw him arm-deep in the Walternator, removing the magic piece. “I don’t think our phones cost Uncle Sam more than $100,” he said. “Misdemeanour all the way.”
“Another one for your collection.”
“It’s a comprehensive collection.” He wrested a small, taped-up parcel from the inside of the rear bumper. “There we go,” he said. He held it up. It was clearly homemade, a true Walter Bishop artefact, complete with Christmas stickers that had come in their junk mail. “I’ll bet a lot of people would be more worried to find something like this stuck under their car.”
“Well, you can’t ditch it here,” she said. She jerked her head slightly toward the parents on the playground, who were now intently watching Peter - in his black coat and sunglasses - handle what looked like a bomb he’d pulled from under his black, government-plated SUV.
“Oh, great,” he said.
“You think it would worry them more or less if I flashed my badge?”
~
“You’re not dying; you’re just drowning in your own wasted potential.”
~ “You’re assuming I want to eat it at all.”
“Peter!” Walter interrupted, calling from upstairs. “Peter!”
“Oh, Jesus,” Peter said. “Not again.”
“Peter!” Walter called again, this time over the thunder of his winter boots down the steps. “Maybe while the cookies are-”
“No,” Peter said. He thumped the dough flat against the butcher block. “No more. Two days of tree-hunting is my limit.”
“But we haven’t tried every place,” Walter pleaded, clumping into the kitchen, thick with outerwear.
“I think, Walter,” Peter said, “that freezing my ass off in three different fields of hundreds - hundreds - of trees while you wandered around for hours and chose none of them is sufficient participation on my part. I’m not actually convinced there’s a tree out there that would please you, besides that fifteen-footer the Boy Scouts had - and we’ve already had that discussion.”
Walter puffed up like a poked alligator. “Selectivity is nature’s sieve,” he muttered, looping a scarf around his neck.
“Walter,” Peter warned. “You don’t look like a man who’s accepted that he’s not going tree-hunting.”
“Perhaps because I am, indeed, going tree-hunting. I don’t need a chaperone,” he snorted.
“I assume, then, that you’ll be carrying the tree home?” Peter asked. “Or would you prefer to drag it? I’ll bet I could find you a nice tow-rope in the basement.”
“I thought I might take the car,” Walter ventured, tapping the counter with hopeful fingers already snug in their driving gloves.
“That’s funny,” Peter said, “because I thought that the operation of motor vehicles was limited to those with a valid Massachusetts license. All in possession, raise a hand.” Olivia’s floury left rose obediently with Peter’s, although she glanced at Walter with casual regret for participating. “Sorry, Walter,” Peter said. “Maybe next Christmas.”
~
“Great,” he said, shaking the blush off his face like an Etch-a-Sketch. “That’s great. X-chromosomes are Satan’s Darwinism,” he griped
~ “For an old man, your father has amazing stamina,” Astrid whispered to Peter, as he hid the hard-won broom out of sight on top of the kitchen cabinets.
“Let’s not use the word ‘stamina’ while I’m touching the giant phallic symbol, yeah?” Peter shot back.
~ So, the dress. It was red and shiny and sparkled like a franchise vampire: Rachel’s style, not hers, a gift from a concerned sister. It showed an uneasy amount of thigh and made her play a zero-sum game with her hems: bottom down, top up - she could go on all night.
~ “I need you to get Nina on a line. I need to ask her something.” Nina was on in seconds. “This might be a personal question,” Peter said, and paused. Broyles glanced around the circle of agents, and the headsets peeled off in unison. 
~
When the bartender notices him she makes her way over with a smile. Charlie’s first instinct is to blurt out: “Please bear my children.” but he doesn’t think that’ll go over very well so he begins with the safer: “Hi, I’m Charlie.”
~
Charlie’s so happy his partner has to constantly remind him to stop looking like an idiot. (“Yeah, you’re in love, we get it, I was there when it happened. Now stop smiling like a moron or the perps will never take you seriously.”)
~ “Come on, this isn’t getting us anywhere,” he said, desperate. “This guy is the most boring guy in the history of boring people.”  “He’s on the list,” Olivia protested.
~
“Are you finished?” Olivia asked exasperatedly.  “Yeah,” Peter said, and sunk down into his seat. “Except now I really want some pie.”
~ “Oh, for—” Emerson rolled his eyes. “Why don’t you just tell us why you’re really here? I know it ain’t the pie.”  “Actually,” Peter said, raising his pie filled fork, “that’s why I’m here.”  Emerson watched him for a moment. “Okay, I’ll buy that,” he said, before turning to Olivia. “So why are you here?”
~
“He doesn’t even believe in ghosts,” Chuck confided. “Can you believe that? Who doesn’t believe in ghosts?”  “I don’t believe in ghosts,” Peter said helpfully.
~
“So do you think you can give me a ride to the hospital?” he asks. He pulls his hand away from where it was struggling to hold his insides in. Her eyes widen horribly. “Don’t freak out: I don’t think it hit anything.”
“You don’t think it hit anything? It hit you!”
~
White grabbed Tony, pulling him up against him and placing the gun at his temple. “Surrender, 452, or your boyfriend here is dead.” “Is this some new FBI procedure?” Gibbs hissed, his own weapon aimed at White now. Kate followed suit. “You don’t want to get involved in this,” White said darkly. “She could kill you in an instant.” “Oddly enough,” Gibbs said, casting Max a quick wary glance, “it’s not her I’m worried about at the moment. Let him go.”
~
Like so many things are, it’s Eames’ fault. He’s the one who finds the job, who drags Cobb out of semi-retirement with the promise of an easy way to fill the children’s college fund. He’s the one who shows up on Arthur’s doorstep one night after seven months of radio silence and smirks his way through a job offer. And he’s the one standing in front of the whiteboard now, outlining the plan in squeaky blue marker and grinning like he hasn’t just said the stupidest thing in the history of the universe. “Is this a joke?” Arthur finally manages. “Not at all,” Eames says, still smiling winningly. Arthur turns to Cobb. “Seriously, are you kidding?” Cobb, to his credit, at least looks a little sheepish.
~
(It’s amazing how useless most commercial burglar alarms are. If it weren’t so helpful for Arthur’s particular line of work, he’d be tempted to write a letter to Consumer Affairs.)
~
Cobb answers, probably because Eames is still too busy feigning shock over Arthur’s display of rationality and common sense.
~ Eames just grins. “I’ve even got rope in my utility belt.” And he does, the infuriatingly competent bastard.
~
Because Cobb is Arthur’s oldest and dearest friend, he doesn’t say: “I told you so.” He does say: “Stop breathing so heavily. You sound like an obscene phone caller.”
~
“So,” Cobb says, passing Arthur a hydrospanner to pass to Chewie. “Eames, huh?” “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” “Sure,” Cobb says. Then, a minute later, “But Eames?” Arthur throws the hydrospanner at him, whatever the hell that even is.
~
“Can I help you?” Arthur asks, only because he’s marginally too polite to just say ‘Move’.
~
“The winning entrant gets his picture on the wall behind the counter!” Eames sounds genuinely excited, and Arthur can’t tell if he’s fucking with him or being serious. Eames, Arthur has noticed, is annoyingly difficult to read. “Sure,” Arthur says, flat, because he’s learned the hard way that with people like Eames, ‘just fucking with you’ is always the safest assumption.
~ “Isn’t that a little, uh—” “Old fashioned?” Arthur was thinking more along the lines of “sexist,” but he nods anyway.
~ Yusuf is no help at disciplining him, and every time Arthur emails Eames he just gets links to inappropriate websites or pictures of LOLcats in reply. So Arthur tracks him down. It’s not hard—Yusuf has all his information, and apparently no compunctions about handing it out to anyone who asks.
~ Arthur dives right in: “You can’t just write a list of all your favourite foods. That’s not journalism, ok? That’s a list.” “It’s not a list,” Eames says, “it’s an impassioned defence of England’s culinary honour.” Arthur reaches into his bag and digs out a copy of Eames’ article. He holds it up in front of Eames and points to the third paragraph, which is, in fact, a list of all of Eames’ favourite foods. “Well,” Eames amends, “it’s not entirely a list.”
~
“Holy shit!” she says. “You have a crush, that’s so adorable!” 
He doesn’t and it’s not, and he says as much. He adds a “fuck off” for good measure.
~ Ariadne drags him out on Halloween. She says it’s almost her birthday (her birthday’s in December), and anyway, he can’t stay in on Halloween, especially when it’s on a Friday night. He tries to get out of it by simply not buying a costume, operating under the naïve assumption that Ariadne would be deterred by his lack of preparation.
~ “My game,” Eames repeats, slowly, incredulous, “where I send you presents to find out more about you?” “Yes. All the clothes, and the books you knew I’d like and the theatre tickets you knew I’d want and the phone calls.” He stops, forces his voice to even out. “You’ve been trying to—I don’t know, provoke me into a reaction. Figure me out,” he finishes lamely.  There’s a long stretch of painful silence while Eames just stares at him. “Darling,” he says finally, “I’m starting to think a whole bloody team of psychiatrists couldn’t ‘figure you out.’ I sent you things I liked that I thought you might like. You are familiar with the concept of a present, aren’t you? I’ve been trying to get to know you, yes, but it’s not some kind of nefarious plot or. . .whatever strange sort of game you’ve built up in your head. I like you. Is that really so incomprehensible?” In some distant part of his brain, Arthur is vaguely aware that Eames has just made some very important statements with real and meaningful implications for all of their future interactions. In that same distant part of his brain, Arthur is frantically re-visiting the past few years’ worth of gifts and calls and flirtations and innuendos, cursing himself for being such a complete fucking moron and wondering how he could have misread everything so thoroughly. The rest of his brain, however, is entirely occupied with one single thought: “So. . .you actually like Russian Futurist poetry?” And that’s probably the absolute last thing he should be thinking about at the moment, but Arthur can’t help it, because it is also the single hottest thing he has ever heard in the history of ever.
~ “Leggo, I’m okay.” To prove his point, he folded his legs under himself, then pushed up. And promptly sank down again as his weakened body refused to hold him. Sam was giving him that bratty ‘I told you so’ look that hadn’t changed one bit since he was four. Dean would’ve considered wiping it off his face if he hadn’t needed all his concentration to not fall over. 
~
“Er. Sorry. I’ll fix it. I can fix it. …Well, Clark can probably fix it.”
~
Tim and Kon look at one another in panic. “He made me do it,” they say at the same time, and then, “Hey! Traitor!”
~
“Shall we go into town and be rubbish together, then?”
“Excellent plan. I will put the kettle on.”
~
“How the fuck is the Department of Defence so easy to break into!? Their logo has swords instead of laurel wreaths!”
~
“Of course you can do it. Once, when you were a boy, you blew up a toaster oven with your mind simply because of an irrational hatred of raisin toast.”
“Have you ever had raisin toast?”
~ “What do we want?”
“TIME TRAVEL.”
“When do we want it?”
“IRRELEVANT!”
~
“Yep. The coffee is hot and black. I’ll give it to you if you promise not to throw it at me.”
Gibbs glared.
Dean shrugged. “Suit yourself.” He made himself comfortable in the bed out of arms’ reach and drank the coffee himself.
~
“It’s complicated,” Neal supplied helpfully.  Arthur smacked the side of his head lightly. “You have a son?” Cobb said, his voice low and a little incredulous. “Wait, you two are together?” said the young woman. “I thought you were leaving him in Mombassa,” Yusuf murmured to Eames. “It’s complicated,” Neal repeated gleefully.
~ 
“He is not tracking me!” Neal squawked, insulted. “We are in a slow dance of wit and cunning and sometimes I give him little leads to follow because he’s cute when he thinks he’s onto something.” “You’re full of shit,” Eames said flatly. “And if you keep this up you’re going to get caught.”
~
I lean forward and press my lips to her forehead. “I think that you may just have a fever,” I whisper against her warm skin. “A fever? You feel confident in making that diagnosis with this very scientific method, do you?” “I was at MIT... and... I’m very confident in saying that I think that you’re really hot,” I counter with a smile, unable to help myself.
~
“Tell me if she was happy at least,” Peter demands. “She is alive,” September replies. “That’s not what I asked.”
“She was happy when she thought about you,” September says unexpectedly. “And she thought about you every day.”
~
“King wants to see you,” he said.  “The king, or someone named King, or —?” the Doctor began, but Jasper stepped on his foot pointedly as he passed.
~
“Sorry, I was unavoidably unconscious. You’re a clever sentient species, why couldn’t you get the doors open yourselves?” “I don’t know if you’ve noticed but all the technology on this planet is designed for opposable thumbs, which I do not have,” Gene pointed out.
~
“Oook at his wee feetsies,” Mel said, then looked suitably embarrassed.
~
“What do you mean, there’s a camel outside?” someone said in the house. “Whose camel?”
~
It glared at her. “We have caused you no harm as yet.” “And I haven’t shot you yet,” she replied.
~
“Does ‘work something out’ mean ‘shoot them in the face’?” Neal looked at Dean and received a smile in return. “Doesn’t it always?”
~
“How did you get my file?” James asked, feeling more than a little pissed. They had no right. “Those records are classified!”
“I have a lot of friends,” Wolf told him and the man with the binoculars-Eagle-snorted in amusement.
“You have one friend,” he said. “And he told you to stop calling for favours.”
~ “Astrid, would telepathic apples go under mind control or genetic engineering?”
“Let me see. No irregularities in the gene sequencing of the apples. It’s really more of a mass hallucination. Chemical applications and experiments,” Walter said decisively. 
“We’re going to have to sub-divide that category eventually. It’s going to topple over,” she said. “Animal, mineral, or vegetable. That should be by far the easiest,” Walter said, and put the telepathic apple file off to one side.
“Alligator man?”
“Genetic experimentation,” Astrid pointed. “Car turned inside out?”
“Space-time continuum errors.” She waved at the stack behind the couch. “Live Roman warrior found in 1978 by Liverpool?”
“Time travel.” Peter heaved the file by Olivia’s foot at Astrid’s direction.
“Hive mind?”
“Psychics, right in the middle,” Olivia said, tapping for Peter to put the file down right on top of the one with her own name on the tab. 
~
“You keep running, you’ll only go to jail tired!” Hank yelled ahead. The suspect ignored him, darting down a side street.
~
“Oh it’s you,” says the man opening the door to the second floor flat, sounding as unimpressed with Eames as Arthur currently feels. Arthur likes him immediately.
~ Sherlock bursts through the door, looking triumphant. Eames comes in after him, face a set line, and Arthur sits up straight. Beside him, John’s doing the same. “We were shot at!” Sherlock says. “It was marvellous!”
~ “I’m coming with you,” John says. “Why?” Sherlock whines. “You’ll stop me from doing anything fun.” “Exactly,” John says, and gets his coat. Arthur, not for the first time, wonders what the fuck he’s getting into.
~
“Hey,” Ariadne’s saying, and Arthur looks over to find her with her hands on her hips, looking like she wants to hit John instead. “You won’t stop me because I’m a girl?” “Do you have military training?” John says. “No,” she says. “I only protect Sherlock from grievous injury,” John says, and turns the page. “Everything else he deserves.” Sherlock lets out an exceedingly offended huff.
~ “I’m going to ignore the fact you just implicitly threatened me, but only because your arms are the size of my head,” Sherlock says, as if granting a favour, and lets him inside.
~ “Sherlock,” Arthur says, in the same tone people generally say ‘Genocide’ or ‘Hitler’ or ‘Marmite’. “Of course.”
~ The text read: If you stopped visiting us, nothing like this would happen. We would all be happier. Please never return. Sherlock Holmes.
~
“Sorry, Jonathan,” Rick said. “And you’d better get used to it. A man’s got to side with his wife, even over his brother-in-law.” Evy’s eyes widened and her hand tightened on Rick’s forearm. Jonathan made an odd choking noise while Rick blinked.
‘Wife?’ she thought. “Wife?” she asked out loud.
Rick looked at her with a wince. “Yeah. I’m supposed to actually ask you, aren’t I?”
~
“Yeah, you know,” Rick made a gesture with his hands. “Get hitched. Tie the knot. Take the plunge. The old ball and chain—”
“Stop!” Evy held up her hands. “Stop talking.” She breathed deeply, trying to remember that she did actually care about the man standing in front of her and the fact that he was talking nonsense was proof that he cared for her, too and was simply incapable of expressing himself rationally.
~ “I’ll marry you,” She lifted her chin. “But I won’t stop my research.”
“I—didn’t know you had to,” he said his brow furrowing. 
~
He looked up at the ceiling in supplication. “You’re like this Sirocco that has just blown into my life and instead of covering me with sand and getting grit in my eyes, you’ve just…made me…want all this stuff I’ve never wanted before and, yeah, I want to marry you. I want to see where you’re going to next and I want to be with you when you get there.”
Evy couldn’t breathe. She felt as though someone had just opened that tiny safe in her heart that had always hoped for a love and a partnership as strong as her parents’. Her voice was not as strong as she would have wished as she said, “You do realize you just compared me to a rather destructive weather phenomenon?”
“Yeah, well, I’m not good with words,” Rick said rolling his eyes.
~
“You owe money to a guy nicknamed Big Eddie?”
“No, I owe money to a guy named Big Eddie. He had it legally changed.”
~
“Although, I was referring to his lesser-known masterwork, the Kip Brothers, in which he posited that the last image seen in life, right at the moment of death, is permanently imprinted on the retina of the eye.”
“Also a work of fiction, which is a small but critical distinction.”
~ “I pretty much knew that this was what I wanted to do by the time I was nine.”
“When I was nine years old, I think I wanted to be a brontosaurus.”
~ They watched Walter in the video tape say, “I am Doctor Walter Bishop and this is Test Subject Number Six.”
“What happened to subjects one through five,” asked Peter.
“I believe the university settled with them out of court,” Walter responded, avoiding eye contact. “They probably never had to work again…not that they could.”
~ “You ever play that game Operation? It’s like that, except in reverse. You have to put those batteries into my chest. But whatever you do, don’t touch the nerve endings.”
“And what if I do?”
“Don’t.”
~ “He is a little short for her, but not when you stand him on his money.”
~ “I’m just resting my eyes.”
“Right. Otherwise known as sleeping?”
~
“Nope. I’m still asleep upstairs in my bed. You’re just talking to an astral projection of me.”
“You’re just saying that to see if I’m high.”
~ “Ok, Lloyd, you know this guy, I want you front and centre on the case.”
“Actually, I was hoping for of like a back and off to the side position, Charlie. This guy hates me. And not like you hate me; he hates me hates me.”
~ “I mean, why would anyone in their right mind leave Dallas for Southern California? We’ve got the same weather without the liberals.”
~ “Is there beer in that bag?”
Peter did his best to look wounded. “Is there beer in the bag,” he mocked.  
~
“What’s the difference between flowers and a car? A few zeroes, that’s all. You don’t give back gifts. I raised you to be polite.”
~ He can tell by the way she’s holding her shoulders that she’s coming to the decision to kick the door down; the man in the pea-coat can tell, too, Dean thinks, because he’s got this amused twinkle to his eyes that suggests he’ll enjoy watching her do it.
~ “Being invisible is pointless if you can tell I’m here.” Natalie pouted.
~ “Please tell me you didn’t mail that prehistoric frog to my apartment in an attempt to kill my roommate.” Lincoln growled into his headset. 
~
“I’m not touching that pregnancy test! You peed on it.”
“I have to do that so the test will work.”
“If the test is to see if I’ll touch something you just peed on, then it’s negative.”
~ “Just remember, you’re not there to talk or ask questions. You’re thereto look scary and imposing.” The human then eyed his bright red and blue armour. “Well, as scary and imposing as someone can be in that costume.”
“What’s wrong with my armour?” Superman asked, almost offended. 
“It’s a little, uh, cheery,” Gordon replied. “This is Gotham son, it takes a little more than an alien origin story to shake people up. Come on.”
~ “Look, Jim,” Wayne said and Superman instantly knew that he had no idea what was going on. He sounded much too carefree. “If this is about that creepy horse statue in Gateway Park, I’ll just pay for the damages.” Gordon looked at the man as if he had grown another head.
“I have no idea what that means,” the Commissioner said and he sounded as if he was scolding his own son.
“Oh,” he said. “Then way did I get arrested?”
“They didn’t tell you?”	
“They probably did,” Wayne replied with a shrug. “I wasn’t really listening.”
~ “Can I at least get some coffee?” Wayne shouted after them as the door closed. Nobody bothered to answer him.
~ The Doctor is trying for nonchalant, and missing by a mile.
~ “Why do bad guys always pick abandoned warehouses? You’d think it was part of their genetic make-up or something. You know, do evil, automatically find a warehouse to hole up in after.”
“Sometimes it’s sewers,” Max offers.
“Or toxic waste dumps,” Terry puts in.
“Abandoned chemical factories,” Bruce says.
“Remind me to never ask you guys what you do with your days off,” Matt says.
~ “Are you sure you should be drinking that? You’re what, sixteen? I think it’s supposed stunt your—whoa, hey, I guess not,” he finishes when Matt hunches protectively over his cup and growls.
~ “Here you go,” but she stops before she puts the plate down in front of him. “You allergic to anything?”
“Raisins?” Diaz says tentatively.
Max looks at the plate. “Yeah, I think you’ll be okay.”
~ “I’d tell you you’re a real jerk,” Flash says, “but they’d never find my body. So I won’t.”
~ Max is reading around Bruce’s shoulder. She says, “Is that what I think it is?”
“I don’t know,” Bruce says. “Do you think it’s the baseline operating code for dimensionally shifted alien technology?”
“Um, yes?”
“Then yes.”
“Cool,” Max says. “You gentlemen take a load off,” she says, already on her way out of the room. “I’ve got this.”
“You know what really sucks?” Matt says, “She probably does.”
~ “I know you,” she said, tilting her head and peering at Paco. “I held you hostage once, right?”
“It was magical,” Paco agreed, “but can we catch up after you’ve cut us down?”
~ “I can stay with him,” Paco said. “You can take the stuff to Jaime.”
“If Blue Beetle says that stuff is imperative, then it probably is,” Red Robin said. “I’ll take you the rest of the way.”
Brenda’s eyes lit up. “Wait. I get to ride with you? In the Batmobile?”
“We’ll be taking the plane, actually,” Red Robin said. Brenda punched the air.
“Is it too late to switch?” Paco asked.
~ “What’d she say?” he asked.
“Eh,” Paco replied. “The usual. Something something huge robots, something something magic guy, something something dimensional portal. So she’s thinking another two hours, tops.”
~ Apparently Thor was used to beer with actual grains in it and not high fructose corn syrup. Names were called, beer cans were thrown.
~ So three weeks later, Nick Fury started asking inconvenient questions like who told Thor about endorsement deals, and where do people from Asgard pay taxes anyhow. But the subway ads had already gone up, so what was he going to do? Complain about the good publicity?
~ The fan-mail makes her feel good about herself and the hate-mail makes her feel better about what she’s doing.
~ “Daniel, you have been coaching my son. You have been tutoring him in sports. That father-son bonding ritual that has been passed down through the generations has been interrupted. And it was done without telling me. Without even mentioning it to me. You have usurped my position and taken over my parental duties. Are you insulting my parenting skills?” Casey started glaring again. “Hold on, we’ve totally got off track here, I will come back to the calling me a crap father thing, what’s important is the coaching.”
“Casey, I think the issue we have in calling it coaching is that to do so would imply that what Charlie, and you know how dearly I love your son, right? Well, if we call it coaching, that firmly implies what he has been doing is a sport. And I think if nothing else, we can both agree it’s not.”
“How is it not a sport? There are balls and hoops and two teams and, and other stuff,” Casey said, arms folded over his chest.
Dan smirked. “The ‘other stuff’ to which you refer is broomsticks, Casey, broomsticks and silly hats and a fictional sport. Your son wants to be a professional Quidditch player, and I think we both know that’s your influence right there.”
“I’m only not punching you in the mouth because I know you do have his best interests at heart.”
“Interests like getting him laid before he hits forty,” Dan interrupted. “I can’t believe it’s a college sport. One hundred teams in the last one, over 2,000 people playing with broomsticks. And they had some serious representation there, Harvard, Texas A&M, UCLA. These are kids who could be playing football or rowing crew or just you know, having lots of sex and smoking pot. Instead they are playing a fictional game. I despair of the youth of today, Casey, I really do. And you’ve raised a kid who plays this game. I told you teaching him to read would lead to trouble. Also you have no idea how I’ve suffered for this. Did you know there are over 7,000 official rules? Rules which I have had to learn so I can advise your son on how best to proceed if he is knocked off his broom before completing a snitch snatch. Also, if you ever make me say ‘snitch snatch’ again I will make you regret it.”
 ~
“Yup, the school is using house elves as umpires or referees or grand high adjudicators or whatever they’re called.” Dan wasn’t really doing all that good a job of containing his glee at this point as his grin widened.
“Well, that’s just ridiculous,” said Casey seriously.
“Now you see my point.”
“I mean, everyone knows that house elves aren’t real elves.”
“Seriously? You’re joking right now aren’t you? You know that there’s no such thing as real elves.” Danny looked concerned. “I mean, I know you have some deep rooted feelings about Legolas, but still...”
“Legolas is a Mirkwood elf! He’s meant to be dark! Not this blond skinny thing!”
Dan put his head in his hands, “Seriously man, I thought we’d been through this and you were past it.”
 ~
Sam didn’t know what it was like to live without pain anymore, dealing with it on some level or another every waking hour for the past five years, so when it suddenly ceased, he had a hard time understanding what happened. One moment his vision was gone and his head felt like it was being crushed in a vice, and in the next, nothing but pain-free clarity. He could see again, he could breathe easy again, and the utter exhaustion that had been pulling him down for so long, was miraculously gone.
“Don’t get used to it,” the angel said quietly. “It’s only temporary.” He shrugged and gave Sam a small, wry smile. “I’m your bargain basement variety angel. I call for lightning and I get static cling. I call for healing, and I’m handed a box of Hello Kitty Band-Aids.”
~ “You look tired.”
Sam smiled wryly. “Subtle.”
Bobby shrugged. “Figured since I haven’t seen you for a while it’d be better than starting out ‘you look like death warmed over.’”

“Peggy wet herself. She’s supposed to use the toilet,” Trevor pointed out with the grave superiority of someone who clearly had a very selective memory of his own successes and failures in that department.

“Auror Department! On the ground, hands on your head!” Perfect. It was fucking perfect. Ricky jumped back, the look of guilty horror on the target’s face outlined for only an instant before he hit the pavement so hard that it seemed for a moment he’d been shot, hands clamped to the back of his head. Wand still leveled in one hand, Neville grabbed the target’s wrists with the other before he could change his mind. Not even a glance needed, and Ron had locked the cuffs in place, freeing him to frisk quickly for weapons, taking the wand from the back trouser pocket but leaving the various bottles and flasks of evidence where they were. They hadn’t made such a picture-perfect takedown since Auror training nine years back, but the smile abruptly dissolved off of Ron’s face into an expression of frustrated fury. “Shit, shit, shit!”
Neville’s hands tightened on the hilt of his wand, a thousand possibilities from an unseen weapon to having recognized the target as someone they’d rather not have it be spinning through his head. “What’s wrong?”
“I can’t remember the fucking Caution!”
Neville sighed in exasperation, digging in his pocket for the little card Ron was supposed to be carrying as well and, as the officer who had actually put the cuffs on, it was his duty to administer to their muttering target. “I’ve got it written down. Here.”
He tossed it over, and Ron caught it easily, tilting it to the light as he launched into the lengthy recitation. “It is my duty that you be made aware of your standing under the Provision of Magical Rights and Liberties. You have been apprehended by officers of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement while engaging in activities reasonably believed to be criminal in nature, and there is intent to hold you in violation of the law. Your wand has been—oh yeah.” He looked up curiously at Neville, who displayed the target’s wand, allowing Ron to continue with a dramatic clearing of the throat. “—confiscated and may not be returned to you unless you are exonerated of charges by the Wizengamot or equivalent legal due process. Officers of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement may use physical or magical force against you, including such as may cause permanent harm, injury, illness, incapacitation, or death if and only to the degree as is necessary to retain you in custody and to safeguard their own welfare as well as that of others. Any statement or incantation you may say or perform, including via non-verbal means may be used as evidence in a criminal proceeding...” Neville took the time to make a more thorough search of the target’s pockets. Two flasks like the one he’d found in Ricky’s apartment, two smaller vials, a small amount of pocket change, a half-crushed packet of B&H, a lighter, a pocket knife, and a wallet that identified him as Rodger Huntsman as well as giving an address only a few streets away that was potentially quite useful. “...You are considered to be innocent until such time as guilt is reasonably proven, however your apprehension in situ is considered temporary grounds upon which you have waived your right to liberty at this time. You have the right to refuse to answer questions, however any false or misleading answers given will result in additional criminal charges. If you believe yourself to be operating under a curse, hex, jinx, or otherwise engaging in your current activities under magical coercion, you may indicate as such at any time. Additional rights and exclusions under wizarding law will be explained to you fully and completely as relevant. Do you understand these rights and exclusions?”
Huntsman nodded miserably. “Yes.”
~
He didn’t get a chance to finish, his eyes flying wide and his mouth dropping into a pained, gagging wheeze of air as he doubled over the fist that had just been introduced forcefully to his midsection. Neville yanked the target away, glaring at his partner. “Ron!”
There was no trace of regret as Ron shook out his hand, shrugging innocently. “Incentive.”
“You’re not allowed to give that kind of incentive when they’re cooperating,” Neville retorted.
“I don’t feel very cooperated with, and I’m in a bad mood.” Ron shrugged again, circling around to crouch in front of Huntsman so that his face could be seen clearly from the doubled-over posture. “So. Please cooperate clearly enough that a thick bastard like me can see it, or I might have to give you another incentive.”
~ So long ago, Dean had categorized Ron and Harry’s fights into two forms: Nevermind-It’s-Already-Over and Oh-God-They’ll-Be-At-This-For-Months. Apparently, the distinction still held true, and Neville was relieved to see that it was the former as Ron’s face softened and he crossed the cramped office to lay an appeasing hand on the other man’s shoulder. “Harry, I’m sorry. I didn’t -”
~ This time, he almost didn’t win the struggle not to roll his eyes. “Have you been making and distributing anything else that could be considered illegal, whether you agree with that designation or not?”
~
Tony was the first to recover speech, shaking his head as he let out a low, slow whistle. “Hell hath no fury...”
“I don’t know if she believes in hell,” Neville pointed out, still a little dazed himself.”
“Doesn’t need to.” Tony lifted his mug as if in toast, nodding his head towards the door where she had made her dramatic exit. “She’s scarier.”
~ “I sit in Parliament. And on four committees. One of which I am endeavouring to maintain in a state of Not Bombing Us. I am running a household. A society household. I am managing my stables. I am a commissioned Flight Lieutenant in the RAF. I am an Auror working on a serial killer who is making their way through what is for all intents and purposes my sister’s family like a scythe, and I also happen to have another eensy little full time job on the side in the Wizengamot and as the leader of a political party here. And of course in the mean time my mother, God bless the darling tatted banshee, is trying to set me up with an assortment of women. There will be caffeine in unholy quantities if you want me to stay rational, there will be Ritalin, and Gin, and there will be not another word on it. Understood?”
~ “When’s the last time you had your piano tuned?”
“Ugh, you say that every time you play my piano.”
“Because it’s always out of tune.”
~ Among ballistics experts and firearms enthusiasts, though, the definition is a little different. Point blank is the range at which a given weapon/ammunition combination can be fired at the center or vital area of a given target and hit it without the shooter having to adjust the elevation of the weapon to account for the effect of gravity on the projectile’s trajectory.

“Oh, son, you know I’ve always loved younger men,” his mother said, breezily. “They’re the only ones who can keep up with me.” 
“I’m going to erase that image from my mind with a large glass of scotch. Can we please change the subject to something less likely to give me an ulcer?”
~
“I’m guessing she was thrilled that I know?”
“Smoke was pretty much exuding from her ears.”
~
“I was dirt. No, I was lower than dirt. What’s lower than dirt?”
“Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core…”
~ “As much as it pains me to interrupt your collegial banter, it pains me even more to listen to it.”
~ “Oh and if anyone runs across a ferret named Roy, do not touch him. Just let him die.”
~ “I’m guessing you took that off your resume in order to get a job here.”
“Well, what sort of hacker would I be if I couldn’t fix my own background check?”
~ He proposes with a card trick, and how can she refuse him, when he’s so very him, with the torn card and small diamond ring and dimple in his cheek?
~ “Somebody feed Gene yet?” he asks. She sincerely hopes Gene isn’t the cow. “Just about to,” Astrid says, holding up a sandwich. Yes, Gene is the cow.

“It’s difficult to do this. Hard to fin…like chasing a ghost through a house of mirrors.”
“How’d you learn how to do it?”
“I used to be the ghost.”
~ “Very friendly people here,” Lincoln says in her ear, his tone amused and approving. “Guy offered to blow me in the bathroom.”
~ “MORON!!” Walter hollers to no one in particular, slapping his forehead as he figures out the formula for cherry-pecan pie.  Broyles arrives in the exact same moment and freezes mid-step. Peter shrugs in explanation.
~
“He drugged me,” Lee moans into the phone. “Walter never drugs Astrid.” Myles is overly jaded against crime - where it’s a detriment rather than an aid to his career - but to Lincoln’s knowledge Myles’ never performed experiments on Lee’s personage without consent. “God, why did I get picked for this detail?” “Because you’re a weirdo,” Myles says without rancour.  Lincoln holds the phone away from his ear as if it’s personally affronted him. “I am not.”
~
“Balderdash,” Lee spits, as offensive as he can bring himself to be. The woman blinks, nonplussed, and turns away.
~ “You don’t exist,” Lee says decisively. “It’s misfiring neurons and too much electrical current. I am not going to end up in a padded cell beside Doctor Bishop at St. Claire’s because honestly, I’m good-looking, and weird things happen to good-looking guys in those places. Ergo, along with the random twitches and messed up vision, you too shall pass.”  The stranger smiles, his expression sardonic. “You sure you want to take that stance?”  Lincoln’s certain, until he spends the next eight hours fisting a pillowcase over his ears as the stranger bellows Row, Row, Row your Boat tunelessly, until Lincoln decides he’s not a hallucination but the spawn of the devil. “Oh god, enough already!”
~ Peter leans against the arm of the couch and shoots Nick a look of disbelief. “Really? Because she does a pretty damned good imitation of not liking me.”
“Her first impulse is to shoot things she doesn’t like. She hasn’t shot you yet.”
~ The gun disappears—under one of the pillows, Peter thinks, which is probably where it came from in the first place, since both Olivia and Nick have picked up the habit of squirreling weapons away in the damnedest places all over the house.
~ “You have insomnia?”
“Only when I try to sleep.”
~ “Are they very non-specific with their pronouns?”
~
“What’s the catch?”
“It’s pretty much a suicide mission.”
“Why should I trust you?”
“Because if I was lying to you, I wouldn’t have described it as a suicide mission.”
~ “So, she wanted to meet in the cemetery…that’s not foreboding at all.”
~ “It’s like giving a handgun to a six-year-old: you don’t know how it’s going to end, but you’re pretty sure it’s going to make the papers.”
~ “Without a decryption key, all you’ve got is an unusual looking paperweight.”
~ “Ok, say that again, but slower and dumber, please.”
“Ok, say you’re super evil and are looking for a way to move your blood money…”
~ “Why did we abort? You afraid they’ll interfere with the precision timing of your ‘crash the gate in a hail of bullets’ plan?”
~ “He left this for you,” Parker said, and handed him an envelope. It was still sealed; Eliot raised an eyebrow at her. “What does, ‘last year it snowed twice in the valley’ mean?” she asked. “You steamed it open and re-sealed it, didn’t you.” She shrugged, a silent ‘duh’.
~ “Wow,” says the kid, blinking hard.  One of his eyes is half-swollen shut, so it looks like it’s an actual effort.  “I really hope you’re rescuing me, because if the guy who was hitting me yesterday finds out I’m cheating on him with another guy who’s going to hit me, he’s going to be so pissed off.”  
~ The kid, maybe not possessed of a properly-developed sense of self-preservation, keeps going.  “Word was your team killed a general and tried to steal a billion dollars.”
~ “Jesus, no, I’m fine.  No, I don’t have a concussion.  Yes, I know I always say that.”  He shoots Hannibal a slightly desperate look.  “Clay.  Clay!  Look, I made new friends!”  He shoves the phone in Hannibal’s direction.
~ “The man is wearing body armour in the HQ…and that should tell you everything you need to know about how much we like the CIA around here.”
~
“Ooh,” says Jensen, sometime later, “That’s one of Lichtjahr’s next-gen high-security data drives.”  He smiles, and makes what Face can only describe as grabby hands.  “Can I see?  Please?” And by ‘see’, Jensen clearly means ‘hack’.
~
“And really, no.  No way.  We’ll find you something less dangerous to flirt with.  Like a tiger shark, or maybe a thermonuclear explosion.” 
~ “I can still fucking hear all of you,” says Aisha, not looking up from the gun she’s cleaning. Murdock is talking in a low, slightly agitated tone.  “How is this fair?  You guys get a sniper and a hacker and a gorgeous badass lady.” “Yes,” Jensen points out reasonably, “But you guys got to fly a tank.  We never got to fly a tank.”

“My name still isn’t Barry.”
“But it should be, don’t you think?” Nathan looked around to take a group census. “Doesn’t he look like a Barry to you?”
~ “No, they’re in England, and in about eight hours, they’ll be in our dining room.” That was when all hell broke loose. While Ron was keeping up an impressive rant without stopping to take a breath (topics covered included: Draco Malfoy, The War, their second year at Hogwarts, expanding the table on short notice, and his failure as a parent for raising a daughter who thought it was polite to invite people to events without asking the host first), Hermione had already Apparated to the Potter’s and brought Harry and Ginny back with her to do damage control.
~
“They have been friends since they were twelve,” Harry pointed out. “He sort of is family, like it or not.” Ron fumed for a moment and then yelled “She’s too young to be dating!”  “We had been married a year when we were her age,” Hermione said. “Totally different circumstances,” Ron spluttered. ~
“Will you help me,” Ron asked Harry, although he accompanied the request with a glare. “Sure,” Harry said. It would have been a good opportunity for reconciliation, but they didn’t talk and spent the whole time staring at each other warily over piles of onions.
~
“Maybe they’ve all forgotten,” Ron said hopefully. Right as he said it, the doorbell rang. Hermione made a face, but quickly replaced it with a smile and opened the door and welcomed Draco and Astoria Malfoy into their home.
~
Rose tried mentioning that she was hungry and shouldn’t they sit down to dinner (although she was relieved when that went unheard because she wasn’t sure if introducing knives to the situation was a good idea).
~ “I’ll go ahead and admit it,” Scorpius said. “This was not my best idea ever.” “It was good in theory,” Rose sighed. They could just barely hear the shouting through the closed door. “We always thought that they would do better accepting us if they were brought together without much warning. We never counted on them being this mental.” “They can’t go on all night.” Rose stared at him. “When we left, they were fighting about some dueling club from their second year. They could go on all night.” She looked at the almost-empty pie tin. “Do you think anyone would notice if we summoned the roasted lamb up here?”
~
What he is surprised to see is Doctor McCoy already treating Kirk’s wounds, fresh bruise forming on his right eye and he’s muttering and wrapping up Kirk’s hand. Kirk giggles and then he snorts and then he moans in pain because he nose must be broken and McCoy shakes his head.
~
Harry sighed. “I thought I told you both to stay outside?” he said, resignedly.  “You said yourself that you didn’t think we’d listen,” said John. “We were just fulfilling your expectations.” ~
“I got shot,” he informs her, almost enthusiastically, and Jack hides a grin at the sudden fury on her face. He’d given Edmund some pretty good painkillers, and he didn’t regret that particular decision in the least.
~ ‘Well,’ thought Tosh, resignedly, as the forcefield bzzzp’ed into place, ‘at least it’s one of the nicer cells I’ve been in.’ “Right,” said Gwen, after a moment. “Anybody think to grab a deck of cards before we left the hub?” Jack patted his pockets, then turned them inside out theatrically. “No such luck. I can think of another way to pass the time, though.” “Not in a cell with transparent doors,” said Gwen in dry tones.
~
“This better be an emergency,” Arthur says when he picks up the phone, already alert and trying to cling to the tendrils of unassisted dreams. “It is, duckling,” Eames says. “I may be in a spot of trouble.” “If they want ransom, they’re not getting it,” Arthur says. “They can have you.”
~ “Well,” Eames says. “Your speed limits are so pedestrian, really, that I couldn’t be bothered to pay attention.” “You’re going to jail for a speeding ticket?” Arthur says incredulously. “No, darling, keep up,” Eames says. “I got stopped for a speeding ticket. I got arrested for the warrant I have in Illinois, and I’m going to rot for the multiple federal crimes they’ve been searching for me for years for, not the least of which being me snatching a PASIV from your little military’s fingers.” “You’re the one who did that?” Arthur asks, impressed. “Keep on topic,” Eames says. “Can you call me a lawyer?” “Did you use me as your one phone call?” Arthur asks. “I did,” Eames says. “Aren’t you terribly pleased?” Despite himself, Arthur is. Just for that, Arthur calls him a good lawyer, instead of the schmuck Eames probably deserves.
~
Somehow, Arthur remains Eames’ one phone call. Or, to be precise, once a week Arthur gets a collect call from a nasty maximum security penitentiary. Eames sounds cheery. “I am making friends,” he says, without bothering with hello. Arthur closes his eyes. “Do not make friends,” Arthur says. “They’re lovely people, really,” Eames says. “They play cards with me. Sometimes I let them win.” “Don’t cheat at poker,” Arthur says. There’s an ominous silence. “Don’t play poker,” Arthur says, getting nervous.”Don’t touch a deck of cards with your grubby little fingers anymore. For your own sake. Please.” “Everyone is bad at it,” Eames says, sulky. “It’s too easy anyway.” “They will kill you,” Arthur says. “Kill you dead. Permanently.” “Will you miss me if I get shanked in the back?” Eames asks. “I’m touched.” “Don’t get too happy about it,” Arthur mumbles, and runs a hand through his hair. There’s an outburst in the background. “Oh,” Eames says. “A potential riot. I must be going love, ta!” “Don’t get shanked!” Arthur yells, but Eames has already hung up.

But soon, that asshole, shithead incompetent jackass (he’s just going by Frank now, was Charlie’s oh-so-helpful input) had become more and more necessary on the case.

“I want ‘I told him it was a bad idea’ written on my gravestone, just for the record,” Dean replied gruffly, fingering the knot in his tie, and Sam couldn’t help smiling.
~
Sam closes his eyes and clenches his jaw and counts to himself like he does about ten times a day now. He doesn’t press his fingers against the bridge of his nose, though, so he can’t be that pissed. Eventually, he comes out of this calming state to say, “And no, Alec, you can’t have any candy.” It’s not like Alec didn’t know this was coming, having ingested nearly two whole slices of pie last night, but it’s still a terrible blow. Sam’s immediate rejection of the idea of Alec having candy is bad enough on its own, but this is why he hadn’t asked to go the candy aisle in the first place - Sam wouldn’t have had to know. There could have been thievery and candy consumption and Alec would have had the thrill of several deceptions to get him through the night. And he really wants sugar. He looks pleadingly up at Dean. This will work, he knows. This always works. Dean tries to look away. He always tries to look away. And Alec always grabs his hand just like he’s doing now, puts gentle pressure against the coarse palm and tugs ever so lightly until Dean looks back down into those green bottomless wells of despair Alec calls eyes.
“Aw, Sam-”
“No, Dean. He’s had enough sugar to feed half the children in South Dakota. The answer is no.”
~ “Thank you,” she tells Kirk when she next sees him, between classes. He looks uncomfortable for a minute, then gives her a kind of sideways smile.
“I don’t sleep with people who aren’t sober enough to properly appreciate the mind-blowing brilliance of the experience,” he tells her, adding a broad wink before walking away to class.
~ “You are a troglodyte,” Nyota informs him fondly, without a trace of malice or irritation. “An utter troglodyte, and I will never date you, not if I live to be a hundred. And now I am going to go celebrate with some ice cream, and you are not invited. Enjoy your afternoon.”
~ “There’s a poem I’d like to recite to you,” Kirk says, leaning back in the boat, staring up at the clouds, “about roses and hay, I think, and maybe shepherdesses, and somebody’s mistress. Unfortunately, I don’t actually remember the poem. But I want you to know that I would recite it if I could.”
“I may throw up on you,” she tells him. “Also, why would you recite a poem to me?”
“Weeell…” he says, leaning against the side of the boat and trailing a finger in the water, “it just struck me as a little more classy than just saying, ‘hey, we’re about to die, let’s get it on.’”
“I want to vomit,” she replies. “I just can’t tell anymore if it’s because of seasickness or because of you.”
“Definitely seasickness,” he says blithely. “You know, I happen to know a great way to distract you from that, and from our impending doom.”
“There is no impending doom.” Nyota is very firm on this point.
~
“I will never be drunk enough to admit how much you mean to me,” he slurs, then stops and cocks his head to one side, frowning. “Except right now, apparently,” he acknowledges, his consonants such a mush that Nyota’s pretty sure no one without advanced linguistics training would be able to understand him.
~
“I could hold her for a minute, if you wanted to have an arm free to hit me,” he offers.
Nyota glares at him. “Do you even know how to hold a baby?” she asks. 
Kirk winks. “I know how to treat a lady at any age.”
“Appalling,” Nyota mutters, but she carefully transfers her little girl into Kirk’s steady hands.
“Hey there, gorgeous,” he whispers, and Nyota rolls her eyes. “Your mommy gets mad,” he says solemnly, “when I say nice things about her, about how pretty she is. But you won’t get mad, will you?” Kirk apparently takes her silence as agreement.
“She likes me!” he exclaims, looking up at Nyota excitedly, like a little boy opening a present on Christmas morning.
“That makes one of us,” Nyota mutters, but her heart isn’t in it, and he’s not listening anyway, cooing at her daughter, “I like you, too, gorgeous. Yes, I do.” Nyota resigns herself to the inevitability of the fact that, when her daughter turns thirteen or so, she’s going to develop a massive crush on Jim Kirk, who will probably be utterly wonderful about it and gently redirect her attentions to some more appropriate object, and remain her Cool Uncle Jim while Nyota and Spock become people she’s embarrassed to be seen with in public.
“I like you thiiis much!” he says, still looking adoringly down at the baby, with a big goofy smile. Oddly, she’s sort of looking forward to it.

“He’d dance,” Luke recounts, his eyes looking a little glazed over with numbing anguish, “and then the hippos would dance after him. And do some of those little heel clicks — do hippos even have heels?” “Are you critiquing your dream for factual accuracy?” Lorelai asks fondly. “It was terrible. The mental image followed me around all day. When Kirk came into the diner, I kept checking to make sure there wasn’t a hippo parade behind him.”
~ “And you couldn’t have told me about this before you threw me to the wolves?” Arthur asks. There’s a flood of something in his chest that feels like nothing more or less than relief. It’s taking over everything, including his ability to retain any sort of anger, any sort of hurt about this. “Sorry, darling,” Eames says. “You’re an appalling actor.” Arthur meets his eyes in the mirror. “See?” Eames says. “Right now you’re attempting to look disgusted, but mostly you look impressed at my brilliant plan.” And god help him, he is.
~ “Mother,” he says, and they exchange the sort of kiss that involves neither coming close to touching one another.
~ “I’ll leave you again,” Arthur blurted out. “If it isn’t safe, if I put you in danger—” “You seem to forget that I am not a romance novel heroine, but a grown man with years of military training,” Eames interrupted. “That speech is much more likely to make me punch you than to make me swoon.”
~
“Seriously?” Arthur asks, bemused. “I shot you and you’re worrying about your shirt?” “It was a gift,” Eames says, but doesn’t object when Arthur comes closer, ripping at Eames’ sleeve to make a make-shift tourniquet. “From my mum.”
“Is your mother blind?” Arthur mutters. “That’s not on. First you shoot me and ruin my shirt, now you’re insulting my mum. You are a horrible person, really you are.”

“Take it back,” Pepper says, “or I’ll tweet those photos of you. And yes, before you say anything, you know which photos I mean.”
“You have the mind of a true Machiavelli, Potts,” Tony murmurs in genuine admiration.
~
Thor scoffs a little as the door closes behind Pepper. Tony doesn’t think he’s ever actually seen a person scoff before outside of a nineteenth century novel, but somehow Thor pulls it off.
~
“Is it a social call, a business call, a grab the nearest heavy artillery and circle the wagons call? Specificity is key.”
Arthur clears his throat. He’s trying not to laugh. He always clears his throat when he’s trying not to laugh. “It’s a business call.” “Of course it is. Forgery?” “You wouldn’t expect me to call you if my sink were leaking, would you?” “I’m rather good at plumbing; you never know.” “I didn’t know that.” “And now you do.”
~
“If you don’t have an exceptionally good reason for missing my birthday, you can expect your disinheritance papers in the post directly,” his mother said by way of greeting. “I can explain,” Eames said.  “Please do.” Eames was in the shit because the job had taken two weeks longer than planned and he’d missed her sixtieth birthday. He had also nearly been killed by the Pruszków Mob and was currently stranded in a cabin in Suwałki with three of his associates and about nine feet of snow outside, but he didn’t really think the details would help him at that moment. “I’m working.” “Working.” His mother said the word “working” the same way other people said “bubonic plague” or “polyester.”

“I am fine. Deyva is fine. The children are fine,” Yusuf says, bustling around. “They all wish you would come back to Mombasa. There is no one to tell the children crude stories and teach them bad words in French. Deyva has had to resort to smacking me with newspapers now. Even the cat misses you, that traitorous beast.” Yusuf turns and grins at Eames just as he’s mixing a blue liquid with the brown contents of a separate flask. The resulting mushroom cloud could put Chernobyl to shame. Eames blinks. Everything is white. “Am I blind?” he asks with some degree of seriousness even as he tries to fan the smoke from his face. Since he can see his hand moving in front of him, he assumes he’s not. Yusuf coughs from somewhere. “It was supposed to do that.” “Do you lie to Deyva like this?” Eames asks. “No wonder she hits you with newspapers.” “I can fix this.” There’s a clatter, the unmistakable noise of glass shattering and then a buzzing noise. The smoke begins to clear.  Eames blinks more. He can just make out Yusuf holding an electric fan before him like a shield in the heat of battle. “Electric fan. Best invention of the Twentieth Century.” Yusuf says. “Nineteenth Century,” Eames corrects. “Schuyler Wheeler. Eighteen eighty-six.” Yusuf sticks out his tongue. “Must you be so smart? It’s very annoying for the rest of us.”
~
“He’s very good,” Yusuf says before Eames can answer. “I still don’t know if the Rivera in my kitchen is real or fake.” “Your wedding present is not a fake,” Eames says, offended. He bought that painting at Sotheby’s. And it was not cheap.
~
“Es-tu en France?” his mother queries. She asks him if he’s in France as though he speaks French anywhere else on the planet besides in France. Or in Haiti. Or in Martinque or French Polynesia. Or in most of continental Africa. Or Canada — but not Quebec. Nothing against Quebecois, it’s just not French. Actually it is a rather valid question.
~
There is no such thing as the best place to find a croissant in Paris. That’s like asking someone where the best place to find a baguette is. Or a fashionable woman. They are everywhere, it only requires leaving your hotel. And sometimes not even that.
~ “You have been known to hit the tables.” “I’ve also been known to wear pink paisley, that doesn’t mean it’s all I do.”
~
The look on Eames face is an expression he got from his mother he likes to call “we are not amused.”
~ John’s eyebrows furrow. “Frank,” he says, “is dangerous.” Sam snorts because, hello kettle? John glares. “Don’t be a smartass.”  
~
Ariadne is making fierce but silent waving motions with her hand. Arthur is unsure of what she’s trying to achieve, and therefore feels no obligation to respond.
~ "You cannot stay here and invent rock and roll. For one thing, you'll destroy history. For another, we need to get home."
~ “It’s obvious to anyone with half a brain that he loves you.” “Not to me!” “Which proves my point entirely.”
~ “I'm on sabbatical, remember? Which officially means that I'm writing several papers that may one day be turned into a book. In reality it means that I reorganize my home office, stare out the window, and take apart and reassemble the electronics in my house. Please save me from myself."

"I need something I can use against him!"
"I can arrange that."
"Legally use against him."
"Also can be arranged, though with more difficulty."
"Obtained legally."

"Do you call just to make me worry about you?" He asked wearily.

“I don’t get injured that often,” Terry grumbles. Bruce raises his eyebrows and snorts before walking back to the computer.
“Dislocated shoulder last week,” he points out.
“He was made out of rocks!” Terry protests. “I couldn’t help it!”
~
“I love you,” he adds. She makes a noise that would probably be I love you too if it had come from an awake person, and puts her feet over his to warm them up.
~ “Ow,” he manages after a long silence. There’s a rush of wind in the background when Max replies.
“I’m on my way,” she says. “How bad is it?”
“Really ow,” Terry grunts, pulling himself up slowly and painfully. 
~ Dean clears his throat. “So you, uh, know about all the…” He twirls his finger in a circle, the universal symbol for ‘crazy, impossible shit.’ Scully’s mouth turns up in a small smile.
~
Eames is lounging in a chair to his left and they’re having an argument about subconscious militarization—or rather Eames is proposing ludicrous ideas and Arthur is pointedly ignoring him in favor of prepping himself for the meeting—when a small balding man with glasses surreptitiously makes his way towards them.
~ He pauses a moment, studies the brown sports jacket that Eames has thrown on and he says very patiently, “Eames, your dress shirt is the same color as your pants. Neither match your jacket.” “Pour me some wine, Caffrey,” Eames says. “At least there isn’t any tweed,” Neal agrees. Arthur warms up considerably to Neal. “I tried burning it all,” Arthur informs Neal, “But he showed up too early. I think he’s got a sixth sense about these things.”
~ Mal adores Eames, predictably calling him “full of joie de vivre”, and delightedly urges him to greater lengths of ridiculousness. Cobb calls Eames “eccentric”, which is Dom-speak for “batshit”.
~
"Yeah well if I had you would have just found a way to weasel out of it." Harvey gave her his best, 'Who me?' smile. Chloe rolled her eyes and turned to Mike. "Harvey only pretends to like me because I paid for his vacation home in Tuscany."
"You have a vacation home in Tuscany?" Mike gaped at Harvey.
"It's technically a Villa," Harvey said.
"Can I—"
"No," Harvey cut him off before he could finish. "It's not that I don't like you,” he said to Chloe, “It's just that every time you show up here, my whole world gets turned upside down." Chloe rolled her eyes again and sighed, sinking back into her chair. 
"Twice. That's happened twice. Does he always exaggerate this much?" she asked Mike.
~ "You said someone was shot. Is that a code for something because I don't ever remember making that a code but I brought my kit just in case it wasn't a code—" Neal grabbed Mozzy by the shoulders and spun him around to face Oliver. "So it's not a code?" Mozzy asked and turned back to Neal. "Neal, why is Oliver Queen bleeding from a gunshot wound at your kitchen table?"
~ The two of them are best friends who cannot stand each other. Both would lay down their life for the other, and the other would always fucking hate him for it.
~
Clarifying, Clay offered, "Jensen may or may not have either started or ended an international incident involving a horse trailer and shrubbery at one of their galas. None of us are real clear on how things actually went down, save for it ended with him puking over the balcony and blaming it on invisible garden gnomes."
~
"Everybody stop talking right now," said Merina. "This is bad. Anybody says anything else, someone's going to wink out of existence and we're not even going to remember they were ever here."
~
There's a long moment of silence, and then Jensen bursts out laughing. "No, really, Clay," he says, wiping the corner of his eyes. "Who's the real mark?" Clay gives him a look. Jensen glances at Aisha, standing next to the projector, but she just raises an eyebrow at him. "Shit," he says.
~
"Pretend I'm the best sea captain ever. Like, I've sailed every sea and ocean there is to sail, I know all the small islands and the bays and the shallow waters and I've had sex with mermaids; that's how awesome a sea captain I am." "Mermaids?" Aisha says, giving him a long look. "Forget the mermaids," Jensen shakes his head. "Now take Tony Stark. Tony Stark's computer system, to be precise. I may be the best captain in the world, but Tony Stark is uncharted waters. You know, the place on the map with the words 'here be dragons'." "So you're saying that if you get yourself acquainted with the territory, you'll be able to have sex with mermaids in Tony Stark's uncharted waters," Aisha says. "Yes. No," he frowns. "I think this metaphor just got away from me."
~
A holographic interface. Stark's computer has a holographic interface. For a moment Jensen wonders if he could quit the Losers and actually stay here and work for Tony Stark and his beautiful, beautiful holographic interface. Then he thinks of Aisha and her knives.
~
“Just because I'm a woman—” Sherlock begins, and then stops because that's wrong. Because John isn't looking self-righteously justified or chivalrously guilty, but honestly bewildered. “You didn't come after me because I'm a woman,” she realises, knowing she's right but not understanding why. She looks for some kind of clue in John's face, but there's nothing – only the expression of someone who'd thought this was too obvious to actually discuss.
~
Nate stared at Hardison expectantly; he didn't move. "So let's hear what they're saying," Nate prompted.
Hardison shook his head firmly. "The man doesn't want an audience. He can break me with his pinky finger, Nate. His pinky finger."
When Nate failed to look sympathetic, Hardison grumbled under his breath and put the laptop on the table in front of him. He opened the case and without a key being tapped, Nate heard the sound of muted voices. He leveled an old fashioned look at the hacker. "Really?"

“I am going because I have to change for dinner, not because you told me to,” Yusuf says. “Are you five?” Eames says.
~
“Swimmingly,” Eames replies. “I swear, I’m going to make a list of words you can only get away with using if you’ve got a British accent,” Ariadne says. “And ‘swimmingly’ is going to be the first thing on it.”  “Promise you’ll put ‘posh’ on it, too. I can’t stand it when Americans say ‘posh,’ you haven’t got the history for it,” Eames says. “You know I adore you, and your country, but really. Keep your flat vowels away from the Queen’s English.”
~ “Didn’t your mother ever tell you your face would stick that way?”  “No,” Yusuf said, his frown relentless, “because my mother was not a manipulative buffoon.”  “What are you implying about my mother?” Eames asked almost lazily, digging through his camera bag for a better lens.  “Nothing,” Yusuf said, deflating. “Your mother is a lovely woman.”
~ “It’s a negative ad,” Dom said into the eventual silence. “It isn’t as if he’s committed murder. In fact, he hasn’t even committed a misdemeanor. It’s well within his rights to accuse me of killing my wife.”  “Right,” Arthur said slowly. “What you don’t seem to be grasping, here, is that it’s also despicable, not to mention that it shows all the political flair of pond scum.”
~
“Oh God, why don’t we just install a fucking dictatorship already,” Arthur demands in the middle of August as the days limp feebly past. The thermometer seems to be the only thing in Florida with any energy, leaping upward without any regard whatsoever for the laziness this kind of humidity ought to engender.  “That would require organizing a coup,” Dom points out from where he is slumping against his headboard, hair drooping into his eyes. “It’s not even close to worth the effort.” Yusuf sighs. “I’m trying to think of something encouraging and energetic to say,” he explains to the room at large, “but I’m failing.”
~ “I just want you to know that if you weren’t an absolutely necessary component of the plan I would shoot you in the head right now.”
~
Jim and Spock are hilariously busy until about day eight, when Bones suddenly looms behind him on the Bridge and says, "Jim, say 'Spock, you are relived of duty for eighteen hours'." "Spock, you are relived of duty for eighteen hours," repeats Jim, who knows what is good for him. "Good job," says Bones approvingly. "Now say, 'Mr Sulu, you have the conn for the rest of your shift, and someone else can have it after you, because I am off-duty for eighteen hours'." "Hey!" says Jim. Bones just stares at him. There is not even a demand in his eyes, just the overwhelming knowledge that the world is going to arrange itself to fit his expectation of how it should be. Jim sighs. "Mr Sulu, you have the conn until our medical overlord allows me back here."
~
"I know Jimmy likes to play dumb," says Bones, his accent stronger than usual, "but y'all have looked at his grades lately?" "Thank you, McCoy, this why I love you best," says Jim loudly. "I had always assumed there must be hidden depths," says Spock, straight faced. "Surely not every species in the faculty finds humans sexually attractive." "Die in a fire," Jim says to him.
"Mr Kirk," ventures the head of Xenolinguistics, "You were the author of the paper on pre-Reformation Vulcan love poetry?" Bones freezes for a second.
"Uh," says Jim, looking around for an escape.
"Pre-Reformation love poetry," repeats Bones, as if the words are as fine whiskey in his mouth. "Pre-Reformation Vulcan love poetry. Why, Jimmy..."

"Uhura, can I love you best instead?" asks Jim, turning his back on the vipers in his bosom and giving Uhura his most pleading look.
Uhura actually hesitates for a second. "Will you teach me to swear in pre-Reformation Vulcan?" she says. Clearly she is a woman of priorities.
"Like a sailor," promises Jim, hand on his heart.
~
This is what Dean got for being friendly with supernatural beings with no appreciation of pop culture or humanity in general. 
~
“Look left,” Cas commanded. On his left ahead a couple hundred yards was a familiar sight, trench coat blowing out behind him from the cars whizzing by giving the impression of wings. Dean allowed himself a small giggle at the irony, if only all the jerks honking knew whom they were ignoring. The figure started waving his arms up and down as Dean approached. He looked like a deranged tax collector as he tried to keep the phone to his ear and wave with both arms simultaneously. “I am the one signaling you.” Cas said unnecessarily.
~ Mycroft closed his eyes and raised his face heavenward for patience. "Sherlock, driving does not work on a triage system. It doesn't matter who has the more important journey. He had the right of way. We have to be courteous. So we don't die."
~ Darcy reads the paperwork, which is thirty-seven pages long, detailing every item and event she had witnessed or been party to in the weeks prior to Thor’s exile to Midgard and the end of her internship and return to school in California. It has an index and an appendix and she reads through those, too. She signs it. Because the whole ordeal pisses her off just a little, she signs her middle name as “You Have Got To Be Kidding Me” in the sixteen places that got the full signature and initials DYHGTBKML in twenty-three more.
~ “Can you believe they were just giving this away? Who’d want to get rid of this?”
“A blind man who suddenly recovered his sight?”
~ “It’s a personal injury case. A very personal injury. I got impaled in the buttocks by one of Reg’s antlers.”
~ “You got my back, right?”
“Nope. I’m not signing that blank cheque.”
~ “Hey, is that Crackhead Cathy? Hi, Cathy.”
“Why you guys gotta call me that all the time? I did heroin.”
~ Me: “That’s terrible acting. What sort of accent is that supposed to be?”
Megan: “Racist?”
~
“The hooker’s name is Ginger Belle. Seriously, her real name is Ginger Belle. It’s like her parents didn’t want her to go to college.”
~ “Alas, time travellers, I cannot join you in your revels. I shall, however, celebrate on my own. Perhaps with some future-vodka. Or some rum. From the past.”
~ “No, she’s too fat. Tell her to come back when she has an eating disorder.”
~
Me: “He’s gorgeous enough that I’d forgive him that youthful indiscretion.”
Megan: “As you laughed happily under the shade of a large oak tree together, atop a red and white checkered blanket, sipping white wine and noshing on homemade delicacies, you would refer to her as "the mistake" and throw back your heads to laugh merrily again, tones like happy fairies skating on water.”
~ “I wonder if they call King-sized sheets Presidential-sized in England?”
~ The first thing Tony Stark said to Steve Rogers was, "Hey, you're Captain America."
The second was, "Here, hold this."
~
“I did mention that, and then we argued for a bit. He threatened a level of physical violence I wasn’t comfortable with, and I backed off.”
~ “Well, what if I threatened to beat it out of you?”
“Then I’d respect that. And me and my brother Neil here—” The mountain of a man behind him took two steps forward. “—would defend ourselves as best we could, by separating your head from the rest of your body and forcing you to eat it.”
~ “He’s in the boot of my car.”
“Can he breathe?”
“Sure!” he responded blithely. Paused. “At least, I think so.”
~ “If you beat them up, then they go off, get better and come back with their friends. If you cut bits off and post it to those friends, that doesn’t happen as much. It’s more efficient.”
~ “Well, that’s just maddeningly unhelpful.”
~
"Lemme ask you a question—Arthur says he's in 'information distribution.' On a scale of one to bullshit, how thoroughly should I investigate your background to figure out just what the fuck you're doing with my baby brother?"
~ Had all things been equal, she would have believed him. His surprise, tinted with panic and disbelief, seemed genuine. But the phone records didn't lie, while Peter Bishop could lie very, very well.
~
He rubs a hand against his beard. He hasn't shaved it off yet. He might not at all since he's past the itchy stage and he's kind of fond of the way people cross the street to not jog by him when he takes the trash out.
~ "I don't remember signing a contract on this folly." Arthur leans back and rubs his eyes. Eames huffs out an annoyed breath. "You're bored, curious, and at leisure. You're going to lose your mind if you don’t work. I have a job. I have a job involving dangerous men and guns. What more do you need to know?" "Ideally, everything."  "This is suboptimal then, because I'm giving you nothing. It's a mystery. Don't ask me why I called you, don't bore us both that that kind of recursive tedium."
~ Arthur taps in Morse code against Eames's palm. SITREP? Eames taps back FUBAR.
~ "Don't take your temper out on third parties, Arthur," Eames barks at his back.  Yusuf is placid in the face of their hostility. He waves at Arthur and approaches to shake his hand. "The beard and hair are unexpected. Otherwise, you look hale."
~ "We could channel this to the authorities," Arthur muses. "I know you're taking the piss now." Eames pours himself another drink of liquid death.  "It's an option. Not locals, obviously, but someone earnest at INTERPOL." He doesn't really mean this, he's just winding Eames up.  He gets a long sigh. "Please stop insulting my intelligence."
Arthur tosses his pen across the room. "It's been a while since I did something like this." "Yes, but this is bicycles and sex, and you know it."
~
"Don't treat me like a bitch." Pender turns back around in a huff.  "Americans are so delightful," Eames's friend Morris informs them all in a bright, cheerful voice.
~ Eames watches him in the mirror. "That's yes to the jacket then," he hums to himself, running the zipper up and down slowly. "I never thought I'd see that look on your face. Of all people, Arthur, never you." His voice breaks softly around the words. "It's a good look on you." Arthur meets his own eyes in the mirror and sees sex in the half-lidded eyes and way he's holding his bottom lip between his teeth unconsciously. "Don't cut your hair," Eames says in a tone that's clearly not a request.
~
"I'm about to tell you a story that you're going to think is a distress plea. It's not. Every bit of it is true. Please wait for me to finish before booking your airline tickets."  "I'm agreeing with more than a few reservations."
~ Eames finds him later when Arthur is reading Wikileaks (he shuts the window really fast) on his phone. It's dark and the lights out the window twinkle in a fetchingly romantic way if you were raised on sentimental movies set in Los Angeles like most of the Western world. Eames flops down bonelessly with a sigh. "I apologize for my simian display. I suppose I could have completed the scene by pulling my trousers down and shaking my posterior in your face before flinging excrement, but, really, who can go to so much effort when belligerently angry?"
~ He packs his emotions up into the place they go when he's working. He'll evaluate his own reaction to this later.
~ Arthur passes over the Canadian border in the trunk of a car. His life is such that this isn't the first time for this.
~
"Killing my enemies was romantic, if psychotic. Please refrain from murder sprees to express affection in the future."
~ Eames clicks his tongue and when he speaks, it's with a veneer over the words, the same voice he uses with clients. "Did you know that I was sitting right at your feet when the shot came through the window? The blood from the wound hit my face. Not a first, obviously, but a rather memorable experience. I'd promised myself this conversation wasn't ever going to happen, by the way. I don't know why I'm bothering to disclaim that, but I am." Arthur recognizes immediately a classic case of PTSD. He knows it from the inside out. The situation clicks together, snap, and Arthur knows that Eames's big unsaid is that he watched Arthur take a round and didn't jump in front of it.
~
"The only one with any sense is Chapel," Bones gripes. "And I probably won't even get stationed with her." He ponders the injustices of his future; it makes Bones happy to be upset. "Probably get Banner."  "Probably," Jim agrees blithely, grinning. "Jim, don't let anyone tell you you're a good friend," Bones informs him around his scotch. "Because you suck."
~ "Vulcan pig, dunno why we even put up with you," Peaches' friend says.  "Because if you had attempted to conquer Vulcan we would have destroyed you," Spock replies very logically. Kirk buries his face in his hands with a groan. There's a muffled gasp, then another, and the bar goes quiet. Jim peeks out, and then stares. Peaches and Cream are on the floor, and Spock is handing him the money. "Jim," Spock urges patiently, holding out the money. 
Jim takes it, still staring at the collapsed forms. "Spock, tell me you didn't kill them," he says finally.  "Humans are a melodramatic race," Spock observes.
~ There are times when he feels so old. Like now, sitting at the bar of a club he can't pronounce the name of, listening to music he doesn't recognize (though that last one, he decides, doesn't count as a point against him – the music's so loud you can't hear anything but the bass).
~ The puppy is too small to climb up on the sofa on his own. The tip of a tiny black nose bobs over the line of the cushion with ever aborted jump, each attempt punctuated with a frustrated squeak. Ash may be a crusty old bastard, but even he can't resist that. As soon as the pup's paws hit the cushion he's on his back, little legs waving in the air. He looks Ash right in the eye, as if to say, “Rub my belly. I'll die if you don't, and do you really want a dead puppy on your conscience?”
~ “Well, when he gets back, tell him he’s fired, and I need my armour polishing.”
Gaius, to his credit, maintains a straight face. “Will you need the armour polishing before or after Merlin is fired, sire?”
~
Merlin doesn’t open his eyes, doesn’t shift or murmur. His face is pale, the hollows of his cheeks shadowed, the skin of his eyelids blue. His chest doesn’t rise and fall, no matter how long Arthur stares at it and wills it to. “Come on, Merlin,” he croaks. “Don’t be stupid. You’re not allowed to be dead after I came all this way.” 
~ "Your weekly phone call to your mother is in five minutes, sir," she tells him, and hands him his coffee.
~
"Right, of course. You want to talk to your brother in private, so instead of giving him a call like a normal person, you kidnap his flatmate," John mutters, but he doesn't sound angry, just exasperated. Mycroft can be like that sometimes. She'd complained about how long it took to get to work once, and he'd found her a new apartment and scheduled movers for her, before she'd found out and had to explain to him that no, she hadn't meant it like that and yes, she wanted to stay in her current flat.
~ "But we stand to make thirty five to sixty percent of eleven point five million dollars, after hotel bills and expenses! What do you say? I think the good Mrs. Oluwa Matumbo at least deserves the honor of our reply, the old dear." Mickey puts down his paper and draws himself up to his full seated height. "Don't bait the Nigerians, Danny, they can't help that they're hopelessly incompetent."
~
Ash shrugged. "I make it a point never to believe more than half the stories Albert tells." The corner of his mouth quirked in a smile. "Trouble is, I can never tell which half to believe." He caught Mickey's eye, and the kid broke out in a grin.
~ It actually took him a moment to figure out what to say and a moment longer to convince himself that he was actually going to have to say it, however ridiculous it seemed. "Christy. I am not sleeping with Mark. I'm not dating Mark, I'm not interested in Mark, Mark isn't gay."
Christy's head jerked up like a lion spotting its prey. "Mark isn't gay? Just Mark?"
~
"I thought the hero was the one supposed to get the cool gadgets," Eduardo says.
Mark finishes clicking his watch back together. "Clearly this means you are my sidekick," he says. "Don't worry, sidekick is a very reasonable position."
~
"Tell me you're not selling drugs." Harvey had said unexpectedly one morning a month into his two-month plan.
"I'm not selling drugs," Mike said, caught off guard, and the sincerity in his voice made Harvey look up and scrutinize him carefully.
"You need to sleep more."
"According to recent studies, about a third of American adults get less than the recommended eight hours of sleep." Mike pointed out, raising an eyebrow so that Harvey knew that Mike was including him in this number.
~
"Probably arrested," Tom speculates, at which point the general newsroom line starts ringing, and he reaches over to snatch the receiver, saying, "'Lo?" There's a long pause before Tom says, "Holy shit, I'm psychic."
[…]"Of course they don't have any reason to hold him, I'm sure Eames knows better than to get into a physical altercation with the police," Dom is saying into his cell phone, huddled in the backseat of Arthur's Prius with a sheaf of documentation their newsroom lawyers have instructed them to bring to the police station.  Tom and Arthur trade looks in the front seat. "I don't think he knows better," Tom confides. "That's a very diplomatic version of what I was going to say," Arthur agrees.
~
Eames, Tom, and the kid stare at him. "Do you think I'm fucking around?" Arthur asks, conversationally murderous. "Because I'm not fucking around." The kid swallows hard, because the kind of exhausted insanity Arthur is feeling is universal and telegraphed in the tightness of his shoulders and the fierce craziness of his eyes. "Now, sit the hell down." The kid sits. "He's a copy editor," Tom explains to the holding cell at large.
~
“Luckily I’m wearing my Probable Cause Door-Kicking shoes.”
~ “Donna,” he says her name immeasurably gently, “this is not your kitchen.” “Don’t be ridiculous. This,” she breaks off, for the first time noticing that she is in an unfamiliar room. Spinning around, trying vainly to find anything that resembles her kitchen, she comes to face him again and finishes, “Is not my kitchen.”
~ The idea of giving gifts comes to him like a slap to the back of the head from god, only made better by the fact that it's such a challenge. Arthur is Arthur; he has everything that he needs (probably indexed somewhere on thin yellow paper) so it's Eames' job to find out what he wants. He dismisses flowers as childish, reconsiders, buys roses and then notices in frustration that one of the bunch is wilting just as Arthur approaches with a quizzical expression. He gives them to Cobb with a flourish instead, because he'll be damned if Arthur gets imperfect things from him. And if Cobb has an ensuing crisis of sexual identity, that's not his problem.
~
Cobb is wearing his sternest father-of-two, no-you-may-not-have-that-Barbie-dream-house expression, managing to be affectionate and massively intimidating at the same time. "We need to talk." "Do we? Because we could always, you know, be manly and repressed about it—"
~
"We're talking about how to cover the hotel entry points, right?" Yusuf asks, and Cobb reassures him very loudly and emphatically that yes they are, and how is his latest sedative coming along? The one with the painkillers and traces of dubiously legal hallucinogens to reduce the severity of ghost pain?
~
He informs Eames that it’s his job to feed the cat in the mornings, and that she will start meowing at least ten minutes before her actual breakfast time. “I refuse to bow to feline terrorism,” Eames informs Arthur seriously.
~ She hands the bottle to Cobb, looking viciously amused, and Cobb is quick enough (and evil enough) to toss it to Arthur, who catches it instinctually and then has to repress a few homicidal urges. “Really?” He says. “Very mature.” Cobb just shrugs, looking like a man who is trying very hard not to do a triumphant, I-don’t-have-to-spin-the-stupid-fucking-bottle fist pump. Arthur decides to ignore him with a vengeance and just spin the stupid fucking bottle.
~
“God, I love fairs,” Eames says as they wander through the cow barn. “Cows,” Arthur says, feeling really quite flatfooted. “I never would’ve put you down as being so intrigued by cows, Eames.” “Cows are spectacularly dull and almost unforgivably stupid but these cows, Arthur, are at a fair,” Eames says, as if that explains everything. Which apparently it does, because Arthur doesn’t ask any more questions. Instead he watches Eames gaze deeply into the brown eyes of a completely apathetic Guernsey and evaluates strategic exits from the barn.
~
“I sort of expected all of your furniture to be perfect,” Eames says thoughtfully. “But this couch has a definite squeak. And I do believe that’s a ketchup stain.” “I like to put ketchup on cold macaroni and cheese,” Arthur says, because it’s really just about as good as anything else he can come up with at this ludicrous hour of the morning. “That is disgusting,” Eames informs him, sounding pleased. “Are you here to insult the way I eat leftovers, or...?” Arthur says.  “Well, I hadn’t exactly factored it into the plan,” Eames says. “But to be honest I’m enjoying it quite a lot.”
~
“Remember that addict I dated?”
“James?”
“No, James was just skinny. Perry.”
~ “He’s got a pretty severe peanut allergy. Any contact and he goes into that shock I can’t pronounce.”
~ "I can't believe we're hunting ghost crocs. What the fuck is wrong with Florida? Can't we convince people to stop moving there? Disney's not that awesome."
~
"If you were dying, if you were about to be killed, in the very last seconds, what would you say?" "Please God, let me live," John responded immediately.  "Use your imagination," Sherlock said dismissively.  "I don't have to."
~ Not responding in words, Sam used his elbow to shove Dean out, actually pulling the door as shut as he could, the glass a barrier between the two men. Startled and more than a little mad, Dean reached for the handle of the door, meaning to jerk it open and shove back. But before he could put his plan into action, he caught sight of the woman behind the desk in the lobby. She was in her mid to late 40s, dark hair sprinkled with grey and pulled back into a loose ponytail. Her right hand had dropped behind the counter when the door opened, and Dean had little doubt that she'd put it on some sort of weapon. Her smile when she looked at the men on her doorstep was welcoming, but wary. Dean understood suddenly why Sam had shut him out, and he resigned himself to more time in the cold. There were certain people Sam led with and certain people Dean led with. Cautious, middle-aged women with tired eyes and pleasant, maternal faces were all Sam. "Hi." Sam said it softly, smiling his best "I'm a nice kid, not a deranged serial killer" smile hesitantly at the woman behind the counter. 
~
"I didn't say I didn't do honest jobs. I just said fun and easy was better than honest."
~
"I wanted to leave yesterday," Dean said, jabbing a finger at Sam.
"Dean says he wanted to leave yesterday," Sam relayed, propping his elbow on the window and resting his cheek on the phone in his hand
"And she made us stay. Tempted us and…"
"Yeah, you made us stay," Sam passed along. "Tempted us with one last load of laundry and one last home cooked meal and…"
"And pie," Dean accused suddenly. He paused. "She used pie against us," he intoned, glaring woundedly at the phone.
Sam rolled his eyes. "Damn you and your pie," he told her.
~
The Auror rules and regulations book has three-hundred and ninety-seven pages. Harry’s on page fifty-three when it occurs to him he’s never been very good at following rules.
~
"Aliens." "Yup." Jack nodded earnestly. "Seriously?"
"I save my joking for Thursdays." Dean leaned back in the chair, tilting it so the back two legs rose into the air before slamming into the dusty floorboards. "Huh." He shook his head. "Our lives are weird." Jack stared at Dean. "You're rather calm about all this." Understatement of the century. Dean grinned. "Would panicking help?" "It would make me feel better."
~ "You know," Jack added in his I-not-as-smart-as-the-rest-of-you-guys tone, "We could just go ask them."
~
"And I need to know things like how the hell you boys got your hands on all that paperwork." Dean smirked. "That's it? Really? That's an easy one. Sammy?" He turned to his brother with an expectant eye. Sam closed his eyes and seemed to gather himself. When he opened them his shoulders relaxed and his face became earnest and serious. "Good afternoon. I'm Special Agent Jobs and this is my partner, Special Agent Gates. We're with the Internal Oversight Advisory and we need to look through your records." Sam paused to wait for an imaginary response. "It's classified." Another pause. "I understand that procedure needs to be upheld, but this is a matter of national security and it's important that you let us do our jobs. Please. Lives are at stake." With the plea Sam's face softened. His eyebrows knitted together in an expression of pained worry even as his lower lip stuck itself out just ever so slightly, his mouth barely open as though he were praying. Worse, his hazel eyes seemed to double in size and shimmer, and for the moment Jack felt like he had been sucked into a Disney cartoon and he was the man running around killing the forest critters.
Dean smirked. "If it's any consolation we broke into the places where that didn't work. I can give you a list and explain how we got in."
~
Jack really didn't want to ask anything else. He wasn't certain he could handle the answers. He missed when life was simple and problems could be solved with bullets or by Daniel's geek speak. "Do either of you have secret magical powers?" The boys echoed twin looks of wry amusement. "Well," Dean drawled, "Fabulous secret powers were revealed to me the day I held aloft my sword and said, 'By the power of Greyskull!' " Jack lifted an eyebrow in dry amusement. "That was He-Man." "Was it?" Dean looked slightly confused as though trying to figure out how he could have got that one wrong while Sam snickered.
~
"You do know you can't do that anymore. I can only get the President to pardon you so many times."
~ Two thin personnel files and a post-it note were all that the envelope had held. She picked up the note first and read it out loud. "They're your problem now. Have fun."
~ "But if sharks did live in salsa-" "There are no such things as salsa sharks!" "But if there were, do you think Batman Shark repellent would work against them or would it be offset by the tamales?"
~ Sam slapped a hand over Dean’s mouth. “Sorry,” he apologized to Elizabeth. “Most days he gets his age confused with his shoe size.”
~
He leaned back and shoved a palm into Sam’s spine, sending the youngster into the water. Sam flailed in the air, hooking a hand on his brother’s leg as he descended. “Shi-” Dean cursed before disappearing into the waves with his brother.
~
Rousseau cocked his head in a dare. “You gonna come help big brother?” “I’ll fetch him a water bottle when he’s done because that’s all the help he’s going to need,” Sam responded dryly. Dean and Sam’s eyes met. Sam could read the glad you stayed out of it, bitch. His were conveying a go kill him, jerk. Dean’s nod was a promise of victory. Dean stepped back in the ring, giving Rousseau time to stretch and Warner time to rest. Behind Sam’s elbow, John Sheppard spoke up. “I take it you two are having problems with the marines,” John said conversationally. “We’re making all sorts of friends.”
~ "This is not my fault! And what the hell? Why can't I just not like Christmas? There are people who don't like Independence Day. I bet they don't get visited by ghosts!" "I'm a holiday spirit."
"Well, maybe they should. The assholes at the fireworks store could use a good ghost haunting." "I'm a holiday spir-!" The sound of a shotgun rent the night air, shaking snow loose from Bobby's roof even as the holiday ghost, spirit, uh, thing vanished is a shower of rock salt. Dean smiled smugly. "There. Problem solved." Sam rolled his eyes. "Guns are not the solution to every problem." Dean snorted. "And you're lucky they're not, otherwise I'd fill you with a holiday buckshot. Now get your ass in the house and go sing Bobby a carol or something." 
"How was having a haunted Christmas going to change my mind about liking it?" "Dean." Cas was using his "I disapprove of your humanity" tone. Which wasn't that different from his other tones, but, well, you know. "This is not a permanent solution."
~ “I hurt him, you’ll kill me.” Cougar summed up the bizarre conversation. “Pretty much. Have a nice night.” And then the gun was gone.
~ He can hear Cobb squint through the phone. “Why are you answering Arthur’s phone? Does Arthur know that you broke into his apartment?” “What? I said Arthur and Eames’s flat.” “Yeah, right, but does Arthur know that you’re there?” Eames tries smaller words. “Cobb, I live here. Of course he knows that I’m here.” More squinting is likely. “So put him on the phone.” “Put him on the –” He sighs. There isn’t enough tea in the world for this. “He’s in the shower.”
~
Yusuf frowns, pushing Eames back onto his barstool. “You’re talking nonsense. Too many shots or too few?”  “Too…” Eames blearily contemplates the disintegrating coaster for a moment. “Too few, Yusuf, far too few.” Yusuf does what any good friend would do and orders more shots.
~
Eames sighs grandly. “I told you all more than once! More than once! Does no one listen to me when I talk?” Arthur pats his knee consolingly. “You’re not a credible source, babe.”
~
“The engine just died on me, I don't have the parts to fix it, and my cell phone isn't getting reception." And somehow he still couldn't quite say the words 'I need help'.
~
"Can we stop talking about my non-existent homosexual incest?" ~
"Name seven Star Trek characters." "I don't know if I can do that," Sam admits. "Not even using all five shows? And, yes, there are five. The original series, the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise," says Gus. "And that doesn't take into account films or animated spin-offs." "Can we work together on our list?" Dr. Brennan asks. "No," says Gus. "We cannot have coffee together anymore if the two of you cannot each, on your own, come up with seven Star Trek characters." "That's the one with Darth Vader, right?" asks Dr. Brennan. She looks at Sam. "He's on my list, you can't use him." Sam's got this one in the bag.
~
"Sod off, you twat," was the mumbled reply from behind the cup of tea.
~ "Why didn't you tell me?" Lestrade demanded quietly. John was searching for an answer that didn't include 'Are you bloody mad! when the detective inspector cut in. "Nevermind, stupid question. Wait here. Don't move."
~
"Would you like some Jello? It always intrigues me that mankind has managed to take dehydrated collagen from animal skin and bones and make a dessert with it."
~
“They didn’t even have electrodes.” The mark said, sounding pleasantly baffled at his captor’s inadequacy and not the least concerned that he just narrowly missed a good shock to the system.
~
Upside down in a straight jacket, with dark hair a smudge beneath and just the faintest glint of two very intelligent light eyes watching his every move, John was not too surprised to see Sherlock. John tilted his head, fascinated and faintly amused, as if getting incrementally closer to Sherlock’s inverted degree would make this any less ridiculous. Sherlock smiled, perhaps a bit tighter than John thought it otherwise might’ve been if the blood wasn’t rushing quite so much to his head. 
“You may go ahead with your pithy one-liner of questionable humour now, John.” Sherlock informed him succinctly, his face no longer pale but an attractive shade of tomato.  
“Well, if you’re just hanging around.” John said obligingly, with his unapologetically bad sense of humour.
~ John just tilted his head slightly, acknowledging the comment without validating it in any way. 
~ “We never had any of their albums. Still, everybody knows Beatles songs, right? You learned them through osmosis or something.”
~ So, now, Mission: See Arthur’s Dimples (SAD) is on, even if it does have an unfortunate acronym (although the previous Mission: Annoy Arthur (AA) had the same problem).
~ “He’s not likely to wake up for a couple of hours yet.” Mycroft didn’t turn around. “Then why are you here?” John gave a dry, mirthless chuckle. “Because he might. You know how he likes to be contrary.”
~ Mycroft smirked and called “Anthea, can I do that?” She looked up from her Blackberry with a peppy smile. “Well no, sir, actually you can’t. You have me to do that sort of thing for you.”
~
"Eames, no way," she tells him.
"Ariadne, penguins," he replies.
She stares at him. "What?"
"I thought we were playing, say someone's name and then a completely nonsensical statement," he explains. "Am I doing it wrong?"
~ “What? Is it because I sent you those postcards? I didn’t even notice they were pornographic until after I sent them.” “Eames, that’s not possible, you’d had to have looked at them to — No, you know what, you can’t trick me into conversing with you. I can’t talk because I’m diffusing a bomb, Eames.”
~
“You’re about to hang up on me aren’t you,” Eames says, the inflection of his voice something like tragedy.
~
“Has anyone ever told you that you’re very direct? You could maybe benefit from a little more conversational sprinkles and frosting.”
~
“Hey, wait a minute,” he squawks, “Yet? I’ll have you know I am always one step ahead of the pack.” “Only one step?” Arthur asks, feigning concern. Eames considers sticking his tongue out, but he resists the temptation.
~ “Sure,” Cobb says, grabbing his coat. “Anyone else want to tag along?” It’s unclear whether he’s being sarcastic or not, so Arthur and Eames both shake their heads. “I’m supposed to wait for Yusuf to show up so I can help him with lab equipment,” Eames says. Arthur just gestures to the stacks of paper on his makeshift desk as if to say, ‘have you seen the amount of work I need to get done?’
~ “No,” Arthur says, but he’s never been a very good liar. “I haven’t the faintest idea.”
~ “I mean, do you care about him? Not just as a colleague or…you know…okay, apparently you don’t, but. You know. Do you like him?” “This is a beautiful moment,” Eames says, smiling at him ruefully. “I’ve reduced Dominic Cobb – virtual genius and the most wanted mind-criminal in twelve different countries — to a gossiping schoolgirl.”
~ “I’m not your love counsellor. You’ve never had a problem wooing someone before. Why not try what usually works?” “It’s never mattered before, has it?” Eames snaps and stands abruptly, walking out before Cobb can get another word in.
~ He’s on top of the covers, while Arthur’s beneath them, but Arthur isn’t willing to bet on Eames’s apparently gentlemanly behaviour, seeing as Arthur definitely fell asleep wearing a shirt.
~ The thing about being a cat is that Jensen can't figure out the physics. He was 6'2, for fuck's sake, and now he's this tiny fluffy cat that only comes up to the top of Cougar's boot; where did the rest of him go? Man, if he comes back and his dick is gone, he's gonna be put out. "Hey," he says, "hey, hey, pick me up, damn it." Except it comes out chirping noises, which is really killing him because he sounds like something on Cute Overload, and he only knows about that site because his sister sent him pictures and sometimes stakeouts take too long and it'd just be weird to look at porn. "Can has rifle?" Pooch mutters.
~
Arthur frowned. “Excuse me if some of us like to be well-dressed and don’t want to wear”—Arthur gestured at Eames, apparently unable to come up with a word pejorative enough to describe his outfit—“that.” “I bet your suits look great,” Eames said. Arthur looked vaguely suspicious of this new ally. “I’m glad someone considers—” “They’d look better crumpled at the bottom of my bed,” Eames added. Arthur seemed paralyzed, unable to decide whether he was more horrified at the thought of sleeping with Eames or wrinkling a suit.
~
Arthur tries to sit up, and a bag of crushed ice falls onto what appears to be a large fleece blanket that has been tucked in around his shoulders. "I'm getting some mixed messages here," says Arthur.
~ Still, the wisdom of leaving a mafia family to a man named Dom Cobb was questionable. The phrase "Don Cobb" didn't exactly roll off the tongue, and "Don Dom" was even worse. "Don Dom Cobb". A travesty. Eames is mentally running through a list of acceptable Italian last names when Cobb snaps his fingers in his face. "Are you even listening?" asks Cobb.
~ "How am I supposed to protect him if he won't let me be around him?" asks Eames, and drains the rest of his whiskey. "Yesterday he got Yusuf to distract me with a plate of struffoli while he snuck out and went museum-hopping. There are so many things about that scenario that I find unacceptable." "You may begin listing them," says Cobb. "One, is Yusuf just trying all the recipes he can get his hands on? I mean, he's good at it, but I need to watch my weight," says Eames. "Two, museums? Security nightmare, but also, incredibly boring. And how many can you possibly stomach in a day?" "The sweets, or the museums?" asks Cobb. "The museums," says Eames. "The sweets, I could eat for the rest of my life. That's the problem. Anyway, three, you're not supposed to run out on your bodyguard. That's how you get killed."
~
"Saito has left to join Yusuf in opening a fusion-cuisine restaurant," says Cobb. "So the job is open." "But Saito can't cook worth shit," says Eames. "If he didn't have that mistress to depend on, he'd starve." "And Yusuf can only make dessert," says Arthur. "What kind of crap restaurant is that?"
~ "So you like it a lot, this building?" asks Eames. "I guess you could say that," says Arthur. "Why?" "I'm going to have to blow it up," says Eames, and pulls a handful of paper-wrapped packages from his pocket. "Come next morning, it won't even be ours anymore," says Arthur. "We'll blow it up. Under one condition, though. I'll do it. It has to be quick, before the bastards out there start calling for more soldiers. You don't know this building like I do, to set up a good chain. You'll take too long." "But Arthur," protests Eames. "Do you love me?" demands Arthur. Eames' head goes completely blank. "Uh," he says. "I mean— shit, I mean—" Arthur flushes darkly, and he crams the packages into his pockets. "I mean— do you trust me, is what I meant to— do you love— I don't even know you! I mean, I know you, but we're not even dating! I mean— that's not what I—" Eames swallows. "I'm leaving!" shouts Arthur, leaping to his feet. "Take out as many of them as you can, and run for the main gate as soon as you hear the first explosion. Fill my blind spots, I'll— I'll see you there, I— oh fuck me." And Arthur turns and practically flees.
~
"There's an ATM right there," Arthur points out. "It doesn't even have a line." 
"Machines are impersonal. I don't trust them," Ariadne said. She was digging in her purse for a pen. The check she was holding had little yellow ducks on it. Arthur raised an eyebrow at it. "What? It's from my mom." "I didn't say a thing," he said carefully.  "You didn't say anything very loudly."
~ "None for you," Ariadne scolded when Arthur demanded to know where his coffee was. "You get pain meds." "Eames has gone to get me the good stuff," Arthur said, smiling. "He's a true friend." "I know, we saw him raising hell in the nurses' lounge just now," Ariadne agreed. "He's already threatened to kill six doctors. He just promised his firstborn child to the nurse that ups your dosage."
~ “Don’t drip on my carpet,” Arthur commanded.  Eames looked down at his feet, at the pool formed around his soaked (and ridiculously bright green) sneakers. He looked back up at Arthur, meeting his eyes with some sort of studied intention that was lost in the general unsteadiness of his drunkenness. Then he looked back down at his feet and took a ginger step to the side, off the carpet. “M’clothes are all wet,” he informed Arthur.
~
“Shower. I know. I can find my own way, thanks,” said Eames, dropping the shirt into the pile of his discarded trousers. Arthur just had time to register the thought ‘tattoos’ before Eames swept, careening, back into the hallway. The soggy boxers hit the doorframe with a wet thump, thrown from the far end of the hallway. Arthur picked up the pile of clothes automatically, his mind still frozen on the tattoos, and went to put them in his washing machine. Then he went back to his room and pulled out a faded T-shirt (a joke gift from someone—Mal? Dom, even, back when he had a sense of humor?) with “Fingers are over-rated, explosions of awesome” written across the front. It was stretched enough that it would fit Eames, wider frame and all. Sweatpants, also old and stretched thin, would do for him as well. All this happened on a layer of Arthur’s consciousness that did not at all interrupt the metronome insistence of ‘tattoos’.
~
"But funniest thing, Arthur, you'll never believe my shock when my phone told me my mother was calling." "I bet you don't even have a mother, I bet you congealed from a pile of paisley poly-blends," Arthur said and then re-traced the conversation. "...wait, Eames. You—you didn't talk to my mother, did you?" "I couldn't just ignore her, now, could I? That would have been rude." "Oh god," said Arthur, covering his eyes with his free hand. "She invited me to New Jersey for my next holiday," Eames said smugly. "She said I sounded like such a nice young man." "That's because she doesn't know you, obviously." "She wanted to know if I could convince you to go home for Thanksgiving. Then she explained what Thanksgiving was, at length, and why it was important to be with family on that important family day," Eames said. "I was just home last month," Arthur said, his voice pitching dangerously close to the whine it reached when he talked to his mother for more than fifteen minutes. "I was home for three whole weeks. It was awful." "She said I wasn't allowed to let you say things like that about your family," Eames repeated dutifully. "You can't make me—" Arthur started to say but stopped himself just in time. "Eames. Never talk to my mother again." "I make no promises." "And give me back my phone."
~
He hacked into Arthur’s phone. He wasn't surprised to find the NYTimes or the phrasebooks (sixteen different languages with the phrase "I will shoot you if I have to" as the most frequently searched term) or, really, the app that just displayed the entire Periodic Table.
~ Arthur made the noncommittal noise that Eames had affectionately titled ‘Fuck Off #2: You're Annoying.’
~ "I'm not better than you," Arthur said. He liked to be accurate, though, so he added, "Better dressed, though. I am better dressed."
~ The other Arthur blinked slowly and his gaze settled on Arthur, the one glowering at him. "Bollocks," the other Arthur said. "I am going to kill someone," Arthur said firmly. He could feel a headache beginning. "I may even kill everyone." He pointed angrily at the fake Arthur. "I demand you get out of my body right now."
~ "I keep waiting for a good finale. Something I could walk away with."
"We don't get arcs, darling. You just fold your cards at some point and leave the table." Arthur made a sound that could have been an agreement or not.
~
"You always want unreasonable things from me," Arthur complained.
~ "I'm glad," Cobb replied, sounding like he'd rather chew nails. Arthur debated whether or not he should continue this conversation, but he decided that Cobb looked tired and they could talk about this tomorrow. But as he was walking away, he heard Cobb shuffle his papers and mutter, "I could have thrown you a wedding." Arthur stopped in his tracks. "What?" "Nothing," Cobb said. Apparently they were too manly to have this talk. "If it really matters to you," Arthur said hesitantly, "I guess you could." Eames was going to kill him for this.
[…]Eames was overjoyed. "I love weddings," he said.
~
Yusuf bounded up to them. "I get to be in charge of the wine!" he said happily. Arthur stared. "I'm thinking about introducing my own concoction. I've been experimenting with it, you see, and I think it's just about ready for public consumption," Yusuf exclaimed. "I am going to count to ten," Arthur said. "When I am done, none of this will be happening." "Hello everyone," said Saito. "And Mr. Arthur, I must offer you my sincerest congratulations. I have already spoken to Cobb. He says you might prefer to be married in your mother's house, but I've bought out a small island for the reception." Arthur walked away. "...no, really," he heard Yusuf explain. "Only one person passed out last time and he assured me there was a very pleasant fruity aftertaste."
~
Arthur stares at him, then places the tea cup back on the table. “I'm not sure what you think—” But Saito raises a hand and Arthur stops, obediently polite as always.
~
"All those in favor of dosing Arthur with NyQuil, and then sterilizing everything in the room," Ariadne says, with a look in her eyes that Arthur takes to mean that she would not be above doing this against his will, and then drawing a dick on his face when he passes out. In Sharpie. She raises both her hands, and he doesn't even have to look at Eames to know he has his up too.
"I hate you both," Arthur says, as Eames pets his hair. Eames pats his back, drags his fingers in soothing circles through the coughing spell that follows. Arthur’s throat is on fire, and mostly he just wants to die. He pants against the cotton of Eames' olive green slacks, and is in too much pain to properly insult them. "That's completely disgusting," Eames tells him, when it's finally over. He sounds pretty gleeful about it, though. 
~ "You could insult my mother and I would find it less offensive than your shirt," he adds.
~ He projects ‘do not come fucking near me and if you try to share my table I will strangle you with your own intestines’ in a way that usually works for him, but Cafe Lento must be attracting a more suicidal clientele today.
~
Arthur masticates scientifically-proven supernutritious wholegrains.
~ Arthur doesn't like drawing attention to himself. This is not a problem for Eames. He makes his way over, mentally rifling through a couple different options for what to say. He's going to try for phenomenally rude. 
~ Amy pauses. "Um," she says. "No. Because that would mean I was underage. And we are not underage." She presses her lips together. "At all," she adds, presumably for emphasis.  The tall kid rolls his eyes. "Come on," he says. "We should get back before curfew." He looks at Arthur, who is currently broadcasting concern and an aura of respectability. "The curfew we don't have."
~ "How is my godson?" Arthur asks, rolling back his shoulders to relieve some of the stress. "Still smaller than the three-piece suit you bought him for his christening."
~
"There are really a lot of other ways you could've explained it to make yourself sound less like an insane person," Ariadne offers. ~
"I am making sense," Eames says with something akin to exasperation. Although if it's Eames it has the potential to be fond exasperation. Hopefully. "Do try to keep up with the conversation." "I was sleeping, there was no conversation."
~ "I can’t believe you asked me in front of the Archbishop. Somewhere in the world my mother was appalled and didn't even know why."
~
"Fine, you are often wrong, but always charming and contrite. Except for those occasions when you're a sanctimonious, prescient arse." "I think that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me," Arthur says. "I hardly think that that—" "—if you include remarks about my Moleskine, my condescension, my lack of imagination, the funereal state of my wardrobe, the stick up my ass, and that one time you informed me I was so boring I could put the dead to sleep." "Your good memory is not conducive to our relationship." "You love my good memory," he says.  "Don't cloud the issue with facts," Eames complains.
~
“I'm in Tuvalu. Why am I even bothering to tell you this? Do you have a GPS tracker on me? I've discarded three phones. Is it embedded under my skin?”
~
“The original plan was to call me Henriette-Hortense, after my great-grandmother. But, as my father was not about to deny my mother anything in the moments immediately following my birth, that plan was abandoned and I am called Aurora.”
~
He leaned over his card to his partner, and lowered his voice to a whisper. “What’s your hand look like?”
“A Parched desert, Jean murmured, casually moving hisright hand up to cover his mouth. “How’s yours?”
“A wasteland of bitter frustration.”
“Shit. Have we been neglecting our prayers this week? Did one of us fart in a temple or something?”
~
“I suspect that drink has made you impulsive.”
“Drink makes me funny; the gods made me impulsive.”
~ “I like the cores,” said Jean sulkily. “All the little crunchy bits.”
“Goats eath the god-damned crunchy bits.”
“You’re not my mother.”
“True. Your mother would be ugly. Oh, don’t give me that look. Go on, eat your other core; it’s got a nice juicy pear wrapped around it.”
~ By night, they were an active crew of sneak-thieves, muggers, and coat-charmers. By day, they slept, diced, and drank away most of their profits. 
~ Locke drove the man out with a string of invective that made Jean (whose speech could be colourful enough to strike fire froma damp tinder) blush. 
“You friend is supremely unpleasant. I waive my fee, in profound sympathy. Keep your silver—you shall need it for wine. Or poison.”
~ Without warning, he dumped the ice-cold water in the  bucket all over Locke. “You needed a bath,” he interrupted Locke’s confused sputtering. “You were covered in self-pity.”
~ “You son of a bitch!”
“My mother was a saint,” said Jean. “The sweetest jewel Camorr ever produced. The city didn’t deserve her.”
~ “Unless the water of this fair city itself intoxicates, I’m as dry as baked sand.”
~ “To your health,” said Requin, raising the glass. “It needs all the assistance it can get.”
~ “And I correct you again. Difficult. ‘Difficult’ and ‘impossible’ are cousins often mistaken for each other, with very little in common.”
~
“Well,” said Jean. “I shall be sure to criticise your reading habits as well, should I ever see you develop any.”
~
“I detest both histories and biographies. For history, we are living in its ruins. And as for biographies, we are living with the consequences of all the decisions ever made in them. I tend not to read them for pleasure. It is not unlike carefully scrutinising the map when one has already reached the destination.”
~
“Gods damn it!” Locke yelled. “Let us out. You’ve made your point!”
“What point,” rasped Jean, “could that possibly be?”
“I don’t know.” Locke coughed. “I don’t care. Whatever it is, they’ve damn well made it, don’t you think?”
~ “I beg your pardon,” said Locke, adopting a helpful, slightly confused smile, “but I don’t know anyone by those names.”
“There must be some mistake,” said Jean, picking up Locke’s exact tone of polite bewilderment. 
~
“It’s amazing how much you an learn by buying drinks in artificer bars and pretending that every story you hear is incredibly fascinating.”
~ “We can rob nobles. We can do second-story work. We can slide down chimneys and slip locks and rob coaches and break vaults and do a fine spread of card tricks. I could cut off your balls, if you had any, and replace them with marbles and you wouldn’t notice for a week.”
~ “You are beyond mad,” said Locke. “Full-on barking madness is a state of rational bliss to which you may not aspire. Men living in gutters and drinking their own piss would shun your company. You are a prancing lunatic.”
~ “Oh, I was with you, remember? On the ground, keeping watch. I saw the bit with the pigeons. Hard to play sentry when you’re pissing yourself laughing. The three of you could have been legends dying so gruesomely. I’d have written a book about the man-eating pigeons of Camorr and joined the Therin Collegium. Gone respectable. I’d have built a statue to the twins, with a nice plaque”
“What about me?”
“Footnote on the plaque. Space permitting.”
~ “Dear God,” said Locke, “men are stupid. Protect us from ourselves. If you can’t, let it be quick and painless.”
“Well said.” Jean took a deep breath. “Crazy part on three?”
~ “I don’t care what you think you know, Kosta. Until further notice, we’re gonna presume that you’re too dumb to count to one.”
~ “Ravelle! I know you’re in there and I know you can hear me!”
He stepped up to the cabin door and shouted back through it. “Marvellous clever, Jabril. You’ve tracked me unerringly to the cabin in which I’ve been fast asleep and motionless all bloody night. Who tipped you off?”
~ “It’s a lock of my hair. Meant to give it to you days ago, but we got busy with all the raiding. You know. Piracy. Hectic life. Now, if you find yourself in trouble wherever you go, you can hold up that little bag to whoever’s bothering you, and you say, ‘You have no idea who you’re fucking with. I’m under the protection of the lady who gave me this object of her favour’.”
“And that’s supposed to make them stop?”
“Shit, no. That’s just to confuse them. Then you kill them while they’re standing there looking at you funny.”
~ “Hey,” said Locke. “Congratulations! We’re reverse burglars, here to give you fifth gold solari.” He tossed his coin purse at the servant, who caught it in one hand and gaped at its weight. In the next second and a half the man spent not raising the alarm, Jean coshed him.
~ “And of course I’ve heard of you. May I congratulate you on the completion of MacTaggert Wing?” The MacTaggert Wing was a terrible Brutalist monstrosity grafted onto the Sinclair Gallery, but it didn’t seem the time to air his architectural opinions.
~
She clutched her pass in her hand, and turned around to explain herself, and then utterly failed to do so, because the man behind her had stern eyes and sterner cheekbones, and wore his perfectly tailored suit as easily as breathing. “Er,” Charlotte said.
The man looked completely unimpressed. He had an iPad in one hand, with which he made a short shooing gesture. “This wing is closed for renovations,” he said dismissively. “I don’t know how you got in, but you need to leave.”
~
“You have a wedding planner?” the man said flatly. An affirmative noise could be heard from the phone. “What for?” the man demanded crossly. “You’ve been married three times already. Don’t you know how to do it by now?”
~
“Some things are better left to professionals.” His once-over of Charles made his opinion of Charles’ profession abundantly clear.
~ Erik looked so fantastically grim and murderous that Charles would laugh if he didn’t think that Erik would strangle him for it. “Forty-five minutes late, and everything’s waiting on him. That man is the devil,” Erik said savagely, and sipped his coffee with a scowl.
~ “What did the famous Erik Lehnsherr do today? Tell me everything,” Raven said, which might have been sarcasm except that she was pouring them both extremely generous glasses of wine and had never disguised the joy she took in Charles’ social flailings.
~ As it turned out, Logan had some admittedly excellent suggestions about crowd control in between horrifying Charles with off-handed comments about snipers.
“Really, Logan, I don’t think anyone’s going to assassinate Mr. Shaw,” Charles said firmly.
Logan raised an eyebrow. “You’ve met him, right? Ain’t nobody who’s met him that hasn’t wanted to kill him.”
~ “Perhaps you ought to tell me how you become an architect.”
“I earned my Masters of Urban Design from ETH Zurich,” Erik said. “And then I came here.” Charles smiled encouragingly, but Erik didn’t seem to feel the need to elaborate. Their order came then, coffee cups and some sort of cookies on twin stainless steel servers.
“And do you enjoy it?” Charles asked, before taking a bite of one of the cookies. He made a shocked, indecent noise at the combination of almond paste and raspberry and chocolate. Charles sipped his coffee to wash the crumbs down. “Am I allowed to ask you terribly clichéd questions, like what your favorite building here is?”
“The Citigroup Center,” Erik said blandly.
“Oh dear god why,” Charles said, entirely unable to help himself.
~
Charles thought for approximately five seconds about taking the rest of the cookies home to Ronnie, but he was sure they wouldn’t be as good at the end of the day, so really, he had no choice but to eat them.

The Pennington wedding was over, as was the retirement party, which was good, because the Shaw-Frost wedding went from minor shitshow to DEFCON HOT FUCKING MESS in the space of ten minutes.
~ “You promised me you wouldn’t freak out,” Charles reminded him.
~
“Bugger,” Charles said feelingly, and slid down the wall to sit on the floor. Surprisingly, Erik didn’t actually castigate him for getting into this mess, but he did tell Charles to shove over so that he could sit down next to him.
Which was fine, because Charles was plenty capable of castigating himself. “Why do I do these things to myself? I could be doing any one of the approximately six billion items on my to-do list, but no.”
~
“What are you still doing here?” Erik asked, looking as devastatingly delicious in his tuxedo as he had all night.
~
"My what?" Dick asked blankly.
"1098-T," Bruce repeated. "I need it for taxes this year."
"Do you even know what you're saying, or are you just repeating what your accountants tell you?" Dick asked.
~
“Well, I’m pretty sure it’s Loki, anyway.” “What, you don’t know? Was he short on the maniacal laughter or something?”
~ The response he gets is a groan. A vaguely curse-flavoured groan. Steve’s interactions with Loki have so far been largely limited to the hostile. He doesn’t know very much about him, beyond the fact that he’s Thor’s brother, that he’s not exactly nice, and that he can freely use the kind of magic that Red Skull would have murdered half the globe to get his hands on. That doesn’t sound like the kind of man who phones his enemies so he can groan at them. Steve briefly considers that this is part of some plot – it seems the likeliest answer – but if it is, it’s one flying so far over his head that he’s not even sure how to counteract it. It sounds like Loki is hurt. Wounded people, at least, are something he has experience in handling. “Are you injured?” More breathing. “…Alright. I’m going to take that as a yes.”
~ A voice comes over the communicator, now, strong and very sure of itself. The sort of voice that knows exactly how to hold the communicator and talk into it so that it comes across loud and clear, because its owner designed the things in a spare hour he was throwing around between a business lunch and a liquid dinner.
~ “My brother has spoken to you through the telephonic?” Thor booms through the communicator. “Truly, his aptitude for Midgardian technology is impressive! Though I can only speculate as to how he obtained your specific calling number. What game is he playing now?” “I’m not sure that it’s a game, Thor,” Steve replies. “He’s badly injured, and he can’t heal himself with magic. Is there some way for you to figure out where he is? I can’t seem to get him to-” There’s a fizzle, and then the little light on his communicator blinks off. Steve pauses, taken aback, and wonders for a moment if he broke it somehow. But then he hears something like thunder roar from the other end of his portable phone line, and closer by the receiver, Loki makes a sound that has suspicious similarities to a sigh of relief. A few dark clouds begin to gather on the horizon. There is the crunch of heavy, fast-moving footsteps, and a muffled sound of movement. He hears Thor say something – loud as ever – though the only words he can make out are ‘brother’ and ‘who would dare to’, and then there’s more thunder cracking, and a snap like something just broke. The line goes dead. Steve stares at his portable phone for a minute, and then decides that the situation is probably out of his hands now. He replaces it in his pocket, and tries to remember what he even went out for in the first place, before the phone started jangling at him.
~
Steve is eating lunch. So is Clint, though Clint has made it very clear that he is eating his lunch Over Here, Leaning on the Counter, and Not at the Table with Steve Because Tables are For Sissies Who Don’t Lean (as near as Steve can decipher it, anyway).
~ “Thor! You’re back. That’s good, Fury was won-” Steve tries, which is about as far as he gets before he finds himself enveloped in the sort of hug that threatens to crush even his ribs. The rest of his words get squeezed out of him like air from a paper bag, and he flails a bit, not sure if he’s trying to get free or just maybe sort of pat Thor on the back.
“My friend,” he says. “I am in your debt. If ever there is a boon you would ask of Mighty Thor, do not hesitate to do so.” Then he claps Steve across the back, once, and walks over to the fridge instead. “Have we any of those tiny cheese treats to eat? The freezer was replete with them ere I left.” Clint looks at Steve, and raises an eyebrow. Steve can only shrug in confusion. “What, no hugs for ole Hawkeye?” Clint tries. He’s given cause to regret it, of course, because then Thor decides to ‘favour’ him with one, and Steve snorts and settles back into his chair to watch Hawkeye squawk and then devoutly pretend that he didn’t just squawk at all, no, and having his torso crushed in a living Asgardian vice is nothing he can’t handle, except that it isn’t manly to display this kind of affection and for fuck’s sake, Thor, let go, and stop laughing dammit! Of course, a minute later Fury turns up, and then Thor’s being interrogated (which goes about as well as anyone could expect, particularly since Thor doesn’t even seem to realize that suddenly leaving for weeks at a time is a problem of some kind) and then Tony’s phoning in because some lunatic from China has just shipped crate-loads of animated warrior statues to a local museum, and they’re currently trying to murder anyone they can get their hands on. 
~ “What was the name of that restaurant we battled across from last month? You know, the one with the engraved window and the little outdoor dining section that your archer stuck like a pin cushion while he was trying to shoot me,” Loki asks without any preamble.
Steve’s mouth is operating on autopilot, so he hears himself say “La Rosa?”, because he remembers that fight, and the gigantic etched golden lettering (he’d almost got thrown through it, after all) and the name pops into his head before he can think to say something more relevant. Like ‘why are you phoning me?’ There’s a sound reminiscent of someone snapping their fingers. “That was it. Thank you,” Loki says, and with a ‘click’, the line goes dead again. Steve stares at his phone carefully. “Who was that?” Iron Man asks him. “Loki again,” Steve honestly replies. “He wanted the name of a restaurant.”
~
Steve gives serious consideration to throwing his portable (cellular, he reminds himself, it’s called a cell phone, except that he’s always worried he’s going to mix that up with ‘cellophane’ and come out sounding like an idiot) phone into the trash. But he doesn’t. Partly because it does serve an important function, and partly because he’s sure something like that’s expensive, and it was a gift, after all.
~ Steve doesn’t get anymore phone calls until after that’s all over. He does get one ‘text message’, though, which takes him a while to figure out. It looks to be in code, and reads: ‘gl w/amora lol ;)’ He sends it to the code-breaking team in SHIELD, but they just send it back to him along with a rather strongly-worded message about bad jokes and wasting project resources, so he decides not to do that again. The fourth time Loki phones, he asks for Steve’s opinion on drapes. “What do you think would look better on long windows, a dark green or a middle green?” Steve contemplates his phone for a moment before deciding on his response. “Dr. Doom’s castle curtains are a middle green, aren’t they?” “Point. Dark green it is,” Loki replies, before, of course, hanging up on him. A few minutes later he gets another message, which he thinks is a text message again, but which actually turns out to be a photograph of two windows. They’re adorned in dark green and gold drapes, which hide any possible view of exterior buildings or a skyline. Steve will concede that, as drapes go, they’re probably pretty nice. It would be better if he had any idea of why he was assessing Loki’s interior décor, though. The fifth call at least makes a little bit more sense. “You wouldn’t happen to know the SHIELD security codes, would you?” Loki asks. “No,” Steve replies truthfully. He’s not sure why they don’t trust him with that sort of thing, but frankly, he’s never asked, and he’s never much wanted to be burdened with it, either. “But I wouldn’t give them to you if I did.” “Ah well, it was worth a try,” Loki cheerfully replies, before hanging up on him again. Steve sends a message to SHIELD letting them know that Loki might be considering an infiltration project.
Some time after the sixth phone call (“Tell me, has the mortal capacity for musical innovation degraded over time, or has it always been this bad?”), the fourth text message (“l8test prnk on news, turn 2 CNN! :D”), and the second picture (a close-up of Loki’s new boots), Steve almost crashes into Thor when he goes to leave his room in the morning. The god of thunder is standing right outside his doorway. He’s… well, Thor doesn’t fidget. But if he did, then that’s what he would be doing. Somehow he manages to project an air of fidgeting, even with his arms folded and his expression tightened into something difficult to read. Steve blinks. “Thor,” he acknowledges, with a slight nod of his head, just on the off chance that Thor happens to be standing outside of his door incidentally. Or something.
~
“Yes. But. Well, look, if you’re going to ask me why, I’m sorry to say that I don’t really know,” he admits. “He did ask me for the SHIELD security codes once.” This is offered up with a certain amount of optimism not normally associated with attempted security breaches, largely because it’s the only thing Loki has done so far that almost makes sense. For Loki. Although Steve has been considering that this may be part of a masterful plot to confuse him. In which case, it’s too little, too late, because he’s spent pretty much the past year of his life being as confused as humanly possible, and he’s pretty sure that he’s reached some kind of threshold for it. ‘Confused’ is a near-constant state of being that no longer perturbs him now. It’s like combat. It never stops being stressful, really, but a man learns to adapt.
Thor’s brows knit. “Is he…” he trails off for a moment, and then seems to settle on the rest of his question. “Does he sound well to you?” Steve blinks. “Well?” Thor unfolds a hand from where it’s crossed over his chest, and waves it vaguely. “Healthy, sound, as reasonably sane as can be expected of him?” he elaborates. Steve considers this question for a good moment. Loki seems to spend a considerable amount of time and energy on killing Thor, or ruining Thor’s happiness, or turning Thor into small animals, or breaking Thor’s possessions. But Thor, he has noticed, is not the kind of man who takes that sort of thing personally. Even when Loki starts shouting about how he very personally he hates Thor on a personal level, directly relating to Thor’s person. 
“He doesn’t usually talk for very long,” Steve decides on. “But apart from that first call, he’s seemed fine.”
~
“Do you have any idea how many times I’ve been pregnant?” Loki asks him one evening, after the Avengers have just finished dealing with a group of formless black shadow monsters which Dr. Strange had informed them were below his skill level and not worth his considerably valuable time, but still probably ought to be dealt with before they disemboweled anyone. Steve raises an eyebrow, and hopes that’s a trick question. “None?” he hazards.
~ “Your brother’s been pregnant?” Thor blinks. Then he opens his mouth. Then he closes it again, and, looking vaguely embarrassed, shrugs. “We did not think the horse would actually catch him,” he says. Steve decides right then and there that he doesn’t want to know. He just does not want to know.
“Sure is windy up here,” Steve interjects. “Do you ever feel the wind in that tin suit of yours, Tony? At all, I mean? Or is the interior of that thing heated, somehow?” Tony and Thor take the hint – probably because it’s delivered with all the subtlety of a brick to the head – and Steve makes a mental note to steer any further lines of conversation well away from Loki’s love life. And Tony’s. And also possibly Thor’s, just as a precautionary measure, because he’s not sure but he seems to recall hearing about at least one cross-dressing myth in his childhood, and… well, there are some things that are better left unsaid between friends.
~ “A good spar,” is what he says, though, clapping Steve on the back with enough force to almost send him tumbling down again. “Yeah,” Steve grits out. Then he sucks in a breath, and lets it out again, gingerly stretching out his muscles and feeling what hurts. The answer is, unsurprisingly, ‘everything’, but the pain is already starting to recede.
~ Tony swears. “I hate fighting this son of a bitch!” “Watch your tongue, my friend!” a familiar voice booms at them from overhead. “That is also my mother you speak of!” “Right, sorry,” Tony acknowledges, before waving pointedly towards Loki. “Go, smite, wrath of the gods, you know the drill.”
~
“You have vomit on your shirt,” Eames offered by way of a greeting before shouldering his way in and dropping his travel bag on Tony’s sofa. Tony picked up the bag and tossed it back at the man.
“I don’t know what you think you’re doing here but you’re definitely not staying.”   
“That’s hardly friendly.” Eames looked him over critically and frowned. “You look terrible.”
“Thanks. It’s my impending unemployment look.”
~
"Oh, god, coffee," Mike says, and instantly upgrades Sam from tolerable to decent.
~ She hugs him tightly. The part of him that reacts to being on edge is telling him that he needs more space to move, that Kon should be in the front and to the side to provide a shield without impeding movement, that Cassie should be at least 5 metres away so she can make better use of her lasso. 
~ "Bart keeps saying how you're the only one that doesn't make him feel smart, which we're trying not to take offence at—" "It helps that he forget to put the ice-cream away the last time he did a food-run, so we ended up with two gallons of raspberry vanilla all over the floor."
~ "He calls himself 'Green Arrow'. The guy doesn't even have any powers, and you know what he uses for weapons?" Cougar studies the picture on the screen and wonders if this is a trick question. "Arrows?" "Yes! Dude, he's fighting modern criminals with automatic weapons by using tech straight out of Sherwood Forest. I can't figure out if the yahoo's incredibly stupid, or just really into cosplay." Jensen leans back and crosses his arms over his chest. "He's gonna die, man. I mean, if it was that easy to be a superhero then every... body... would..." Cougar blinks and quickly turns his attention towards the techie. He knows from experience - bad, bad experience - that when Jensen trails off in the middle of one of one of his rants it's because he's gotten distracted by something. And the only thing that can distract Jensen, besides shiny objects, are the scary thoughts that rise up Lovecraftian-like from the dark recesses of his mind. Those thoughts have been known to lead to violence, bloodshed, and on one memorable occasion a really kick-ass, but terrifying, weekend in Vegas.
~ "The cops still have that clown sicko," Jensen says, "but some other guy has already shown up, to, I don't know, fulfill their nutjob quota or something. He calls himself Killer Croc." Pooch snorts. "Let me guess, he has pet crocodiles that he's trained to rob banks." "Uh, no. He looks like a crocodile, and he eats people." Clay wearily rubs a hand over his face. "Of course he does." "He comes after me, and Jolene's getting a new set of luggage," he says, gesturing so emphatically coffee sloshes over the rim of his mug. Cougar purses his mouth thoughtfully. "I could use some new boots." Jensen swallows his last bite of doughnut, and scowls. "Could we maybe postpone the whole skinning criminals talk until after breakfast?"
~ Jensen uncaps one of his erasable markers, takes a deep sniff - it's blueberry scented - and starts writing. "Superman. Wonder Woman. Aquaman." He turns to survey his class. "Can any of you tell me what these monikers have in common?" The other Losers share bewildered glances. Pooch opens his mouth. "That was rhetorical," Jensen says sharply. "I'll tell you what they all have in common; they're all lame." He uses the marker to tap on the board. "Superman? Wonder Woman? Come on. It's ridiculous." Clay slaps a hand to his face. "You're worried about sounding lame?" he asks wearily. "Yes! It's all about perception, guys. The public needs to think we're cool, and villains need to know we're not to be messed with. Imagine if I'm called Computer Man. Would you guys fear me? Would you think twice about going up against me in a fight, or causing trouble in my neighbourhood? No. And you know why?" Pooch opens his mouth again. "That was also rhetorical. Because it sounds dumb, that's why." Jensen writes D-U-M-B on the whiteboard and circles it. Then circles it a few more times for good measure.
~ “Actually, from my research, I think Batman is very territorial about his city, so the chance of us professionally running into one of Gotham's villains, outside of the Tailor's shop, is relatively low." Pooch simply stares at Jensen for a long moment. He then reaches over and smacks the back of the blond's head hard enough to displace his glasses "Ow!" Jensen fixes his glasses, and gingerly touches the back of his head. He glares at Pooch. "What the fuck was that for?!" Pooch is unrepentant. "What did you just say?" "What'd you hit me for?" "What did you just say, Jensen?!" "I said..." The blood drains from Jensen's face as he replays his earlier words. "Oh, crap." "Uh huh." Pooch puts his hands on his hips. "So, what are our chances now, Jinx?" "Um, there's no scientific proof that saying something won't happen means the universe will make it happen." "Yeah, and there's no scientific proof that saying words backwards causes them to come true, but it sure as hell works for that magician lady with the fishnets and the awesome legs." Pooch holds up a hand and takes a deep breath. "I am going to go inside, and call my wife, and coo at my little boy, and try and suppress the fact that we are most likely going to meet some horrible, awful, undignified demise tomorrow while getting fitted for our spandex supersuits. Jesus Christ. Fuck my life."
~
"I apologize in advance for the chick flick-i-ness of the next few moments, and I promise we'll do something suitably John McClane-ish to make up for it, but I gotta know what this is. Are we fuck buddies, or teammates with benefits, or... is this the start of something, you know, more? 'Cause I'm okay with anything, really." He shakes his head. "And wow, did that sound pathetic." Cougar huffs out a laugh. "I would... be happy with whatever you are willing to give me." Jensen's face lights up. "Seriously? You're serious?"
~ "Motherfucker!" Jensen braces his arms against the 'fridge and, using his not inconsiderable upper body strength, he pushes back against his assailant while at the same time twisting his body around to break the hold. Jensen ducks and pivots and is on the other side of the room, arms up in a defensive posture and ready to throw down, when he realizes just who had broken into their little hideout. "Oh, my God," Jensen says, blinking rapidly. "Can I have your autograph?" It's Batman's turn to blink. He recovers more quickly than Jensen. "Who are you?" the vigilante growls. "Why are you here?" "I'm Jensen, and I wanted a beer." Batman blinks again, and Jensen can't help but feel a little proud of himself.
~
"Clay, you said it yourself. We're dead. We were incinerated. There was nothing left but bones and teeth, and, as far as we know, only Aisha was psycho enough to count them." Jensen holds up a hand and flashes a smile towards the frowning little nutjob. "And, by 'psycho', I mean you look really pretty this morning."
~
"Awww." Pooch, wide-eyed, slaps a hand over his mouth. "I did not just make that sound," he says from between his fingers. "You can't prove it, and I will deny everything."
~ "You love me," she says with complete confidence.
~ "I know this guy back home," Cory offers, and Chris groans. "He's not losing his virginity to a Canadian," Naya says. "It's like having an out of town girlfriend in high school, no one will ever believe him when he tells that story." "Can we stop talking about my virginity?" Chris speaks up, and Darren reaches over and pats him on the back.
~
"Now is the perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone," Lea says. "There should be a better saying for that, I don't like thinking about dead birds." She frowns a little to herself.
~
"You...you threatened him!" Barbara said indignantly.
"No. I enlightened him, rather like the Buddha of implied violence." Dresden sighed. 
~
Must weigh a fucking ton and Eliot has no idea how the guy wielding it - and yeah let’s face it you don’t wave a sword like that around, you own it and fucking wield it with attitude - can hold it so easily.
~
“Nobody said cuddle,” she says. “You said cuddle. I said ride like a trick po—”  “YOU'RE SIXTEEN.” “Seriously, what was being sixteen like for you?” she asks doubtfully, and Wally has to concede the point, because yeah, he would've said the same thing when he was her age.
~
“Not my fault the guy's got abs I could bounce a quarter off,” he says.  “He's Kryptonian, you could bounce a boulder off his abs! People have!” Wally squawks, although the dreamy look Dick gets at that makes him think it didn't really help.
~
Batman makes a sound that's probably supposed to be a laugh. It makes all the hair on Superboy's body stand up and sends a chill down his spine.
~ There's a rush of air and a blue blur and Superman is there. "Ma," he says, "Ma, I can explain."
"Mrs. Kent is Superman's mother," Batman says, as if Superboy hadn't just figured that out, and though only one corner of Batman's mouth twitches, Superboy thinks he might be smiling.
~ Barry has good intentions. They lead him directly where good intentions typically lead.
~ Bruce offered a cheerfully silken threat, hung up the phone, and went down to the kitchen, where he found Alfred making dinner with an amused smile and Dick and Superboy arguing over someone's math homework at the table as if the situation were all perfectly normal. “Dick,” he said disapprovingly, folding his arms.  “He knows our secret identities,” Dick said quickly, giving him an embarrassed grin. “So, uh. No take-backsies?”   “I must say, Master Bruce, Master Dick's turning out to be a marvellous older brother,” Alfred commented mildly, and set out tea like another man would draft a declaration of war. On principle, Bruce dialled up the disapproval.  “I am! I totally forged him a birth certificate and a history and everything!” Dick put in eagerly, fishing a thick file out of his backpack and holding it up like a prize. “Cover's completely aster. Mom lost custody and went to jail, deadbeat dad, extended family can't afford to take care of him. And, uh, if anyone asks he was born in Russia and that's why he doesn't know much American pop culture.”  “And if someone asks him about Russian pop culture?” Bruce asked, eyeing both boys darkly.  “We're crash-coursing that,” Dick replied sheepishly, half-hiding behind his folder. Not that it mattered, because he wasn't wearing his mask in front of Superboy, and no one else looked surprised by that at all. “But it's way less likely to come up than American.”  “And when someone expects him to speak fluent Russian?” Bruce raised a pointed eyebrow, expression just darkening.  “I do speak fluent Russian,” Superboy said awkwardly, which was a momentary surprise—then again, Bruce thought, why wouldn't Cadmus teach him more than one language? Superman protected the entire planet, not just bits and pieces of it.
~ "No!" John quickly denied, too quickly really. He knew it was a mistake as soon as he'd said it, but then he'd never had been a good liar. Especially in front of Sherlock. "Never met him before in this life!"
~ “I’ve read about people like you in newspapers,” Arthur announces flatly, still holding his magnifying glass. “You’re a predator.” “I can see how you might draw that conclusion. But those people would be standing in the open instead of trying to hold a very prickly tree branch over their privates,” Eames says. “Also, those people wouldn’t want someone to fetch them a pair of pants. I, on the other hand, would very much like a pair of pants. Maybe even a shirt.”
~ Neal appeared to be having a silent conversation with Mozzie, consisting entirely of tiny head jerks, hand twitches and facial tics. Whatever the outcome, Mozzie wasn’t pleased.
~ Batman is looking at him with slightly narrowed eyes that anyone else would be likely to find intimidating, but which Robin knows well enough to interpret as Batman's 'what is the appropriate way to respond to people who are actually remotely normal' face. Batman wears that face a lot around Robin. Not as much as he used to, when it was Bruce hovering around Dick in the mansion and you could just see the poor guy going ‘oh Jesus Christ it's a kid what do kids even do what do I do, why is Alfred smirking and refusing to help,’ because adopting circus orphans on a whim is a pretty good reason to panic, as it transpires. But that look still crops up every now and again.
~
On her way out of the car, teetering in these stupid heels, Cougar cranes his head back to murmur, "Hey." He makes the symbol for 'eyes on', 'I'll be watching you like a creeper', and to Jensen's disgust she relaxes inside. Then Cougar says, "You look nice." She tells him to fuck himself and closes the car door, smiling.
~ “I mean that Dr. Desmond appears to have gone to quite a lot of effort to make it clear to you that you are not a real being,” Red clarifies.  “I'm not,” Superboy says, automatic.  “If you know that, why did he bother telling you?” Red asks, and Superboy frowns. He knows that because Desmond told… wait…
~ Batman’s ways, Lois was fairly sure, mostly involved dangling people off high buildings and over highways. Clark had assured her that this wasn’t (always) true, but he had been doing that thing he did when he lied where he wouldn’t look her straight in the eye.
~ "Goddamn idiot kids," Dean grumbled to himself as he uncapped a bottle of Oban with his teeth. "It's the solstice! Let's all hang out at the cemetery and animate the dead! Why the fuck does anyone ever think that's a good idea?"
~
“Hey.” Dean made sure his balance was functional and nodded at dream-Castiel, who naturally did not return the greeting. “You got anything you wanna tell me?” “You require a haircut.” Castiel intoned this like most of his pronouncements.
~ "Are you having existential career angst?" Peter asks. "Did you come here to mock me?" Neal replies, taking one of his fries. Peter stabs him in the hand with the dull point of his chopstick.
~
"New interns," Neal mutters. Peter watches them go. They are, to a one, remarkably attractive. "Do you pick them based on head shots?" he asks. "Well, I need a little joy in life," Neal replies.
~ “You can't dedicate a gallery to yourself in your own museum,” Peter said, the day Neal brought the renovation blueprints into the office and spread them out on the conference table for everyone to look at. “Just for that, I'm offering Jones the security chief job instead of you,” Neal replied, while Diana studied the second-floor plans. “I think he can,” Jones put in. “Suddenly you're a museum expert?” Peter asked, amused. “I don't like to brag, but I was recently named head of security for a prestigious local museum,” Jones answered.
~
"It's like a band-aid," Peter says. "Pulling it off fast is best." "You have no soul," Mozzie tells him. "I find I travel lighter without one," Peter responds, and Elizabeth giggles just as the door bursts open.
~ “I’m a private investigator from Chicago—” “Oh, Lord. She told me she was done with the credit fraud!” “I don’t know anything about that,” said Dresden carefully. “A few days ago, I had a guy contact me about a girl he helped out.” “What’s his name and how old is he?” “Confidential, and he assures me it was strictly platonic. Considering he’s dating a hockey player named Tim, I believe him.”
~ "No more dragons," he says to the ground. "Please tell me dragons aren't real," a voice that is not Castiel's says. "We really don't need to add dragons to the List of weird crap we have to deal with. Like the randomly appearing people in the gate room." Dean slowly sits up and wants the dragon back. There are twenty guys with automatic guns pointed at him, and four armed-but-not-currently-threatening-them people staring bemusedly at him. Dressed in fatigues. With weird symbols on their uniforms that Dean's never seen. "Hi randomly appearing people in the gate room. Whatcha doin'? "Uh," Dean says, blinking. "Not making any sudden movements?" "That's...a refreshingly good idea," Silver Haired Leader Guy says. "And you?" he asks Cas. "Lower your weapons," Castiel says in his low growly Do Not Fuck With Me voice. Predictably, that makes all the gun wielding people remember they have guns and shift them to make a point.
~
"No. It is an alien." 
Dean blinks. "The illegal kind?" Dean asks. "I am unfamiliar with the immigration procedures of non-Earth born humanoids," Castiel says. ~
Harry managed a bitter laugh. "Firstly, if I hadn't left, they would've tossed me out on my ear eventually. As it was, when I finally took off on my worldwide sightseeing tour, my magic was already starting to give them all the creeps."
When it became obvious that Harry had nothing further to add, the man laughed. "Dude, you're supposed to follow up a 'firstly' with a 'secondly'."
"Oh. Right. Well…" Harry pretended to ponder for a minute. "Secondly, it's none of your business."
~ The thing about hunting was that there was a lot of downtime, a lot of hurry-up and wait—for the sun to set, for the moon to be in the seventh house, for the people in the apartment to leave so they could break in—and over the years, they'd each developed their own ways to combat the boredom of sitting around and waiting to kill things: Sam generally chose reading, and Dean generally chose disrupting Sam's reading.
~
"Oh, the joy, to hear once again your dulcet tones!" Eames crows over the phone, and Arthur can hear shouting in the background. "I'm looking for a Mr Eames, I hear he's sometimes sober. You couldn't by any chance put him on?" "Very funny, darling. And the answer is yes." "I think you're doing this out of order." Arthur tries to keep the smile out of his voice. Eames chuckles. "You always have the best jobs. How could I turn you down? Now quickly, give me a place and a time, I have a bar fight to start."
~ Arthur tells Eames exactly what he wants to do to his latest shirt (it involves fire, lots of fire) and Eames responds by describing what he wants to do with Arthur's tie (Cobb chokes on his drink).
~ "We need to celebrate with alcohol." Eames announces firmly.
~ "Darling," Eames says when they break for lunch, taking Arthur to the side and putting on his most deliberately offhand expression "I never was one for all that workplace relations rubbish, but you probably have policy books in gilded frames on a wall somewhere, so I'm just going to check." He pauses, and takes a breath. Arthur realises with shock that Eames is actually nervous. "I'd rather like to do that again sometime. And was wondering if you felt the same way." "Very much." Arthur says. Eames lights up, and steals his pen before going back to work.
~ "He's already instufferable," Sam says conspiratorially, and then bites his lip. "Can you take me to get pizza?" "Maybe. I'll ask your parents."  Sam nods. "And can you show me how to explode a helicopter?" Arthur considers for a moment. "Maybe. Again, though, I'll have to ask your parents." Sam looks enormously pleased, and when Eames emerges a few minutes later with a tiny backpack dangling from one had, Sam is hanging off Arthur's wrist talking a hundred miles a minute about his third-best-friend's birthday party and why it wasn't his fault about the (very, very small) fire, but maybe partly his fault that they used the garden hose inside and by the way do you know kung fu?
~ "How do you watch hockey ironically?"
"You got me, brother. I'm just reporting the facts as I am told them."
~ "She's not my sidekick. I don't have sidekicks. She's my protégé."
"Whatever you say. I know a sidekick when I see one,” says Bucky.
~ “Just once,” Eames says, “I wish you’d let me come round when I’m not in mortal peril.” “Don’t be so dramatic,” Arthur says dismissively.
~ “I wouldn’t have gotten you shot.” Eames lets out a deeply unflattering snort. “Far be it from me to question your professional pre-eminence, darling, but the four gunshot wounds I’ve sustained in your company would beg to differ.”
~ “No plans yet. Why?” Eames says. “I warn you, I’m rubbish at body disposal.”
~ “You’re significantly less funny than you think you are,” Arthur says.
~ “She’s thinking of faking her own death, you know.”  Eames snorts. “Family time going that well, then?” “Evidently. I told her it’s more trouble than it’s worth. Frozen bank accounts, and all.” “Come now, it’s not so terrible being legally dead. No fussing about taxes and such.” “I file a tax return, actually,” Arthur says absently. “Or, Henry Gondorff does. I might need the paper trail someday.” “You are the most tragically straight-laced criminal in the entire world,” Eames says. “Do you donate your ill-begotten gains to charities for legless orphans, as well?”
~
"I've been on my feet all day," Arthur announced. Yusuf made a sound that could just as easily have been ‘stop whining’ as ‘I feel for you, man’ and Arthur would much rather it was the latter.
~ "Darling, I thought of you the minute I saw it," Eames said. Arthur rolled his eyes. "I'm touched, really." He tried to force all the sarcasm in the world into that sentence. "Because of your name, see? Arthur? Like a knight?" Eames continued, undaunted. He picked the figurine of the knight up and pointed to the head. "He has your eyes, too." "He's an inch tall," Arthur pointed out. "He barely has eyes." "Still. He's making the same face you make all the time. The one where you scrunch your eyebrows up," Eames said, looking intently at the figurine. "The face you're making right now, actually." "He's fighting a dragon," said Arthur. "I could see how we might have the same emotional experience right now."
~
Yusuf continued to make obscene gestures that were somehow disturbingly specific and anatomically improbable.
~ Arthur was very aware of the fact that he hadn't gotten laid in ages and if he was dating Eames, this was the most Victorian relationship he'd ever been in. Plus, there has to be a conversation, at some early stage, when both parties become aware they're dating, right? You can't be dating and nobody told you, right? The fact that he was wondering whether he had accidentally begun to date Eames was one of the many things that was entirely Eames's fault.
~
"We have three days,” Saito says calmly. “Including today." It’s already noon, so Eames can sympathize with Arthur’s deepening frown. "But you need five days," Saito says slowly, and then nods. "It will mean a significant change of arrangements. Difficult, but not impossible. Perhaps some kind of … transportation strike." They all watch as Saito pulls out his cell and begins giving rapid orders, possibly shutting down entire travel networks.
“That’s a little scary,” Eames says finally. “Right?”
~ "Don't open your eyes, Mr. Eames." That was Saito, sounding calm and reassuring. It appears one person knows exactly how Eames will react to that, because there’s a series of unexplained oofs and a hand drops firmly over his eyes before they open even a sliver.
"Which part of 'don't open your eyes' was unclear?" Arthur sounds very close and very irritated and that's far more reassuring than anything else could possibly be – Arthur’s only annoyed when he has the leisure.
~ It's part of Yusuf's hypnogogia experiment. If you open your eyes, he's not exactly sure what will happen."
Not quite awake, not quite asleep: the desert of the prophets. "Now that sounds interesting," Eames says with sudden enthusiasm. Ariadne's small hand promptly covers his eyes and, from the sudden sound of shuffling and muffled groans, she made it a split second before at least two of the others. He’s touched - sort of - and evidently rather predictable.
Behind them the train carriage door slides open with a mechanical hiss. "Have the hallucinations started yet?" Yusuf asks cheerfully.
And the enthusiasm dies an abrupt death. "No one mentioned hallucinations," Eames says quietly and, he feels, given the circumstances, heroically calmly. "What hallucinations?"
"You'd have had them by now if you were going to," Yusuf says breezily. 
~
“I thought we agreed that you would stay out of my head.” 
The pause is long enough for John to think that Sherlock hadn’t heard him when the other man speaks, “Then stop thinking so loudly.”
~
John goes on the defensive, “I wasn’t brooding.” Sherlock raises an eyebrow and goes back to tuning his violin. “Don’t make me quote your thoughts. We both know that you hate that.” ~
“I see you’ve witnessed one of my brother’s attacks,” Mycroft begins. John stares and shrugs his shoulders in a kind of helpless gesture, as if to say, ‘I guess. If you’ll tell me what that is.’ He has been doing this gesture a lot recently.
~ There is an awkward silence, heavy in the air. John feels as if he should say something sympathetic, but Hallmark doesn’t exactly sell cards that say things along the lines of, ‘Sorry you read too many thoughts. I hope your brain is okay.’ “It would be an interesting customer base for them to try out,” observes Sherlock. “Readers are severely unrepresented in the marketplace.” John does not need to remind Sherlock to stay out of his head.
~
"What are they doing in my sock drawer?"
"What all socks do I expect," Eames says, looking at Arthur over his newspaper. He had just finished his eggs and was halfway through his coffee when Arthur stormed into the kitchen, brandishing the socks in hand. "Generally laying about in a bundle with other socks."
"These are yours," Arthur continues, tone an accusation. “I’ll ask again, what—”
"Being a very small part of a long-running and all-encompassing infiltration campaign," Eames says, eyes back on his paper. When he risks another glance up, Arthur is looking at him, open-mouthed.
~ Eames shrugs and then picks up something small and plastic that he sets down immediately when Yusuf makes a distressed noise. "Speaking of which, do I need a decontamination shower for touching that?"
"...No?" Yusuf says, but he doesn't sound very sure and Eames sighs.
~ That gets Arthur looking up, one eyebrow raised. "Is that some cutesy English way of asking if I want to have sex?"
"How'd you know that?" Eames asks.
"I assume everything you say is some cutesy English way of asking for sex," Arthur says with a half-shrug, standing.
~
He feels Arthur glaring at his back for a few moments before he seems to give it up. "Just stay on your side," Arthur eventually grumbles.
"Both sides are my bloody side," Eames grumbles back.
~
"You said that we owned three pro...pur...proper...places together," he finally manages after a few false starts. "I need to know which ones so I know how much you care. If it's any of the places in France, then I know you don't give a shit because you hate France." Arthur gets his feet under him enough that he can tilt his head and look at the bottom of Eames' chin. "Why do you hate France?"
"Many and varied reasons, mostly to do with the efficiency of their police force," Eames says. "But please, do continue. This is fascinating."
"But if it's the place in Alaska-"
Eames freezes, drops his hold on Arthur who stumbles a little forward but stays mostly upright. Arthur turns slowly, holding his arms out sideways for balance. "How do you know about the place in Alaska?" Eames asks slowly. No one is supposed to know about the place in Alaska. "That's where I go if someone wants me dead."
"That's why I know about it," Arthur says, shrugging. He raises the hand not holding his beer and squints at Eames, squeezing thumb and forefinger together about where Eames' head would be in his vision. "In case I wanted you dead."
~
"Trust me."
"You know I do," Arthur says and Eames blinks at him because that he really didn't.
~ “If dislike is the opposite of like, is disaster the opposite of aster?”
~ She hated him with all her might. He’d called her hair red, in front of all those people. And, yes, she was a redhead, but she didn’t spend her years working her way up the social ladder to be called that now. At her rank, her hair was auburn. 
~ “How much is nine times six?”
“It is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency requiring the fathoming of it hath not in my life-days occurred, and so, not having need to know this thing, I abide barren of the knowledge.”
~ “What’s your real name?” Arthur had asked him once.
“Please,” Eames had answered, smirking at Arthur. “That would be like giving my social security number to a common thief.”
“So you have a social security number?” Arthur asked triumphantly, smirking right back.
“Eames does,” responded Eames, or the man who went by that name. Whoever had done up Eames’ identity was very good. The man had an unpaid parking ticket in Des Moines. He belonged to a bowling league there too. He’d made a noise complaint against a neighbor once, which was the least believable thing about the whole package.
~ “I memorized Wikipedia last year just in case something might come in handy.”
~
"So you need me to pretend to be your boyfriend," Arthur says. Eames nods glumly. "You do remember that I am, in reality, your boyfriend, right?" Unlikely that Eames forgot, considering the enthusiastic welcome he's given Arthur when he walked in.
~ In the living room, Osoba grins at him briefly before her face smooths back into a blank expression. Kinsey looks apprehensive. Arthur slouches into a corner, glaring at everyone indiscriminately.
~
“He could do all my teleconferences.”
“And what would this simulacrum of you do when it is unoccupied?” asked JARVIS.
“Uh, me-things. You know... things I do when I’m bored.” A telling silence. “Yeah, okay, that would be a bad idea. Have I congratulated myself on how smart I made you, JARVIS?”
“This is the two-hundred and thirty-seventh time, sir.”
~ He ignores the warning look from Arthur that means, judging from prior experience, that Eames is likely going to end up bent over the counter with Arthur’s forearm across his larynx if he doesn’t quiet down in short order. Out of self-preservation, however, he does prudently jump ahead to the point.
~ “Neighborhood trick-or-treating starts at six, but you’ll have to go early to make sure they’re dressed and have their shoes on,” Cobb continues. Arthur starts to reach for the pad of paper on the counter, presumably to take notes, and then visibly stops himself. Eames has to cover his mouth and scratch his nose to hide his smile, which he doesn’t do a very good job at, judging by the way Arthur throws the pen and hits him squarely between the eyes.
~
“You can’t see my eyebrow, but rest assured, it is quirked at a disbelieving angle.”
~
Clint’s voice drifts out of the other room. “I’d be flattered he’s even offering. When one of us needs a ride all he does is bitch.”
Tony shouts back, “I’m not your own personal airplane!”
“I was falling forty-nine stories!”
“And whose fault was that?”
~ ‘Kid’ is still a hazy concept, but he’s definitely got the age narrowed down to ‘younger than me, old enough to drink’ which is fair enough.
~
She unpacks gauze and bandages, and then a suture kit. “You know what you’re doing with that?” Tony asks. She stares at him.
“Tony I’m fairly sure everyone in this building knows more about field medicine than you do, so just let me work, okay?”
~
Tony puts a not inconsiderable amount of effort into propping the wall up and holding it there. Spider-Man is a blur, moving around him and webbing the cracks. Tony lets go, gingerly, and the wall holds. Spider-Man makes victory arms. “You are a ridiculous human being,” Tony says. “Spider human being.”
~
“See?” Spider-Man says. “Dr. Banner thinks it was a good idea.”
Tony says, “Yeah, but Bruce has also been known to… let’s just say his scientific methodology has been known to need work.”
“My methodology is fine,” Bruce argues. “My testing practices have been a little non-standard.”
~
Neal got a shifty look on his face, one Peter recognized as his 'I'm about to say something that's going to upset you' look.
~ But Arthur is special; he buys suits in Milan, speaks at least three languages, and gives the impression of being able to kill someone by staring at them hard. He also reads books with dragons on the covers, and occasionally drinks Mountain Dew. He’s a paradox, a nerd wrapped in Armani with a shoulder holster made of Spanish leather. Once, Eames swears he heard Arthur singing along to Billy Joel. He has never let Arthur live it down.
~ “ARTHUR. I’M IN DUBLIN. GOD KNOWS WHY. I’D FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH ALCOHOL IS REQUIRED TO PUT UP WITH THIS FUCKING WEATHER. SAVE ME.”
~ “Arthur, light of my life. Sorry to have left you hanging, I was a bit indisposed. Actually, I’m still a bit indisposed. Actually, I’m hoping you can pick me up. Can you track me down with some of your fancy phone gadgetry? I’m missing my wallet, my shoes, and my memory of the last several hours, and would appreciate a ride.”
~
"No, no," Yusuf says faintly, "it's just my retinas, wasn't using them for anything anyway."  "It's like…it's like a train wreck," Ariadne whispers. "Oh, god, Yusuf, help me, cover my eyes, I can't look away."
~
There are several outcomes of The Incident of Which We Will Never Speak or Think of Again, Not Ever--No, Ariadne, Not Even for Blackmailing Purposes (Yusuf's phrasing, Cobb's Important Capitalized Emphasis). The first, obviously, is that Cobb considers going back to therapy, but then, like always, he remembers how it went with the last therapist. And the one before that. And the one before that. Cobb knows he isn't crazy. He just wishes everyone else did.
~ "Also," Eames adds, reading the sign, "since when do you refer to yourself as the management?"  "The only thing I've ever seen him try to manage is my life," Arthur mutters viciously. Cobb would be hurt by this, except that he knows Arthur is just lashing out because of the tough-love conversation they'd had following the display that had started everything. To be fair, that conversation had consisted largely of Cobb saying things like "THINK OF MY FRAGILE EMOTIONAL BALANCE, ARTHUR," at increasing volumes while Arthur made frustrated noises into the phone. Arthur is his least grateful child, and he stands by that. The fact that Arthur is not actually his son is immaterial.
~ "She's sixteen," Ariadne points out. "And her father's a mob boss running at least four blackmailing operations, on top of everything else--there's a good chance she's going to get kidnapped at some point. We might as well be the first. Teach her to be more aware, too."
~
Jayne looked shifty. “She’s a reader. Knows what a man wants.”
“He’s very robust,” River volunteered.
“Why do you people insist on thinkin' I want to know this?” Mal complained, catching Simon mid-lunge and swinging him back to the other side of the corridor.
~ "No time to explain, we must find Arthur," she said, hurrying out the door. Then she remembered in what company she was in at the moment and hurried back inside, took the machine gun out of Eames's hands, and said, "Not that kind of emergency, just...it's a thing, alright?" He shrugged. 
"Suppose I won't need these either?" he asked nonchalantly, pulling a Glock out of one pocket and a hunting knife out of the other.
~ Interrupting all this unspoken communication is Eames, saying, "Excuse me as I reiterate, but, what the fucking fuck." ~ ~
Some gallows humour makes it funny for Arthur to see everyone in the room who is not him, or possessed by a demon, jump and go for his or her gun automatically when Dean calls through the door, "Open up!" Paranoia, Arthur thinks, is a beautiful thing.
~
"Arthur, what the fucking fuck," Eames begins. Arthur holds him off with one finger held up, the universal one second sign.
~ “Precisely the reason I married my first wife in Iceland,” Saito plays with the ring on his finger. “And the second in Calgary. My third wife and I wed in Hong Kong, or at least the plane was flying over it. My fourth wife, of course, insisted we orbit the Earth.” Ariadne stares at him. “That’s a lot of divorces.” Saito furrows his brow. “Divorces?”
~ Eames spends the entirety of Arthur's twenty minute monologue staring at his mouth. Arthur finishes with, "So, any thoughts?” "Yes," says Eames. "You really should wear your hair loose sometime." Arthur closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose. "Any relevant, legitimate thoughts?" he tries again.
~
“Minus another fifty,” Arthur says, not looking away from his notes as he brushes it aside, “for being dramatic about it.” “I like a come from behind victory,” Eames says, making the words as filthy as he can.  “That’s looking really unlikely,” Arthur says, “seeing as you just lost another fifty for creeping me out.” “He’s in a temper today,” Yusuf says, crossing the room with his arms full of bottles of excitingly bright and terrifyingly bubbling liquids. “He took thirty points from me for not bringing him coffee. Like that’s my job.” He rolls his eyes. “Minus another twenty,” Arthur says imperiously, though there’s a lurking smile in his voice, “for impertinence.”
~
“I am familiar with twenty-seven different languages, John; that garbled sound you’re making is not one of them. A more common vernacular, if you please.”
~
"Guys?" Ariadne said. "I think I might throw up." "Outside," Arthur and Eames instructed simultaneously. "I'm never speaking to you again," she told him, leaning her head heavily on his shoulder.  "Absolutely," Eames agreed, rubbing circles into her back soothingly. "Feel free to be sick on Arthur's shoes." Arthur took a hasty step backwards out of the splash zone. 
~
“You’re the only one who catches me when I try to pickpocket them,” Eames remarks fondly before producing several wallets from his jacket. “I was thinking I could plant these on someone.”
~ "Don't take it personally," he told her, "Cougar's just adjusting. There's a difference between wanting someone and accepting that it's not going to go anywhere because you think that person isn't attracted to your gender, and wanting someone and knowing that it's not your gender, it's you.” He shook his head and rubbed his hand over his face. “And that's all the girly shit I can take today.,” he grumbled. “I'm gonna go drink beer and play with guns now.”
“Oh,” she said to the space where he had been. “So he's just a fucking moron. That explains it.”
~
“I hate him,” she said, glaring.
“I don’t think that word means what you think it means.”
~ “Oh, God,” moans Cobb, “Please, please stop talking about this. I don’t want to think about what you two do in your spare time.” “Spare alone time, I think you mean,” says Eames. “Adult alone time.” Cobb glares, the one that sends little children running. Eames smirks wider. “Naked adult alone time. With my– ” Cobb flees.
~
“You are such a goddamn liar,” Rahm tells him, casual as you please because when you grow up in Chicago and hang around politicians, some things are par for the course.
~
“Excellent.” There are papers being shuffled in the background and Arthur wonders how much blackmail material Rahm had prepared in event he continued to refuse. Arthur is certain it cannot be as much as Arthur has on Rahm. Thirteen year old Arthur's Jewfro was pretty terrible though. “Deliverables by the end of the day Thursday.”
~
"Darling, danger is my middle name," Eames said, smiling. Arthur frowned at him. "Your middle name is William," Arthur said, cocking his head to one side. ~
Arthur lets Eames stare. Lets his eyes rove over Arthur's face looking for gaps and untruths and ulterior motives. He won't find any. There are none. He can see the change in Eames' demeanor when he realizes this. And then Eames steps in, closing the gap between them. "I'm going to snog you now, so if you have any objections I'm afraid it's too late to voice them." Arthur stops him with a hand on his chest. "I do object," he says, leaning in and pressing his lips against the corner of Eames' mouth. "I want to kiss you first."
~
When Eames came home not with bagels and milk but with a kitten, tiny and grey and purring, he tried, desperately, to name him François, but Eames just smiled down at the little bundle of fur and said, “Nothing so stuffy for you, right, Mr. Cuddles?” To Arthur’s extreme dismay, the cat hadn’t responded to anything but that ever since.
~ “You’re the best friend I’ve ever had.” Tim said that like – like ‘the sky is blue’ or ‘nobody likes brussel sprouts’. Like a basic, immutable fact of the universe.
~ "If they beat you up for it, shouldn't you stop doing it?" "Why would I do anything they want me to?" "Because pain is bad?" Sam was looking at him like he was possibly an idiot.
~ Tim always texted like that, with complete sentences and actual punctuation.
~
"I was waiting for this game to come out when I died," Bart told him. 'This game' was Super Mecha Attack DX Gaiden, and Bart was beating the pants off him at versus mode. Kon loudly blamed the fact the game was in Japanese, but there was really only so much translation 'giant robots and girls in short skirts' needed. "After we got back from the future," Bart continued, "I picked it up from the bargain bin for fifteen dollars." 
"Heh," Kon said, "unexpected bonus." Bart backed him into a corner, and Kon gave up on finesse and started button-mashing as fast as he could. "Space doesn't have corners, man," he complained. "I've been to space. There are no invisible walls in space!" 
"Wait, stop," Bart said, "try your specials. Hold green and hit purple." 
Kon tried it. Bart killed him anyway. "Oh, you motherfucker," he growled. When Bart just laughed like a super villain, Kon stuck him to the couch and grabbed him in a headlock. 
Kon's phone started playing Enya at him, making Bart cackle. He managed to get it out and open without letting Bart go, but it took some effort.  "Yeah?" he said. He held the phone against his ear with his telekinesis, and used his newly free hand to pummel Bart with a couch cushion. 
"Are you busy?" Tim asked. 
"Nah, man. Me and Bart are fighting giant killer robots."
"What a coincidence," Tim said. He sounded slightly short of breath. There was a muffled boom somewhere on his end, and the tinny sound of distant screaming. 
~ There was a pause in which Kon heard typing. "Hey," he said. "I don't hear any bats." 
Tim's voice was dry as fucking bone. "Contrary to popular belief, none of us actually live in the Cave." 
"So where are you hacking my computer from?" 
~
Tim smiled one of his normal boy smiles. It matched his normal boy clothes too perfectly to be real.
~ "Well, you’re here kind of early, aren’t you? Did you even go to bed?" 
"The jet has an autopilot," Tim said, which shouldn’t have been an answer, but probably meant that he was running on about an hour of sleep. He turned on the TV and did something that replaced The Breakfast Show with a top down view of the Lowell County autopsy lab. Kon could only assume the body on the table was Matt’s, because it was under a sheet. A man in a white coat and plastic apron walked into the field of view, pulling on a pair of long latex gloves. "Oh good," Tim said. "They’re about to start." 
"Look," Kon said, "we all have our specialties. You call me when there are giant robots to break. I call you when someone’s being dissected. Division of labor. It totally works." 
~
Kon laughed as he turned to look – and stopped abruptly, because, yes, that was definitely flirting going on over there. Kon knew flirting when he saw it, and he was seeing it now, between Ma and some guy in coveralls and…that just wasn’t right. 
“Your face,” the kid said, with obvious delight. “Oh, god, that was worth the drive out here. I guess your aunt doesn’t date much?” 
~ Clarence just turned and walked away. Delilah said something that earned her a detention and made Cross go red in the face. 
~ Kon shuffled his feet uselessly. “I could…maybe ask Ma to feel him out?”
Jake stopped messing with the machine and turned to look at Kon, slightly panicked. 
“Or not. Um.” Apparently this was one of those conversations where the other party was meant to offer sympathetic noises and not advice.
~ "No," Bart said, "I mean that's illegal!" Everyone, including Tim, turned to look at him, and Kon felt the couch start to buzz as he went on, "Under the Federal Equal Access Act of 1984, US Code Title twenty, chapter fifty-two, subchapter-"
"We get it," Cassie interrupted. 
~ Kon blinked. "Who sues superheroes?"
"Well, in 1952, the city of-"
"Hypothetical!" Kon dropped back onto the cough with a thump and frowned. "I don't even know any lawyers."
Bart made a noise of frustration and crossed his arms over his chest. "Only because they wouldn't let me take the bar exam." He paused - long enough for Kon to register it as a pause - and then he was gone.
"Huh," Cassie said. "I guess he thought of-"
Bart was back, sitting at the table opposite Tim and surrounded by books and stacks of papers which fluttered in his wake. He was bent over a yellow legal pad and writing furiously, clutching a bunch of spare pencils in his other hand. "I've never written a Letter of Demand, before. This is kind of fun!"
Kon saw Tim sniff, and tested the air himself. He smelled smoke, and looked around in alarm until he tracked the scent to Bart's pencil sharpener and the growing pile of shavings under his chair. When he concentrated, he could hear brief bursts of wood-chipper whine whenever Bart turned a page. "You're not a lawyer!" He protested.
~ He smiled a hard little smile and looked up at Kon, and Kon couldn't help but return it, because he knew that smile, and it meant vengeance from on fucking high.
~ Jake's gaze cut to the side, over toward the chicken-house. "Does your Aunt know?"
"Know what?"
Jake looked back at him, incredulous. He shook his bag of paintbrushes. "About-"
"Oh!" Kon said. He opened the door and stuck his head into the living room, where Martha was knitting something Superman-blue. "Hey, Ma. I'm starting a support club at school for gay kids. Jake's helping. Do you mind if we take over the kitchen?" 
Behind him, Jake made a strangled little sound. 
"Go ahead," she told him. "I've just got a stew on. There's lemon cake. But don't you ruin your supper!"
~ Tim picked up on the first ring. "Would you care to explain why my lab is full of dirty gym socks?" he asked by way of greeting.
Kon sat down on the bed. "Because clean ones would be useless for a DNA test?"
~ "Conner Kent!" she shouted as he flew off up the stairs. He heard her fuming as he stripped and started the water, and then she shouted up the stairwell, "I wish Clark had given you a middle name!" ~
Then the kid smiles widely at the compliment and Sam finds himself melting because that’s Dean’s smile.  Only more bright and open, more innocent, and Sam feels the sudden urge to protect this little boy from all evil, with his life if necessary. And he understands his father for the first time in 22 years.
~ “I’m starting a petition to save The Avengers because Joss Whedon made it and I love it so I assume someone wants to take it away from me.”
~
“As an avid Joss whedon fan, I spent most of The Avengers waiting for it to be abruptly cancelled.”
~ “My local theatre has replaced a unch of Avengers showings with with some movie called “Sold Out”.”
~ “Hey, McKay, why don’t you and Teyla go check out the power source? I’m going to go see how Keras is doing. Ronon, you . . .” John looked over at Ronon and the five children already clinging to him and said, “you just keep up the good work, buddy.”
~ "Oh wonderful, now she’s repeating herself." Sherlock glared at Anderson. "Congratulations, Anderson. You actually performed the first case of human-to-human transmission of stupidity."
~
Sometimes Pepper thought she wasn't paid enough for this. (Then she remembered she was CEO, and could give herself a raise.)
~ "Tony wanted me to make sure you're not a supervillain." "Way too much work," Mike replied. She smiled. "I can see why he took a shine to you. All right," she added, putting a StarkTech tablet in front of him and offering him a stylus. "Keep signing your name until it tells you to stop." "Should I be a little worried I don't get to read it?" Mike asked. "Absolutely. To assuage your worries," she said, and tapped a finger at the top of the screen. "That's your salary."
~ After about ten minutes of fighting, one nondisclosure contract, and two threats of tasering if he got out of line, Mike got to meet Captain America.
~
"Harvey's my personal lawyer. He makes would-be babymamas get DNA tests, runs off the grifters, and administers my personal estate. He's not actually Satan, but he's probably related. Scary effective."
~
He was allowed to come along to the meetings on sufferance; mostly, the idea that if Stark couldn't bring his assistant to meetings, everyone would suffer. As Stark put it, "Thor gets to bring Mjolnir, and Mike's at least twice as smart as a hammer." Only Mr. Fury (scary in a kick-your-ass way) and Mr. Coulson (scary in a ninth-grade-math-teacher way) really objected, and while they were truly terrifying the Avengers tended to outvote them when it came to "Oh god, just let Stark bring him, it shuts him up."
~ Mike tilted his head. "I think this is the point at which, if I were a woman in a movie, I'd get to throw a drink in your face."
~ "If you ever fuck off without telling me where you're going again, you're fired," he said, as soon as the doctors were gone. "I'd fire you now but you're probably all traumatized and your grandma would kill me."
"I fuck off without telling you where I'm going all the time," Mike pointed out.
"I'm trying to express affection here, it's very difficult, shut up."
~ "Right. And you remember everything. Fuck." Tony rubbed a hand through his hair, rising to stand at the edge of the bed, looking down. "We didn't know you were gone until Jarvis told me your GPS was deactivated." 
"How'd you find me?"
And now Tony looked...guilty.
"I might have installed a second chip," he said.
"You what?" Mike demanded. "I'm a person, you don't install things in me!"
"It was a deadman chip, cyberbiology. Totally undetectable and inactive –runs on kinetic energy," Tony babbled. "You would never have known it was there. It only activates when your pulse rises enough to power the chip—"
"You installed a GPS that would only activate if I was tortured?"
"Well, it did the job!" 
"Oh my God, if I weren't all traumatized and grateful to you and probably suffering from Stockholm syndrome I would quit so hard," Mike said. 
~ "So are we talking some extremist splinter group?" Natasha asked. "Al Quaida the next generation?”
"Canadians," Fury answered. There was a long silence.
"Like...from actual Canada? That's not some kind of codename?" Clint asked finally.
"I got kidnapped by Canadians?" Mike demanded. 
"Well-armed US citizens recruited in the cause of a terrorist cell that happened to originate in Canada," Coulson corrected.
"I got kidnapped by Canadians," Mike said to Tony. 
~
"Yeah. Tony said, keep him out of trouble," Darcy said with a laugh. 
Mike set the calibration scanner down. "Jarvis," he said.
"Yes, Mike?" Jarvis asked, all innocence.
"Are the Avengers on a mission this morning?"
"That information is above your SHIELD clearance level."
"Son of a bitch," Mike said. "That son of a bitch."
"Mike?" Darcy asked, but Mike had thrown himself into a chair, rolling across to a monitor.
"Can't talk, busy plotting Tony's death," he said, fingers flying across the keys.
"Hacking into SHIELD's mainframe is illegal," Jarvis reminded him.
"Are you gonna stop me? Because I'll unplug your server, Jarvis, I swear to God."
"Merely reminding you of safe protocol," Jarvis said sulkily. 
~
"It's the least-traveled airspace in the hemisphere. Rhodey and I used to go there when I was training him on War Machine."
"So if I fuck up, I fall into the Atlantic and die?"
"Don't be ridiculous," Tony said. "If you fuck up you fall into the Atlantic and I fish you out and mock you forever."
~
Mike reached up and popped his helmet off, and Spider Man flinched, covering his eyes.
"Hey, warn for spoilers!" he said, frantic.
"Yeah, like word's not going to get out by the end of the week anyway," Mike replied.
~
"You have what they want. The best job in the world. And a billionaire boyfriend who will build you a robot if you want one."
Pepper frowned. "Why would I want a robot?"
~
When Captain America walked into the newsroom, all work ceased. You could have dropped a pin in the silence. He wasn't even in uniform. He did have his shield on his back, but that went with him practically everywhere. Still, Steve was aware he had the tendency to loom. Tony always did tell him he should take more advantage of that. He loomed over the entry desk.
"Jameson," he said. The terrified-looking receptionist pointed over her shoulder. "Thank you," Steve said, because anger was no reason to be ill-mannered, and stalked on. Jameson was just emerging from his office, probably to shout about how quiet it was, when Steve arrived at his door. "Mr. Jameson," he said, still looming. He was starting to enjoy this. 
~
"How long's it been since you slept?"
Arthur blew a stream of smoke out between his lips, then said, in all seriousness, "I don't know. What day is it?"
Eames stared at him. "Thursday." A blank look. "The thirteenth," Eames clarified.
~
Arthur held up two fingers. "One," he said, "Only doctors have to swear the Hippocratic oath and you know it. Stop making up oaths. I thought we got past this when I swore the blood oath to be your BFF forever--which was repetitive as well as pathetic, if you think about it, because we all know what the second "F" stands for, you giant girl." "I was twelve," Dom pointed out like that changed, in any way, the girliness of the impulse. "And it was a blood oath. Between men. Very manly stuff." "To be BFFs," Arthur repeated. "You giant girl." Some things needed multiple repetitions.
~
"If I go back to my dorm, I will have to murder my roommate," Ariadne said, flopping onto one of the bar stools. "I will murder her and I will hide the body and no jury will ever convict me because she is a horrible human being." "I thought you said you'd hide the body?" Arthur said, not looking up from the glass he was polishing.
~ "What's that to me?" Eames asked with a ridiculously obvious fake shrug. Even Pug could tell he was playing a hand with no cards.  "Then I don't suppose you'll make a fuss if we take him along with us right now," Pug suggested.  "We'll put the kettle on," Wheezy agreed. "Make him a nice cuppa." "Honestly, it's like you're parodying yourselves," Arthur said. "You're not frightening anyone, you're just making tea sound completely unappetizing. And anybody could do that, it's tea."
~ “I know we've had our differences, but did you put out a contract on my life?” Eames sounds out of breath, as if he's been running.
“No?” Arthur says, puzzled, realizing that the rising inflection is conveying the opposite of certainty.
“No?” Eames echoes. “That sounds suspiciously like 'yes', Arthur.” Eames trails off, and Arthur hears something like gunfire in the background. A lot of gunfire. “Must dash! Call you back.”
Arthur had started to think he was going to have to send up smoke signals. Possibly by burning Eames' London flat to the ground. So he'd made a few calls. (A lot of calls.) Casual enquiries. (A thorough and methodical search of all Eames' known contacts.) Just to let people know he wanted to talk to Eames. (Badly. Very badly.) Perhaps he'd sounded a little desperate. (He may have promised money and favors in return for information, or better yet, Eames.) In retrospect, Arthur can see how his actions might have been misinterpreted.
[…]“You accidentally put a contract out on me?” Eames sounds sceptical. “I can't wait to hear this one, Arthur.”
“I only said I needed to talk to you!”
“Ah. Depending whom you spoke with, 'talk to' can mean very different things, many of them unpleasant. Who did you tell that you wanted to talk to me?”
“They were people on your contacts list!” Arthur reaches for the list of names. “Obasi.”
“Nigerian mafia.”
“Chiumbo.”
“Kenyan mafia.”
Arthur winces. He can see where this is going. “Yuri Chernenkoff.”
“Also known as 'The Terror of Tomsk.' Russian mafia. Next?”
“Takashi.”
“Oh, the Yakuza. This gets better and better. Go on.”
“Ray Holtz.”
“I thought you'd know Holtz. Ex-CIA triggerman; now does wet work pretty much exclusively. Anyone else?”
“Mikayla Hryhorenko—” Arthur stumbles on the pronunciation.
“Yes, it's horrendous and has too many consonants. I know who you mean. Ukrainian assassin. At least she likes me. Most of the time.”
~ “Also, I was forced to take an unscheduled swim. You now owe me one custom-tailored Cerruti suit—two piece—silk shirt and tie, a new pair of Oxfords, brown, and a limited edition Silver Anniversary Glock 17.”
~ “I just wanted to talk to him! Why does everyone think that means 'kill'?”
Arthur can hear her contempt over the phone. “Because no one phones me to find someone they want to talk to. I'm an assassin.”
~ He takes a step closer, but doesn't reach out yet. “I don't want to presume.”
She licks her lips and sounds a little breathless when she instructs: “Presume.”
~
“You seemed pretty upset. You want me to find you a downer?” he asks. “This is L.A., it’ll only take me five minutes.”
~ “Oh, fuck you,” she says.
He shrugs. “Got a wife for that.”
~ “Dude,” says Pooch. “I drive things and you’re a hacker. Our parts in the crime and mystery have always kind of been stupid.”
~
Clay blinks. “I thought you went dancing,” he says.
Jensen waves her fingers vaguely and Aisha says, “We went dancing, and then we went drinking, and then we offended some men because we drank more than them.”
Jensen holds out her arm: there are twelve hash marks in purple Sharpie and a frowny face. She doesn’t know quite what the frowny face actually means, but she basically threw up a gold necklace into the bushes at one point before they stumbled back into the safe house so she’s assuming someone threw down the Goldschläger gauntlet. And she hates that shit. It’s like chilled German urine and then they add cinnamon.
“Fucking Nazis and their Nazi gold,” she mutters.
“The men then insinuated that we were perhaps not interested in their sexual company,” Aisha continues gamely, “because we appeared to be—what was the word?”
“Dykes,” supplies Jensen as she presses her face into the cool Formica table. It feels great.
She nods. “So I replied that we were not but we were merely not inclined to have a sexual congress with apes…”
Jensen pulls her head back up and points at her eye. “And then one dude punched me."
“I then punched him, Jenny smashed a beer bottle over a second assailants head, and that was when the brawl started. We left before the bar caught on fire though,” Aisha finishes.
~
“Did you fight Nazis in that bar last night?” he asks, going back to the fridge.
She joins him. “No, but I’m going to start telling people that. That’s awesome.”
~
“How is the seduction going for you?” asks Aisha at breakfast a week later. 
“Hasn’t started,” says Jensen. “I’m working on a strategy.” Aisha, very clearly, rolls her eyes. “Hey, it’s gonna be a great strategy,” she defends. “Like, fucking ironclad. He’s totally going to love me back.”
~
"I can't take you to Venice," he told the kitten. "It doesn't speak English," Eames pointed out.
~ “I just had a half an hour conversation with a contortionist,” he had a slightly glazed look about him. “I don’t remember a word she said.”
~ "Do you ever have one of those days," Damon says, "where you just want to slaughter everyone in the whole world?" "Yep," Elena says, placidly turning the page. "I call them Mondays."
~ Amos smiled and kissed her gently. “That’s stupid.” “Well, I’m glad my concerns are so trivial.”
~  “How did Brad put up with your ass for so long?” “Please don’t think about my ass.” Nate mumbles despondently.
~
"She's pretty," he says, slowly. "She has regular, symmetrical features and long blonde hair and she weighs less than average, and she dresses beyond her means but she has a good relationship with her bank so they'll keep extending her line of credit. But you--" he stops, starts again, "you're not pretty. But you look kind. You look warm and clever, and people--you don't even notice how people gravitate to that because they've always done, they like you, of course they do, you make it easy, and then you go and you--you do something like smile or laugh, or something ordinary and stupid and pointless and--"He can’t meet her eyes. "And I can't breathe."
~
She's tall and willowy with legs right up to there, and she orders an apple martini. 
"Just so you know, I want your legs in a totally platonic way," Joanna informs her, gesturing.
~
“We have come to demand the name of your new lady! A duel will be held for the right to your affections!” Thor exclaims, looking extremely excited at the prospect. “I will be Tony’s second,” he adds when Steve stares, completely bewildered. “I know that you and I would not think to challenge a lady,” Thor says, completely misinterpreting Steve’s confusion, “But Jane has informed me that here you honor women by treating them as equals capable of fighting their own battles.” The last is said earnestly and somewhat stilted, as if he was a child repeating a lesson learned by rote.
~
"You should probably sit down," he says, helping her to a chair and hoping with every step he didn't just create some kind of diplomatic disaster by touching a queen.
~
Neal nods and smiles his con man smile, the one that shows too many perfect white teeth, and Peter tries to ignore the warning bells that go off whenever he sees it.
~ "Nothing you need to worry about," Neal says, which is the opposite of comforting as far as Peter is concerned.
~ In Century City, Jensen says, admittedly kind of loudly, “I should just get him hammered and fuck him and have his baby. Then he can never leave me. He’s the kind of guy who just couldn’t do the deadbeat dad thing, you know?” A woman in a pink Chanel suit looks at her in horror. “But that’s my in case of emergency plan,” Jensen adds. “What’s your plan?”
~
“So can you get me Anderson Cooper’s number?” Eames laughs. 
“I’m not a Vanderbilt, you moron,” Arthur says, shaking his head.
“But?”  “Yeah, I have it somewhere,” Arthur says.
~
“That must be my Aunt Augusta. Only relatives and creditors ring the doorbell in that sort of Wagnerian fashion.”
~
“The only way to behave towards a woman is to make love to her if she is beautiful and to someone else if she is plain.”
~ “How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins, when we are in this horrible trouble, I can’t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.”
“Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner,” Algie responded, his mouth full. “The butter would probably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them.”
“I say it’s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the circumstances.”
“When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me. Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink. At the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy. Besides, I am particularly fond of muffins.”
“Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that greedy way,” said Jack, grabbing the plate of muffins. 
Algie offered him the cake platter. “I wish you would have tea-cake instead. I don’t like tea-cake.”
“Good heavens! I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own garden.”
“But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.”
“I said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances. That is a very different thing.”
“That may be. But the muffins are the same. 
~ “You should be nicer. Haven’t you ever heard the phrase ‘you attract more flies with honey than vinegar’?”
“Horse manure attracts more flies than both and I’m not interested in that either.”
~ Then, once he’d eaten, he would ask the spirits for guidance. Their guidance was pretty useless, but the company would be welcome.
~ “What is the meaning of this?” he roared, all bluster and bravado. “Do you know who I am?”
Glen snorted. “Of course we know who you are. Do you think we are in the habit of snatching people from the street at random?”
~ The mage was not in the least what Logan had been expecting. A gaunt, pale, sickly looking young man with dark rings round his eyes, long hair plastered to his head by the drizzle and a nervous smile. He seemed more wet than wise, and certainly didn’t look powerful beyond the dreams of men. He looked mostly hungry, cold, and ill. 
~ His hair was plastered to his face. He rolled onto his side and coughed phlegm onto the ground. “Aargh,” he croaked. He coughed and spat again. “I will die. I will die, and then I will not have to move.”
“We’ve got no food, so if we stay here you really will die. Then I can eat you and go back over the mountains.”
~ “Do you know his sons?”
“Better than I’d like.”
Brandon nodded. “They’re absolute shit, aren’t they?”
~ “My father will be displeased! That my men must wait outside the gate shows little respect.”
“But I have so little, Prince Caldor,” said the wizard calmly. “Please, don’t be downhearted, though, Your last messenger wasn’t allowed over the bridge, so you see we’re making progress.”
~ “It’s mending well. You’re a fast healer.”
“Lots of practice.”
~ “Golly. How many potted plants does it take to spell ‘Loser’? If this turns out to be a suicide we’re investigating, I can’t say I blame the guy. Alright, so what do you want to inspect: the empty answering machine or the letters addressed to Resident?”
~ “It’s tea…leaves of a certain plant, boiled up in water. It is considered quite a luxury. Would you like to try it?”
Logan sniffed it suspiciously. “Smells like feet.”
~ Logan threw his sword down, point first. He had it in mind that it would bite into the soil and stand there, swaying back and forth, but it toppled over and clattered against the dirt. It was that sort of day.
~ The room was opulence itself, near as big as a barn. This carving on the high ceiling was caked in gold leaf, the spines of the books on the shelves were studded with precious stones, the monstrous furniture was polished to a mirror shine. All was oversized, over-embellished, over-expensive. Bu t who needs taste when you have money?
~
He threw himself down in the chair, moving with none of the grace one would expect from an important historical figure.  ~
The boy scowled up at them as though they stank worse than a pair of fresh turds. Daniel wouldn’t have been bothered, except he’d washed specially for the occasion. Hadn’t been this clean in months. 
~ “He said he’d open the gates –what was his phrase— ‘when God himself commanded it.’ Do you have a divine intervention planned?”
~ “They say he led some charge or other.”
“Did he now?”
“They say he killed a score of men on the battlefield.”
“Only a score?”
“They say he bedded the Emperor’s daughter.”
West snorted. “Somehow, I find that the most believable of the three.”
~
He trailed off. It had seemed a simple enough idea to him, but now all eleven bureaucrats were staring at him, shocked, as if a new domestic pet had been ill-advisedly allowed into the room and it had suddenly decided to speak up on the subject of taxation. 
“Ah, your Majesty,” ventured Torez in soothing tones, “Such a system would be almost impossible to administer.” And he blinked in a manner that said, ‘How do you manage to dress yourself, give your incredible ignorance?’
“The subject of taxation,” droned Holland, “is a stupendously complex one.” And he gave Jacob a look that said ‘It is far too complex a subject to fit inside your tiny fragment of a mind.’
“It would perhaps be better, your Majesty, if you were to leave the tedious details to your humble servants.” Martin had an understanding smile that said, ‘It would perhaps be better if you kept your mouth shut and avoided embarrassing the grown ups.’
~
Gavin glared at the long feather in the hat and the gold basketwork on the hilt of Costa’s sword. “I thought we said inconspicuous.”
“In…con…spicuous?” He frowned, then shrugged his shoulders. “Ah, so that was the word. I remember something was said, and I remember I didn’t understand it.”
~
“My men? Unreliable? Nonsense! Why, there’s not a man of them I wouldn’t trust my mother to.”
“Are you sure?”
“She’s been dead twenty years. What harm could they do her now?”
~ Teresa and her father were engaged in what appeared to be a heartfelt argument, carried out in expressive Spanish, accentuated on both sides by violent hand movements. Jacob might have been relieved that he was not the only family member she appeared to despise, had he not suspected that he was the subject of their argument. 
~ “Are you always drunk by this time in the morning?” she asked scathingly.
“Your Grace, you wound me,” he replied with an easy grin. “Usually I have been drunk for hours by now.”
~ "Whoa!" Dean said, his face lighting up like Christmas had come early. "Bullets actually work on these guys? Awesome!"
~
“Do you want to find him or do you want to argue?” He growls, deliberately looming over her.  She refuses to be intimidated. “I see no reason why we can’t do both.” He steps around her and stalks off, calling out behind him. “Then keep up.”
~
“We went and got some cupcakes. And we ate them. God help us, we ate them all. And then we decided to have a sit-up contest to offset the calories. And now the cupcakes have been transformed from delicious baked treats to a roiling ball of hatred in my tummy.” 
“So what you’re saying is that you didn’t save me a cupcake and you’re terrible friends, and I shouldn’t feel bad for you at all.”
~ Eliot brushed his hair back off his face and measured the distance between the closest vehicle and the glass of the first floor. "I could hot wire a car and ram the building." "A little drastic," Nate told them. "Especially as I already vetoed Parker's blow up the elevator shaft suggestion."
~
Had anyone asked her opinion on Eliot's ability as a lover, Sophie would have told them that she expected he'd be as competent at sex as he was at any other physical activity. As it happened, it was a good thing no one had ever asked because Sophie hated to be wrong about people and "competent" came as close to describing Eliot in this instance as "predictable" came to describing Parker at any time.
~ "What's the hold up, Alec?" Alec rolled his eyes at the impatience in Nate's voice. "Well for starters," he muttered, gaze flickering over the code filling the screen, "this system was designed by a chimp in serious need of some Ritalin. There's more wires in here than in Sophie's lingerie drawer." "I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that,” Sophie called out.  "And for seconders," he continued as Eliot snickered in the room below, "the information we need is in a couple of hundred different places and this lot's a little shaky on the concept of sub-directories. We're talking Hunt for Red October here, people, I'm rummaging through the Atlantic trench for information that's running silent and deep. But…" He hit save, unclipped his input leads, and closed the briefcase holding his equipment. "…lucky for us all, I am Sean Connery and Scott Glenn all wrapped up in one much smarter package." "Hunt for Red October?" Eliot asked as Alec set the ceiling tiles back in place. "Sub-directories." "Yeah, I got that, but Tom Clancy's not science fiction." "I refuse to be confined by genre expectations."
~
“Oh, she’s cute. I already have a girlfriend, but I was thinking, for you—”
“Please, don’t ever do any thinking for me.”
~
“The questionnaire wants two adjectives to describe your partner. Hmm. Bag. Douche.”
“Neither of those words are adjectives.”
~ “You can’t just throw pills away. Can I have these? I’ll sell them to that guy at work who’ll buy anything in an orange bottle. I think he’s doing really well in his personal life?”
~ “I think you have to actually have had an acting job to be called that. Technically, I’m as much of a ninja as I am an actress.”
~ “She’s cute, but that skin colour is not found in nature.”
“Sure it is. It’s called whore-ange. It’s like dating an Oompa Loompa.”
~ “You finished yet?”
“With the sentence I was reading the last time you asked me? Almost.”
~ “There are three things in this world I don’t care about. The first: European football. I don’t get it. It’s boring and nobody has a weapon. The second? Anything you think might be fun.”
“What’s the third?”
“I’ve forgotten. And you know why? Because I don’t care about it.”
~ “I’m sorry. I don’t even know you and I’m treating you like one of my shrinks.”
“One?”
“It takes a village.”
~
“Mr. Jordan, I don’t know how to thank you.”
“That’s a weird skill to be lacking.”
~ “It’s a great place. It’s got a PS3. A couch…”
“What, the list stops after couch?”
~
“I think ‘All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.’”
“Strangely profound.”
“Gandalf.”
“Less profound…but still helpful.”
~ “Personal lives are a luxury in this business and if I don’t get to have one, then you by proxy don’t get to have one.”
